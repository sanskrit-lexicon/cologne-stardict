गरुड
Garuḍa, Garutmant, Tārkṣya, Vaina-<BR>teya, Suparṇa m.: A mythical bird.<BR>A. Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73<BR>the origin is narrated in the Āstīkaparvan;<BR>mind-born (संकल्पज) son of Kaśyapa and<BR>Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vaina-<BR>teya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatā-<BR>sūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39;<BR>1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two<BR>eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot (सोपस्-<BR>वेद भाण्ड) for over a thousand years; as<BR>advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not<BR>break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20;<BR>when the proper time came Garuḍa came out<BR>of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as<BR>soon as born he left the mother and flew up<BR>in the sky, from there to seek his destined<BR>food (serpents, hence पन्नगसूदन) 1. 14.<BR>22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among<BR>the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62;<BR>(1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the<BR>penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once<BR>Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they<BR>offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra<BR>for gods who would be a hundred times more<BR>powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27.<BR>8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajā-<BR>pati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that<BR>the one to be born as a result of their<BR>sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1.<BR>27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated<BR>as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a<BR>boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by<BR>their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma<BR>13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa<BR>was of big size (महाकायः), having<BR>blazing lustre and looking like a mass of<BR>kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought<BR>him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni<BR>not to burn the people; they were informed<BR>by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa,<BR>Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and<BR>sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa with-<BR>drew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14.<BR>B. Progeny:<BR>Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya)<BR>Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the<BR>lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of<BR>Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1;<BR>these six are thus the founders of the विनता-<BR>कुल 5. 99. 3.<BR>C. Eminence: Garuḍa com-<BR>pared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said<BR>that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13.<BR>14. 158; as the best among the birds he was<BR>counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6.<BR>32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the<BR>birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought<BR>highly of other birds whenever he con-<BR>fronted them 6. 4. 34.<BR>D. Bringer of अमृत<BR>(Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa<BR>approached his mother who, as the slave of<BR>Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean;<BR>at her instance Vainateya carried on his<BR>back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted<BR>due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when<BR>revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa<BR>carried them to a beautiful forest in an island,<BR>and from there to another island 1. 23. 1,<BR>6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do<BR>whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing<BR>the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked<BR>serpents how his mother could be freed from<BR>slavery; serpents asked him to get अमृत for<BR>them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his<BR>expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he<BR>might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the<BR>Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him<BR>never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told<BR>Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the<BR>time of his departure he was blessed by<BR>Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak<BR>and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14;<BR>a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got<BR>into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa<BR>opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his<BR>wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the<BR>Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he<BR>met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he<BR>was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; अमृत<BR>1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might<BR>eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka,<BR>(an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise),<BR>both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25.<BR>7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and<BR>the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived<BR>in the south and used to fight with each other)<BR>with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and<BR>sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch<BR>gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25.<BR>27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to<BR>save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya<BR>1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew<BR>around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went<BR>to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana<BR>mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas<BR>that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest<BR>of the living beings; they left the branch;<BR>Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked<BR>Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from<BR>Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch;<BR>as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited<BR>mountain covered with snow and there ate the<BR>elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as<BR>Garuḍa drew near the place of अमृत,<BR>there were bad omens for gods; when Indra<BR>enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that<BR>Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26.<BR>36-37 (called also अमृत 1. 26. 38); Bṛhas-<BR>pati told the gods that Garuḍa was of in-<BR>comparable strength and would achieve what<BR>was most difficult to achieve (असाध्यम् अपि<BR>साधयेत्) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart<BR>1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28.<BR>20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of<BR>Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were<BR>protecting अमृत (1. 28. 6), an with birds<BR>(पक्षिन्) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others;<BR>he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought<BR>with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after<BR>the fight Garuḍa saw अमृत surrounded<BR>by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety<BR>times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers,<BR>poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter<BR>the fire he became small in size 1. 28.<BR>22-25; near the अमृत he saw a wheel<BR>of iron (अयस्मय), of sharp edge, which<BR>was a device (यन्त्र) created by gods to<BR>cut down those who might try to steal<BR>Soma; as he entered through the spokes<BR>of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poi-<BR>son in their eyes (चक्षुर्विषौ), guard-<BR>ing अमृत; anyone seen by them would be<BR>reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes<BR>with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya)<BR>snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with<BR>the force of his speed he uprooted (उन्मथ्-)<BR>the यन्त्र 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not<BR>taste the अमृत but asked a boon from Viṣṇu<BR>that he should become undecaying and im-<BR>mortal without tasting अमृत 1. 29. 11, 14;<BR>without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa,<BR>as he was taking away अमृत, with his वज्र;<BR>to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from<BR>whose bones the वज्र was fashioned, the वज्र<BR>itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather<BR>from his wings, as though due to the stroke<BR>of वज्र, but otherwise was not affected<BR>by the वज्र 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather<BR>of excellent form all beings (सर्वभूतानि)<BR>said “may this bird be Suparṇa” (सुरूपं<BR>पत्रम् आलक्ष्य सुपर्णो ऽयं भवत्व् इति)<BR>1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship,<BR>and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1<BR>(Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's<BR>birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1.<BR>27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return<BR>Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of<BR>taking it away; both hatched a plan—<BR>Indra was to take away अमृत once Garuḍa<BR>had placed it before the serpents and freed his<BR>mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra<BR>granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose ser-<BR>pents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his<BR>epithets like पन्नगाशन 2. 22. 23; 5. 110.<BR>5, 15; 5. 117. 23; पन्नगसूदन 1. 14.<BR>22; भुजगेन्द्रारि 5. 110. 1; भुजगारि 10.<BR>13. 4); Garuḍa brought अमृत to serpents and<BR>placed it for them on the कुश grass; he asked<BR>them to take it after they had bathed and<BR>become auspicious (मङ्गलसंयुक्ताः); he<BR>asked serpents to free his mother from slavery<BR>from that day; the serpents agreed and went<BR>to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to<BR>roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the for-<BR>est and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa,<BR>Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that<BR>Garuḍa would free Vinatā from slavery 1.<BR>14. 18); फलश्रुति: One who hears or recites<BR>this narrative (कथा) will go to heaven due<BR>to his glorifying Garuḍa, the lord of the birds<BR>(पतगपति) 1. 30. 22.<BR>E.

Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava<BR>the etymology of the name of the direction<BR>उत्तरा (यस्माद् उत्तार्यते पापात् ‘because one<BR>is freed there from sin’ 5. 109. 1; also गुणैर्<BR>अन्यैर् दिग् उत्तरा ‘a direction superior (to<BR>others) in different qualities’, and सर्व-<BR>कर्मसु चोत्तरा ‘better (than other direc-<BR>tions) for performing all rites’ 5. 109. 24);<BR>Gālava requested Garuḍa (named variously<BR>as Garutmant, Suparṇa, Vinatātmaja,<BR>Tārkṣya, Aruṇānuja) to take him to the east;<BR>Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked<BR>Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to<BR>stand the speed of Garuḍa, Gālava requested<BR>him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further<BR>but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15;<BR>Gālava told Garuḍa that his real purpose was<BR>to obtain the eight hundred horses and since<BR>he knew no way to obtain them he thought of<BR>giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17;<BR>Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with<BR>Gālava for wanting to end his life and told<BR>him: “The time of death is not determined<BR>by any person, Kāla is rather supreme (न<BR>चापि कृत्रिमः कालः कालो हि परमेश्वरः<BR>[Nīla.: कृत्रिमः स्वेच्छासम्पाद्यः 5. 112.<BR>20 Bom. Ed.]) 5. 110. 19-20; he told Gālava<BR>that they would first repair to mountain Ṛṣabha<BR>in the heart of the ocean, eat, rest, and then<BR>return 5. 110. 22; on the peak of the Ṛṣabha<BR>mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāh-<BR>maṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her<BR>and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found<BR>himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of<BR>wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was re-<BR>duced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī<BR>and had planned to take her away from that<BR>place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī<BR>relented and told Garuḍa that he would<BR>be ‘Suparṇa’ again; Garuḍa got back his<BR>wings which were stronger than before (Nīla.<BR>द्रविणवत्तरौ = बलवत्तरौ 5. 113. 17<BR>Bom. Ed.) 5. 111. 17; Śāṇḍilī advised Garuḍa<BR>not to despise women at any time even if they<BR>deserved to be despised (न च ते गर्हणीयापि<BR>गर्हणीयाः स्त्रियः क्वचित् 5. 111. 16) 5. 111.<BR>1-17; when Viśvāmitra, on his way, saw<BR>Gālava without the horses he had asked for,<BR>he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya<BR>and said he would further wait for a period<BR>of the same duration as before; Suparṇa,<BR>having heard what Viśvāmitra had said,<BR>explained to Gālava the importance of gold<BR>and wealth (he told him the etymology of the<BR>word धन: धत्ते धारयते चेदम् एतस्मात्<BR>कारणाद् धनम् 5. 112. 2) and took him to<BR>his friend, king Yayāti, for getting wealth to<BR>purchase the required horses; when they met<BR>Yayāti, Garuḍa (विनतासुत) requested him<BR>on Gālava's behalf to part with some wealth;<BR>Garuḍa assured Yayāti that Gālava in return<BR>would give him a part of his तपस्; Garuḍa<BR>told Yayāti that since he was qualified to<BR>give a gift and Gālava to receive it his<BR>giving gift to Gālava would be like pouring<BR>milk in a conch shell (शङ्खे क्षीरम् इवा-<BR>सक्तम् 5. 112. 20) 5. 111. 18-23; 5. 112.<BR>1-20; Yayāti listened to what Suparṇa had<BR>said; he was delighted to meet Tārkṣya, his<BR>friend; but Yayāti told him that he was no<BR>longer wealthy; however as it was not meet to<BR>frustrate the hopes of a विप्रर्षि, he was pre-<BR>pared to part with his daughter Mādhavī by<BR>marrying whom to some king Gālava could<BR>acquire wealth as bride price (शुल्क) to buy<BR>the horses; Garuḍa having shown the way to<BR>Gālava to acquire the horses left him and<BR>went to his residence 5. 113. 1-16; when<BR>Gālava had procured six hundred out of the<BR>eight hundred required श्यामकर्ण horses, he<BR>met Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) again 5. 116. 21;<BR>Garuḍa (Vainateya) heard Gālava's story;<BR>he (Suparṇa) told Gālava that he would never<BR>find more than six hundred horses as, before<BR>him, Ṛcīka did not get more than six hundred<BR>horses; Garuḍa advised Gālava to give<BR>Mādhavī to Viśvāmitra in lieu of the remain-<BR>ing two hundred horses; Suparṇa then took<BR>Gālava, Mādhavī and the six hundred horses<BR>to Viśvāmitra; Gālava was thus able to pay<BR>the दक्षिणा his teacher had demanded with the<BR>help of Suparṇa; Gālava permitted Suparṇa to<BR>leave 5. 117. 1-23.<BR>F. Sumukha (a serpent)<BR>episode: Serpent Āryaka told Mātali who<BR>wanted his daughter to be married to Sumukha<BR>that Cikura, his son, was killed by Vainateya<BR>and that the same fate awaited his grand-son<BR>Sumukha in a month's time; Mātali assured<BR>Āryaka that he would endeavour to mitigate<BR>the threat of Suparṇa to Sumukha; when<BR>they all approached Indra, Viṣṇu asked<BR>Indra to give अमृत to Sumukha and make<BR>him immortal; Indra, remembering the pro-<BR>wess of Vainateya, was reluctant to part<BR>with अमृत and asked Viṣṇu himself to give<BR>it to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again,<BR>Indra gave only long life to Cikura<BR>but not अमृत 5. 102. 14-27; 5. 101. 24.<BR>G. Association with Viṣṇu: (1) As<BR>standing on his flag-staff and as his vehicle:<BR>While fetching अमृत from heaven, Vaina-<BR>teya met Viṣṇu on way; when offered a boon<BR>by Viṣṇu, Garuḍa chose that he should stay<BR>above Viṣṇu (तव तिष्ठेयम् उपरि); when<BR>Garuḍa in return offered a boon to Viṣṇu,<BR>he chose Garuḍa to serve him as his vehicle<BR>(वाहन), and since Garuḍa wanted to stand<BR>above him Viṣṇu asked Garuḍa to stand on his<BR>flag-staff (ध्वजं च चक्रे) 1. 29. 12-16;<BR>hence after the death of Jarāsandha when<BR>Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa (Garutmant), he<BR>instantly appeared and took his seat on (the<BR>flag-staff of) the chariot; the flag-staff then<BR>appeared as a raised चैत्य post 2. 22. 22-<BR>23; Kṛṣṇa's flag marked with Garuḍa when<BR>he started for Hāstinapura 5. 81. 20; when<BR>Dāruka brought Kṛṣṇa's chariot for the use of<BR>Sātyaki it was marked with Suparṇa 7. 122.<BR>43; also 7. 56. 33 (Vainateya); when Kṛṣṇa<BR>got his chariot ready to pursue Aśvatthāman,<BR>Vainateya stood on the flag-staff 10. 13. 4;<BR>when, at the end, the Vṛṣṇis were helplessly<BR>looking on, Suparṇa on the flag of Kṛṣṇa was<BR>taken away day and night by the Apsaras 16.<BR>4. 5; Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) is called गरुडध्वज<BR>7. 57. 2; 13. 11. 5; 13. 135. 51; सुपर्ण-<BR>केतु 3. 173. 15; तार्क्ष्यकेतन 2. 2. 12;<BR>12. 48. 14; तार्क्ष्यप्रवरकेतन 2. 42.<BR>55; तार्क्ष्यध्वज 8. 27. 65; (also cf. 12.<BR>46. 34); तार्क्ष्यलक्षण 12. 43. 8; Kṛṣṇa<BR>used Vainateya as his vehicle while fetching<BR>Pārijāta from Amarāvatī 7. 10. 22; he used<BR>Tārkṣya as vehicle while going to Himavant<BR>to propitiate Śiva 13. 14. 26 and Vainateya<BR>while waiting on him 13. 14. 142; Garuḍa<BR>felt he was disregarded by Indra because he<BR>stood on the flag of Indra's younger brother<BR>and because he carried him (Kṛṣṇa) on his<BR>back and was thus reduced to the state of a<BR>servant 5. 103. 13, 8; Viṣṇu asked Garutmant<BR>to bring king Vasu Uparicara from Pātāla<BR>and make him a खेचर 12. 324. 30-35;<BR>(2) Removal of Garuḍa's pride: When<BR>Garuḍa knew that Indra had granted long life<BR>to the serpent Sumukha he blamed Indra for<BR>depriving him of his food; he threatened to<BR>give up his life and said that as long as Indra<BR>was there he had nothing to do with Viṣṇu<BR>(न विष्णुः कारणं मम) 5. 103. 1-17;<BR>Viṣṇu scolded Garuḍa (Tārkṣya, Garutmant)<BR>for praising himself although in reality he was<BR>very weak; Viṣṇu told Garuḍa that he did not<BR>really carry Viṣṇu but Viṣṇu carried himself<BR>and also Garuḍa (अहम् एवात्मनात्मानं<BR>वहामि त्वां च धारये 5. 103. 20); how-<BR>ever he asked Garuḍa to carry only his right<BR>arm, and when the arm was placed on Garuḍa<BR>he fell down under its weight and became<BR>almost unconscious (विचेताः); he shed many<BR>feathers; Viṣṇu did not deprive him of his<BR>life; finally Garuḍa bowed down to Viṣṇu<BR>and begged for forgiveness 5. 103. 18-30.<BR>H. Association with Śeṣa: Śeṣa complained<BR>to Pitāmaha that his dull-witted brothers<BR>(serpents) hated their brother (cousin) Vai-<BR>nateya and he in turn hated them 1. 32.<BR>10-11; Pitāmaha then made Garuḍa<BR>(Suparṇa, Vainateya) a friend of Śeṣa 1. 32.<BR>25.<BR>I.

Padma<BR>and the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya (12. 349.<BR>5): Padma returned home after he had<BR>performed his duty of drawing the Sun's cha-<BR>riot and was permitted by the god to leave;<BR>he was then informed by his wife about<BR>the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa; she informed<BR>Padma that the Brāhmaṇa had asked him to<BR>meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due<BR>to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the<BR>Brāhmaṇa; but on the advice of his wife he<BR>relented and met the Brāhmaṇa; he then told<BR>his wife that he realized that it was not in<BR>one's interest to get angry for in bygone days,<BR>Rāvaṇa, Kārtavīrya and his sons were killed<BR>due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he appro-<BR>ached the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya and asked<BR>him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the<BR>Brāhmaṇa first asked Padma a question; after<BR>hearing Padma's answer, the Brāhmaṇa would<BR>tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349.<BR>16; the Brāhmaṇa asked Padma to tell him if<BR>while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw<BR>anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1;<BR>Padma first told the Brāhmaṇa that there was<BR>nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself<BR>(accomplished sages and deities resort to his<BR>rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows<BR>from there to fill the sky; rain water is released<BR>by his dark foot (ray ?), Śukra by name,<BR>(शुक्रो नामासितः पादो यस्य वारिधरो<BR>ऽम्बरे । तोयं सृजति वर्षासु 12. 350. 4);<BR>Sun takes back the rain water with his shining<BR>ray during eight months; the soul (आत्मा) is<BR>for all times established in his lustre; he is the<BR>seed of everything, movable and immovable<BR>and the earth is sustained by him; the long-<BR>armed, eternal, unalterable god having no<BR>beginning and no end resides in the sun 12.<BR>350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day<BR>something unusual happened: while the Sun<BR>was shining brightly at mid-day, there<BR>suddenly appeared light in all directions, light<BR>similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing<BR>open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun<BR>(द्वितीय इव भास्करः 12. 350. 11), appro-<BR>ached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to<BR>receive him and the other being also extended<BR>his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then<BR>the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15;<BR>confused as to who was the real Sun—the one<BR>in the chariot or the one that arrived from the<BR>sky—Padma and others asked the Sun to<BR>explain; the Sun told them that the one who<BR>entered him was a sage who observed the vow<BR>of उञ्छवृत्ति (living only on grains fallen in<BR>the field); the sage also lived successively on<BR>fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and<BR>recited the ऋच् stanzas; that Brāhmaṇa (sage)<BR>even now moved round the earth with the Sun<BR>—this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351.<BR>1-6; the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya, on hearing<BR>Padma's account, took leave of him without<BR>telling him the purpose of his visit; to the<BR>perplexed Padma, Dharmāraṇya explained<BR>that he was only curious to know what led to<BR>the accumulation of merit (पुण्यसंचय);<BR>now that he knew how one did it, he had<BR>decided to observe उञ्छव्रत; the purpose<BR>of his visit was served (कृतार्थो ऽस्मि) and<BR>hence he was leaving 12. 352. 1-10.

Palita-Lomaśa Episode: Once when<BR>the cat Lomaśa who lived on the branches<BR>of the same banyan tree was caught in the<BR>trap (उन्माथ) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla, Palita<BR>moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh<BR>and as he was eating it after taking it on<BR>the top of the trap and smiling mentally<BR>(मनसा हसन् 12. 136. 28) at his enemy,<BR>trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy,<BR>a mongoose by name Harika, approaching<BR>the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita<BR>at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an<BR>owl named Candraka, prowling from his<BR>nest situated on the branch of the same tree;<BR>apprehending danger from both directions,<BR>Palita decided to take help from the cat, his<BR>foe in distress, and find escape from all the<BR>three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed<BR>himself to the cat pointing out that there was<BR>danger to the life of both of them, that both<BR>lived on the same tree and therefore deserved<BR>to be friends of each other on the basis of<BR>common residence (सवासो मे ऽसि पण्डितः<BR>व्ल्। पण्डित 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared<BR>to cut the cords that bound the cat provided<BR>the cat agreed not to kill him when freed;<BR>Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live,<BR>and you should wish that I live” 12. 136.<BR>48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and<BR>asked Palita to do what was suited to the<BR>occasion; Palita swore by truth (सत्येन ते<BR>शपे 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net pro-<BR>vided the cat agreed not to kill him when he<BR>descended and crawled very close to the body<BR>of the cat (अहं त्वानुप्रवेक्ष्यामि 12.<BR>136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita<BR>went near the cat and rested quietly on his<BR>chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the<BR>owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82;<BR>Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of<BR>the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish<BR>the work quickly, Palita advised him to be<BR>patient; Palita would complete cutting the<BR>net only when he saw the Caṇḍāla, who had<BR>spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat<BR>might prove dangerous to him; if the cat,<BR>when freed, saw the Caṇḍāla drawing near<BR>he would immediately mount the tree and<BR>not waste his time in jumping on the mouse;<BR>Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136.<BR>83-93; when the cat persisted in asking<BR>Palita to make haste, Palita replied as<BR>follows: “I have made treaty with one who<BR>is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect<BR>myself; no one has any regard for the doer of<BR>a good act, once the act has been fully done;<BR>hence all good acts must be done with a part<BR>left unfinished (न हि कश् चित् कृते कार्ये<BR>कर्तारं समवेक्षते । तस्मात् सर्वाणि<BR>कार्याणि सावशेषाणि कारयेत् 12. 136. 105);<BR>now only one cord remains; I shall cut down<BR>that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107;<BR>at dawn when the Caṇḍāla Parigha appeared,<BR>true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord;<BR>the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up<BR>the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136.<BR>109-116; when the Caṇḍāla left the scene, the<BR>cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and<BR>move freely among the cats without appre-<BR>hending any danger; he asked Palita to become<BR>his minister and even guide him like his father<BR>(अमात्यो मे भव प्राज्ञ पितेव हि प्रशाधि<BR>माम्) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to<BR>oblige; he told the cat that there were no natu-<BR>ral friends and no natural foes; hence there<BR>were no permanent friendships and no perma-<BR>nent enmities; friendships and enmities arise<BR>due to certain common or conflicting interests<BR>(नास्ति जात्या रीपुर् नाम मित्रं नाम न<BR>विद्यते । सामर्थ्ययोगाज् जायन्ते मित्राणि<BR>रिपवस् तथा ॥ नास्ति मैत्री स्थिरा नाम<BR>न च ध्रुवम् असौहृदम् । अर्थयुक्त्या<BR>हि जायन्ते मित्राणि रिपवस् तथा ॥ 12. 136.<BR>132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced<BR>trust cuts at the very roots; the affection bet-<BR>ween them arose for some purpose; once that<BR>purpose was served, friendship lost its ground;<BR>mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was<BR>weak cat strong; there could be no real<BR>conciliation (सन्धि) among parties of uneven<BR>strength; Palita said he knew that it was the<BR>cat's food time; that was the reason why the<BR>cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally<BR>told the cat that if he remembered Palita's<BR>good act let him wish well of the mouse (शिवं<BR>ध्यायस्व मे ऽत्रस्थः सुकृतं स्मर्यते<BR>यदि) 12. 136. 160-166; the cat made one<BR>more attempt to win the confidence of Palita<BR>and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did<BR>not relent; he recited two गाथास् of Uśanas<BR>(apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit<BR>of the cat the purport of which was that if one<BR>made conciliation (सन्धि) with a person<BR>stronger than himself to face a common enemy<BR>he should not repose trust in his partner after<BR>the purpose was served and that in all condi-<BR>tions one should protect one's life since wealth<BR>and children could be acquired if one remained<BR>alive; Palita concluded that the sum and<BR>substance of the नीतिशास्त्रस् was that distrust<BR>was the best policy (सङ्क्षेपो नीतिशास्त्राणाम्<BR>अविश्वासः परो मतः 12. 136. 187); Palita<BR>finally told the cat that the mouse must protect<BR>himself from the cat as the cat must protect<BR>himself from the Caṇḍāla; the cat, apparently<BR>scared at hearing the word ‘Caṇḍāla’, ran<BR>to his hole and Palita entered another hole;<BR>thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself,<BR>outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136.<BR>182-192.

पूजनी
Pūjanī f.: A female bird (शकुनी<BR>12. 137. 5; शकुनिका 12. 137. 108).<BR>A. Residence: She lived for a long<BR>time in the inner apartments (अन्तःपुर-<BR>वासिनी) of king Brahmadatta Kāmpilya 12.<BR>137. 5.<BR>B. Qualities: Although born<BR>in the lower species she knew everything; she<BR>was conversant with धर्म and, like a जीव-<BR>जीवक (a bird who helps telling future ?;<BR>one who prophesies with the help of such<BR>a bird ? Nīla जीवजीवकः शाकुनिकः स हि<BR>अयं पक्षी अस्यां दिशि लाभं अस्याम्<BR>अलाभं दिशतीति वर्णयति । पक्षिविशेस इत्य्<BR>अन्ये on 12. 139. 6 Bom. Ed.), understood<BR>the meaning of the cries of all beings<BR>(रुतज्ञा सर्वभूतानां यथा वै जीवजीव-<BR>कः) 12. 137. 6.<BR>C. Her son's death:<BR>Her lustrous son grew in the palace with<BR>the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the<BR>seashore two fruits, one for her son and one<BR>for the prince; one day the prince, while play-<BR>ing with the young bird, killed him in a<BR>secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with<BR>two fruits she found her young one dead; she<BR>lamented over her son's loss and blamed the<BR>Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided<BR>to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the<BR>prince with her talons; she said that a sinful<BR>act, deliberately committed, returned quickly<BR>on the doer and that taking revenge did not<BR>destroy one's good and bad (?) acts (इच्छ-<BR>यैव कृतं पापं सद्य एवोपसर्पति ।<BR>कृतप्रतिक्रियं तेषां न नश्यति शुभा-<BR>शुभम्) 12. 137. 7-19.<BR>D. King Brahma-<BR>datta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta<BR>asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him<BR>since she had already retaliated for the<BR>misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree<BR>with the king saying that wise men recom-<BR>mended abandoning the place where misdeed<BR>was committed; enmities, once arisen, never<BR>subsided, hence no trust should be reposed<BR>in the enemy; the purpose for which she<BR>lived in the palace was no longer there;<BR>spirited men should abandon the place<BR>where after receiving honour they are dis-<BR>honoured; she said to the king: “I have<BR>lived here long enough; now I go, may you<BR>be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded<BR>with her saying that when some one retali-<BR>ated nothing wrong was committed and there-<BR>fore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did<BR>not consent saying that enmities never passed<BR>off (नास्ति वैरम् उपक्रान्तम् 12. 137. 34);<BR>no one should feel secure with the thought<BR>that reconciliation had come about; she<BR>pointed out to the king five causes of<BR>enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad)<BR>speech, rivalry, and misdeed (स्त्रीकृतं<BR>वास्तुजं वाग्जं ससपत्नापराधजम् 12.<BR>137. 38); she lived with the king as long as<BR>nothing wrong happened; once that happened,<BR>she could trust the king no more; the king<BR>then put the entire responsibility of what had<BR>happened on Time (Kāla); since men were<BR>driven to act by Time nobody did anything<BR>wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī<BR>for her act, so should she forgive him for<BR>what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted<BR>saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for<BR>everything, why did men seek to take revenge ?<BR>Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each<BR>other ? Why did men give and take medicines<BR>during illness ? She injured the king's son<BR>who had killed her son; now it was the king's<BR>turn to capture her; men wanted birds<BR>either for eating or for sporting; there was no<BR>third ground for the two to come together; if<BR>Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would<BR>be revived every time she remembered her<BR>son; she then recited two गाथास् which<BR>Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137.<BR>67-68); the purport of the गाथास् was that<BR>one who trusted the words of enemies was<BR>killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed<BR>in a well) covered with dry grass (ते<BR>श्रद्दधाना वध्यन्ते मधु शुष्कतृणैर्<BR>यथा । Nī. शत्रुणा दर्शितं पुरःस्थितं<BR>मधु श्रद्दधाना शुष्कतृणैश् छन्ने<BR>प्रपाते यथा पतन्ति तद्वद् एते इत्य् अर्थः<BR>on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities conti-<BR>nued because they were told to successive<BR>generations; when Brahmadatta further<BR>argued that trust had to be placed some-<BR>where to achieve one's objective or else one<BR>would live like a dead person, Pūjanī<BR>replied that if a person continued to run<BR>with injured feet, his feet got more hurt;<BR>she gave the king a long lecture on how one<BR>should guard one's interest by remaining<BR>alert and with constant exertion; one should<BR>leave the place where one was dishonoured;<BR>since Brahmadatta's son had done something<BR>which could not be repaired she had to leave<BR>the place; she also lectured on the king's<BR>duties (offering protection to subjects and<BR>not torturing them by levying heavy taxes);<BR>having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137.<BR>70-108); this conversation (सह भाषीतम्)<BR>between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated<BR>by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109).

Rāja-<BR>dharman) हि माम् आश्रितः सदा) 12. 165. 8;<BR>hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was<BR>prepared to give Gautama all that he desired<BR>12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gau-<BR>tama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with<BR>him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's<BR>residence under the न्यग्रोध tree, the<BR>latter welcomed Gautama and tried to<BR>remove his fatigue by fanning him with<BR>wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27;<BR>Gautama thought of returning home but<BR>since he had nothing to eat on way the<BR>ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rāja-<BR>dharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165.<BR>31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with<BR>flames for the protection of Gautama at<BR>night, and he slept by the side of Gautama<BR>fully trusting him (विश्वस्त); Gautama<BR>killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he<BR>dressed the bird by removing his wings and<BR>hair (स तं विपक्षरोमाणं कृत्वा 12.<BR>166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking<BR>the gold and meat with him Gautama<BR>started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of<BR>days passed without Rājadharman's going to<BR>meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the<BR>Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about<BR>Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that<BR>Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was,<BR>might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore<BR>asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence<BR>and find out whether he was alive; Virū-<BR>pākṣa's son saw near the न्यग्रोध tree only<BR>a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his as-<BR>sociates pursued Gautama, captured him, and<BR>returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rāja-<BR>dharman which was without wings, bones and<BR>feet (°शरीरं च पक्षास्थिचरणोज्झितम्<BR>12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lame-<BR>nted over the loss of his friend and prepared a<BR>funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread<BR>over with perfumes and many pieces of<BR>cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman,<BR>Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral<BR>rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter<BR>of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre<BR>(in the sky); the foam from her mouth,<BR>mixed with milk, fell down on the burning<BR>pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and<BR>met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived<BR>on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman<BR>was alive (दिष्ट्यायं जीवतीत्य् उत 12. 167.<BR>6); Indra told them an old incident (पुरा-<BR>तनम् 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion,<BR>Rājadharman had failed to present himself<BR>in the assembly (सदस्) of Brahmadeva; the<BR>enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die<BR>soon (तस्माद् वधं स दुष्टात्मा नचिरात्<BR>समवाप्स्यति 12. 167. 9 [न चिरात् seems to<BR>contradict पुरातनम्]); hence Rājadharman<BR>was killed by Gautama, but was again<BR>revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12.<BR>167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably dis-<BR>posed to Rājadharman he was requested by<BR>Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life;<BR>Indra revived Gautama and gave him to<BR>Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman em-<BR>braced Gautama who had with him all kinds<BR>of vessels full of gold (सभाण्डोपस्करम्<BR>12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of<BR>Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14;<BR>Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of<BR>Brahmadeva and was received with guest<BR>worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rāja-<BR>dharman and Gautama is called आख्यान<BR>12. 167. 18.<BR>[See Nāḍījaṅgha]

Palita-Lomaśa Episode: A mouse,<BR>Palita, also lived in a hole at the foot of the<BR>banyan tree; Lomaśa, although normally<BR>watchful (अप्रमत्त 12. 136. 25), was once<BR>caught in a trap (उन्माथ 12. 136. 23) fixed<BR>by a Cāṇḍāla; when this happened Palita<BR>began to move about freely, got a piece of<BR>flesh, and started eating it on the top of the<BR>trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught<BR>in the trap below; just then the mouse<BR>Palita saw his two other enemies, an<BR>ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the<BR>tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately<BR>realized that the cat, his third enemy in<BR>distress, was his only means of escape; he<BR>therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords<BR>of the net if the cat in return promised not<BR>to injure him when he moved near the cat<BR>to protect himself from the ichneumon and<BR>the owl; Palita wished that Lomaśa remained<BR>alive and expected a similar response from<BR>Lomaśa (तव जीवितम् इच्छामि त्वं ममे-<BR>च्छसि जीवितम् 12. 136. 59); the cat too<BR>knew that be by himself was almost at<BR>the end of his life (ताम् अवस्थाम् अवेक्-<BR>ष्यान्त्याम् 12. 136. 64) and hence spoke in<BR>conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomaśa<BR>told the mouse that he had given up his<BR>pride and that he was Palita's devotee and<BR>pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's<BR>order and work in his interest; he requested<BR>Palita to do what would serve the purpose<BR>of both of them; Palita then suggested the<BR>following plan to Lomaśa: the mouse was<BR>to go very close to the cat and while he<BR>was in that condition the cat was to protect<BR>the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon;<BR>when the danger to the mouse from the two<BR>had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of<BR>the net and free the cat; Lomaśa agreed to<BR>this plan and promised not only to be well-<BR>disposed towards Palita when he drew near, but<BR>also offered later to do, with his friends and<BR>relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse<BR>then moved very close to the cat and slept on<BR>his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and<BR>the owl had returned to their respective homes<BR>Palita started to cut off the cords of the net<BR>slowly; Lomaśa tried to hasten him asking<BR>him not to be ungrateful; Lomaśa wanted<BR>Palita to finish the work before the Caṇḍāla<BR>(श्वपच) returned; Palita refused to hasten<BR>until he was sure that the Caṇḍāla was close<BR>by so that Lomaśa, when freed, would not<BR>pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree<BR>from the fear of the Caṇḍāla; Lomaśa again<BR>pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his<BR>work pointing out that good men did not<BR>act the way Palita was going about his<BR>work; Palita should not remember their<BR>past enmity and delay in freeing the cat;<BR>Palita assured Lomaśa that he had cut off<BR>most of the cords and deliberately left only<BR>one which he would bite off at the proper<BR>time; when the night ended and the Caṇḍāla<BR>was seen arriving, Lomaśa was frightened and<BR>asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita<BR>cut off the last cord and the freed Lomaśa<BR>jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita,<BR>and Palita himself entered his hole; when the<BR>disappointed Caṇḍāla went away, Lomaśa<BR>requested Palita not to misunderstand him if<BR>he, when he became free, jumped up the<BR>tree without conversing with Palita (अकृत्वा<BR>संविदं कांचित् सहसाहम् उपप्लुतः ।<BR>कृतज्ञं कृतकल्याणं कच्चिन् मां नाभि-<BR>शङ्कसे 12. 136. 119); Lomaśa asked the<BR>mouse to trust him and come close to him as<BR>he wanted to honour Palita who had saved<BR>him; Lomaśa asked Palita to be his minister<BR>and instruct him like a father (अमात्यो मे<BR>भव प्राज्ञ पितेव हि प्रशाधि माम् 12.<BR>136. 126); the counsel (मन्त्र) of the mouse<BR>and the strength (बल) of the cat together<BR>would win victories for them (12. 136. 127);<BR>but Palita pointed out to Lomaśa that he<BR>fell into the trap due to his thoughtlessness<BR>(चपलत्वात् 12. 136. 142); thoughtlessness<BR>does not help the person himself, how can it<BR>help others ?; Palita plainly told the cat that<BR>he wanted the mouse to move close to him<BR>because he was the food of the cat; Palita<BR>refused to go near Lomaśa when that<BR>was the cat's dinner time; Lomaśa made one<BR>more plea to Palita describing himself to be<BR>the knower of duties (धर्मज्ञ), apprecia-<BR>tive of the merits of others (गुणज्ञ), grate-<BR>ful for the good act (कृतज्ञ), and fond of<BR>friends (मित्रेषु वत्सल 12. 136. 179); if the<BR>mouse forsook the cat the latter would die;<BR>Palita, however, remained firm and advised<BR>Lomaśa to protect himself from the Caṇḍāla;<BR>hearing Caṇḍāla's name, the frightened<BR>Lomaśa quickly entered his hole, and Palita<BR>entered his 12. 136. 21-191.

Vāsuki and the snake sacrifice<BR>of Janamejaya: When Vāsuki heard the curse<BR>of Kadrū, the mother of serpents, that they<BR>would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of<BR>Janamejaya (1. 13. 35), he held consultations<BR>with his brother Airāvata and other serpents<BR>to think of the remedy to nullify the curse<BR>(शापो ऽयं न भवेत् कथम् 1. 33. 1); he<BR>told them that all curses had a cure, but the<BR>curse of a mother would be difficult to avert,<BR>especially when the curse was uttered within<BR>the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e.<BR>Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not<BR>stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet<BR>they had to find a way out before it was too<BR>late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of<BR>Janamejaya did not get started or, if started,<BR>it could be defeated in its purpose (यथा स<BR>यज्ञो न भवेद् यथा वापि पराभवेत् 1.<BR>33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the sugges-<BR>tions made by serpents to avoid the snake<BR>sacrifice but did not agree with any one of<BR>them; he himself had nothing better to offer,<BR>hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time<BR>Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha<BR>Brahman had prophesied that the son of the<BR>great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having<BR>the same name would stop the snake sacrifice<BR>and free virtuous serpents from danger,<BR>Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister,<BR>who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when<BR>he came begging for a maiden; that would<BR>put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34.<BR>1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean,<BR>the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha<BR>Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very<BR>much disturbed due to the curse of his mother<BR>and that Pitāmaha should free him from his<BR>mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki<BR>had always acted for the benefit of the gods<BR>and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha<BR>had then told the gods that when the occasion<BR>arrived Vāsuki should act according to the<BR>advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25;<BR>1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great<BR>care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be<BR>the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appoi-<BR>nted various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru<BR>and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived<BR>asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jarat-<BR>kāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him<BR>about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl<BR>of his name and who was offered as alms;<BR>knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage<BR>Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the<BR>sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also<BR>told him that even after marriage it would be<BR>Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42.<BR>16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his<BR>sister had the same name as the sage and<BR>that he would support her even after marriage<BR>with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2;<BR>1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's<BR>residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru<BR>went with his wife to the shining house<BR>(वासगृहं शुभ्रम् 1. 43. 5) approved by<BR>Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru<BR>left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki<BR>about his departure and that he had lived<BR>happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife<BR>pleaded with the sage that he should not<BR>abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki<BR>would feel if he knew that her husband had<BR>left her without blessing her with a son—<BR>that being the principal purpose of their<BR>marriage—1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew<BR>about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry;<BR>but he would not pursue the sage fearing that<BR>he might curse him; he knew it was improper<BR>to ask his sister if she was with a child from<BR>Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter<BR>prompted him to do that (किं हि कार्य-<BR>गरीयस्त्वात् ततस् त्वाहम् अचूचुदम् 1. 44.<BR>6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had<BR>conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous<BR>son will be born to her; she removed his<BR>anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was<BR>happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1.<BR>44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began<BR>Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death<BR>of a large number of serpents and feared that<BR>he himself might fall into the fire; he there-<BR>fore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time<BR>had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and<BR>stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 19-<BR>26; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to ful-<BR>fil the purpose for which she was married to<BR>Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka<BR>why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1.<BR>49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was<BR>terribly upset, that he would release him from<BR>the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21;<BR>when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by<BR>saying that he felt he was revolving, that<BR>his heart was bursting, and that he had lost<BR>sense of directions as he was afflicted by<BR>the punishment inflicted by Brahman (आस्तीक<BR>परिघूर्णामि हृदयं मे विदीर्यते । दिशश्<BR>च न प्रजानामि ब्रह्मदण्डनिपीडितः 1.<BR>49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would<BR>destroy Vāsuki's fear of ब्रह्मदण्ड 1. 49.<BR>22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult<BR>task Āstīka returned to his mother and<BR>maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to<BR>them all that had happened at Janamejaya's<BR>snake sacrifice; all the serpents present<BR>were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18.<BR>H. Functions and Events: (1) He is<BR>one of the नागस् who wait upon Varuṇa in<BR>his सभा without feeling fatigue 2. 9. 8, 11;<BR>(2) present among those who arrived to greet<BR>the birth of Arjuna 1. 114. 60; (3) he sided<BR>with Arjuna when those who had gathered in<BR>the mid-region to watch the battle took sides<BR>between Arjuna and Karṇa 8. 63. 36; (4) he<BR>was one of the snakes who received the white<BR>serpent issuing from Balarāma's mouth and<BR>entering the ocean 16. 5. 14, 12; (5) after<BR>Skanda's consecration as the leader of the<BR>army (9. 43. 48) and when gifts were given<BR>to Skanda, Vāsuki gave him two snakes,<BR>Jaya and Mahājaya 9. 44. 48; (6) when<BR>Uttaṅka blew into the anus of the horse<BR>(god Fire), the house of Vāsuki and other<BR>prominent snakes in the नागलोक were cover-<BR>ed with smoke 14. 57. 46-47.

Family: One of the two daughters<BR>of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1),<BR>both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one<BR>of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59.<BR>12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24.<BR>B. Description: Divine (देवी) 1. 14. 15;<BR>beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5;<BR>shining (शुभा, also 1. 14. 5), auspicious<BR>(कल्याणी) and famous (यशस्विनी) 1. 27. 24.<BR>C. Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband,<BR>granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose<BR>to have two sons, stronger than the sons of<BR>Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a<BR>half sons as desired (? अध्यर्धं पुत्रम्<BR>ईप्सितम् 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that<BR>one of her two sons was not fully developed ?<BR>1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said<BR>“so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know<BR>that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 6-<BR>10; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs<BR>which were preserved for five hundred years<BR>in warm pots by the female attendants<BR>(सोपस्वेदेषु भाण्डेषु 1. 14. 13; Nī. सोपस्-<BR>वेदेषु उष्मवत्सु on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.);<BR>when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons<BR>came out of the eggs but nothing came out of<BR>the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and<BR>desirous of quickly having a son, broke one<BR>of the two eggs and saw her partly developed<BR>son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also<BR>1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the<BR>slave (दासी 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she<BR>vied; he also told the mother that her second<BR>son will free her from slavery if she did not<BR>break the other egg prematurely and produce<BR>a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son<BR>became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was<BR>born at proper time; as soon as born he left<BR>Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1.<BR>26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son,<BR>practised penance and observed vows; having<BR>bathed and become pure she approached her<BR>husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male<BR>child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would<BR>succeed and that she would give birth to heroic<BR>sons; he also told her to carefully bear the<BR>गर्भ; Vinatā delighted when thus addressed<BR>by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and<BR>Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa<BR>and Garuḍa called वैनतेयौ ‘sons of<BR>Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two<BR>sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas<BR>and the conception of Kaśyapa (तपसा वाल-<BR>खिल्यानां मम संकल्पजौ तथा । भ-<BR>विष्यतो महाभागौ पुत्रौ ते लोकपूजितौ)<BR>1. 27. 27; 1. 27. 1-2; besides Aruṇa and<BR>Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi<BR>also called वैनतेयाः 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62<BR>(with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place<BR>of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending<BR>from her (विनताकुल), of noble family,<BR>propagated by Garuḍa through his six sons<BR>5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya1].<BR>D. Slave<BR>of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and<BR>Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥ-<BR>śravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū<BR>later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse;<BR>Vinatā declared it to be white and asked<BR>Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a<BR>wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse<BR>had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to<BR>lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then<BR>went home agreeing to inspect the horse the<BR>next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two<BR>sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from<BR>near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1.<BR>19. 1-3; when they found that there were<BR>many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas,<BR>Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who<BR>lost the bet and was defeated was grieved<BR>to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1.<BR>20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited<BR>the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the<BR>ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence<BR>of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful<BR>Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the नागस् in the<BR>middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as command-<BR>ed and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother,<BR>carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked<BR>Vinatā why he must act as told by the ser-<BR>pents; Vinatā informed him that she having<BR>lost the wager had become the slave of her<BR>sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa<BR>how he (and his mother) could be free from<BR>slavery, told him to get अमृत for them<BR>to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12;<BR>Garuḍa got ready to fetch अमृत and<BR>asked Vinatā what he might eat on way;<BR>Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose<BR>abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean<BR>(समुद्रकुक्षाव् एकान्ते 1. 24. 2), and warned<BR>him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3;<BR>on being further asked by Garuḍa how he<BR>could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him:<BR>“who, when swallowed, burns your throat like<BR>a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāh-<BR>maṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the<BR>incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him<BR>as follows: “May Wind protect your wings,<BR>Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun<BR>the whole of you; myself shall always endeav-<BR>our for your comfort and well-being (शान्ति-<BR>स्वस्तिपरायणा 1. 24. 9); may your path<BR>be free from obstacles and may you succeed<BR>in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa<BR>met his father and told him that he was on his<BR>way to fetch सोम in order to free his mother<BR>from slavery; he also told him that he was<BR>asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was<BR>not satisfied even after eating thousands of<BR>them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might<BR>eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in<BR>getting सोम (अमृत) he approached his<BR>mother and told the serpents that since he<BR>was leaving the अमृत for them on कुश grass<BR>his mother should be freed from slavery from<BR>that day; the serpents said: “so be it”;<BR>Garuḍa then roamed in the forest with his<BR>mother Vinatā and gave delight to her 1. 30.<BR>14-17, 21.<BR>E. Functions: Vinatā is one<BR>of those (like Surasā, Surabhi and many<BR>others) who wait upon Pitāmaha in his सभा<BR>2. 11. 29, 31.<BR>F. Svāhā identified with<BR>Vinatā ?: Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa<BR>(3. 213. 50) while getting away with the seed<BR>of Agni assumed the form of a female Garuḍa<BR>(गरुडी), a female Suparṇa (सुपर्णी) to<BR>escape identification 3. 214. 7-10); 3. 215. 3;<BR>Svāhā as Vinatā (as Suparṇī 3. 215. 4) told<BR>Skanda that he was her son qualified to give<BR>her the श्राद्ध oblation (मम त्वं पिण्ड-<BR>दः सुतः) 3. 219. 12; as one of the mothers<BR>of Skanka, Vinatā, highly ferocious, assumes<BR>the form of a शिकुनिग्रह (bird-affliction ?)<BR>to torment young children until they are<BR>sixteen years old 3. 219. 26, 22, 41.

Śakula m.: A kind of fish.<BR>Three of them, friends of one another,<BR>lived together in a shallow pond which<BR>abounded in fish; one of them was characteri-<BR>zed as Prāptakālajña ‘who knows the proper<BR>time (for action), who has the presence of<BR>mind’ (also called Saṃpratipattijña, Prati-<BR>pattimant, or Saṃpratipattimant 12. 135. 9,<BR>13, 15), the other as Dīrghadarśin ‘who has<BR>forethought’, and the third as Dīrghasūtra<BR>‘who procrastinates’; seeing, once, the water<BR>level falling down, Dīrghadarśin apprehended<BR>danger and told his friends that they had<BR>better quickly move out before their way to<BR>get out was cut off; Dīrghasūtra agreed with<BR>him but saw no reason to make haste;<BR>Saṃpratipattijña, however, said that he<BR>would not fail to take the correct course when<BR>time arrived; then Dīrghadarśin, of great<BR>intelligence, went out alone to a deep lake<BR>following a water current; when the water in<BR>the lake had thoroughly flown out the fisher-<BR>men began to catch the fish by various<BR>means; Dīrghasūtra got caught with others;<BR>when the fish that were caught were being tied<BR>to strings, Pratipattimant got himself mixed<BR>with those that were tied already and he held<BR>the string tight with his mouth (and thus<BR>escaped being actually tied by the string);<BR>when the fish, thus tied, were being washed<BR>in dirt-free water, Saṃprattimant gave up<BR>the string and escaped; the dull-witted and<BR>of low intelligence Dīrghasūtra, however,<BR>invited death on himself; thus one who does<BR>not recognize the most opportune time is<BR>destroyed like Dīrghasūtra; one like Saṃpra-<BR>tipattimant, who does not provide for his<BR>welfare in advance thinking himself to be<BR>clever, meets with danger; who, like Dīrgha-<BR>darśin, adopts proper course before the danger<BR>sets in, attains great bliss; this excellent<BR>आख्यान (आख्यानम् अनुत्तमम् 12. 135. 1)<BR>pertaining to the subject of deciding what<BR>should be done and what not was related by<BR>Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 135. 1-19.

Śeṣa's<BR>place in the four व्यूहस् of the Pāñcarātra<BR>system: Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that his<BR>fourth form (मूर्ति) created imperishable<BR>(अव्यय) Śeṣa who is known as Saṃka-<BR>rṣaṇa; from him was created Pradyumna<BR>12. 326. 68; जीव is called Śeṣa Saṃkarṣaṇa<BR>12. 326. 35.<BR>G.

Part in<BR>the war with Rāvaṇa: At the instance of<BR>Sugrīva many monkey-chiefs came with their<BR>troops to help Rāma in war; they encamped<BR>near Kiṣkindhā with the consent of Sugrīva;<BR>on an auspicious day, under a favourable<BR>constellation, and at an approved hour (तिथौ<BR>प्रशस्ते नक्षत्रे मुहूर्ते चाभिपूजीते<BR>3. 267. 14), Rāma and Sugrīva marched<BR>towards the south; when they reached the<BR>ocean Rāma held consultations with Sugrīva<BR>about the means to cross the ocean 3. 267. 1,<BR>13-15, 23-24; when Vibhīṣaṇa came to<BR>Rāma, Sugrīva suspected him of being a<BR>spy 3. 267. 47; during the war Sugrīva<BR>fought a duel with Virūpākṣa 3. 269. 8; when<BR>Kumbhakarṇa struck terror in the hearts of<BR>Tāra and the other monkey-chiefs, Sugrīva<BR>attacked Kumbhakarṇa and struck him on<BR>his head with a Śāla tree; but this had no<BR>effect on the demon; Kumbhakarṇa over-<BR>powered Sugrīva and tried to forcibly take<BR>him away; seeing that, Lakṣmaṇa attacked<BR>Kumbhakarṇa 3. 271. 6-10; after Kumbha-<BR>karṇa's death Rāvaṇa sent Indrajit to kill<BR>Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva 3. 272. 2, 5;<BR>Sugrīva with other monkey-chiefs surrounded<BR>Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell on the<BR>ground struck by the arrows of Indrajit;<BR>Sugrīva rid them of arrows with the powerful<BR>विशल्या herb and by using a divine spell (विशल्-<BR>यया महौषध्या दिव्यमन्त्रप्रयुक्तया<BR>3. 273. 6); Sugrīva with others, applied<BR>water sent by Kubera to the eyes so that<BR>they could see invisible beings 3. 273. 3, 6, 7.<BR>G.

Mahāgraha: She is included<BR>among the afflictions (महाग्रह 3. 219. 41)<BR>which are not favourable to children until<BR>they are sixteen years old and are favourable<BR>afterwards; a bird perches on her head and<BR>eats the children with her 3. 219. 32, 41, 22.<BR>[See Surabhi2, Surabhyaḥ, Saurabhī,<BR>Saurabheyāḥ, Saurabheyīḥ]

Meeting<BR>with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on<BR>the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in<BR>search of heavenly lotus flowers having<BR>heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his<BR>conch near the thicket of banana trees; hear-<BR>ing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the<BR>big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep<BR>in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he<BR>hit the ground with his large tail which looked<BR>like the flag staff of Indra and produced<BR>sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched<BR>forward to search the source of this sound<BR>he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stone-<BR>slab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146.<BR>59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 65-<BR>71; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant<BR>opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly<BR>at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke<BR>him up who was happily asleep; he told<BR>Bhīma that as an intelligent human being<BR>Bhīma should have shown compassion for<BR>other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know<BR>his धर्म; Hanūmant then asked Bhīma<BR>the purpose of his arriving at a place which<BR>was not supposed to be visited by human<BR>beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could<BR>not be crossed unless one had acquired per-<BR>fection (सिद्धगति 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant<BR>advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits<BR>to be found there which were as good as<BR>अमृत and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma<BR>introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇ-<BR>ḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded<BR>with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather<BR>than proceed further and meet with danger;<BR>when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed<BR>and for that purpose Hanūmant should get<BR>away from his path, Hanūmant replied that<BR>it was not possible for him to move as he was<BR>suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must pro-<BR>ceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma<BR>said he was prepared to go beyond him and<BR>the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the<BR>ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that<BR>Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant<BR>was his brother, meritorious, brave and in-<BR>telligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed<BR>the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing<BR>Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of<BR>his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he<BR>could not move due to old age Bhīma should<BR>set aside his tail from the path and proceed;<BR>Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail<BR>and stood with his face turned down due to<BR>shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking<BR>for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant<BR>to reveal his identity and let him know whether<BR>he was a सिद्ध, a god, a Gandharva, or a<BR>Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147.<BR>17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he<BR>really was and that he used to live with<BR>Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since<BR>the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin<BR>3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma<BR>that he had gone out with other crores of<BR>monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed<BR>by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had<BR>then jumped over the ocean, one hundred<BR>योजनस् wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house,<BR>and returned after announcing himself to<BR>Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for<BR>Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following<BR>boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the<BR>story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted<BR>to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the<BR>narrative of Rāma (तस्य वीरस्य चरितम्<BR>3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant<BR>again told Bhīma that no mortal could go<BR>beyond the point where they met since it was<BR>frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed<BR>Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the<BR>should be attacked or cursed by some one, and<BR>that the lake he was searching for was close<BR>by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant<BR>that he was highly blessed by his meeting with<BR>Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the<BR>unrivalled form which he had assumed when he<BR>leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would<BR>believe what Hanūmant had told about him-<BR>self; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was<BR>not possible to assume forms of the bygone age;<BR>one acquired the strength, form and prowess<BR>according to the युग in which one lived; he<BR>had to follow the (rule of the) युग, since no<BR>one could go beyond Time (युगे युगे । बल-<BR>वर्ष्मप्रभावा हि प्रहीयन्त्य् उद्भवन्ति<BR>च … युगं समनुवर्तामि कालो हि दुर-<BR>तिक्रमः 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted<BR>in his request, Hanūmant increased his body<BR>immensely to look like mountain Maināka<BR>and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed<BR>to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description<BR>of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant<BR>told Bhīma that he could grow even more,<BR>as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested<BR>Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3.<BR>149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma<BR>asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rā-<BR>vaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā,<BR>Hanūmant told him that if he had killed<BR>Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3.<BR>149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma<BR>to depart and showed him the way leading<BR>to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of<BR>Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the<BR>flowers himself and asked him to show regard<BR>for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act<BR>rashly but follow the धर्म 3. 149. 21-24;<BR>Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on<BR>धर्म to Bhīma (explaining to him त्रयी,<BR>वार्ता and दण्डनीति; the duties of the four<BR>वर्णस्; the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52;<BR>Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced<BR>Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue;<BR>with faltering voice and tears in his eyes<BR>Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and<BR>not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having<BR>embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was<BR>happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant<BR>offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished<BR>Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the<BR>sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with<BR>a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanū-<BR>mant that he (H.) had already done all that he<BR>could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only<BR>asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour;<BR>the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their<BR>support which would help them to win the war;<BR>hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to<BR>brotherly feelings and friendliness (भ्रातृत्वात्<BR>सौहृदाच् चापि 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma<BR>roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his<BR>roar to it and increase its volume; he would<BR>stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar<BR>which would deprive the enemies of their<BR>lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described<BR>as marked by a monkey (वानर, कपि,<BR>शाखामृग, but the monkey is not named<BR>Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7,<BR>9, 20, 27; 6. 67. 3; 6. 78. 9; 6. 112. 114; 7.<BR>9. 14; 7. 17. 21; 7. 80. 8, 9 (the monkey<BR>terrified the army of the Kauravas); 7. 80.<BR>29; 7. 102. 6; 7. 114. 81; 9. 9. 59; 10. 12.<BR>25; 14. 51. 54; 14. 82. 29; 14. 83. 12, 23.<BR>so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150.<BR>14-15.<BR>F. Meeting with Rāma and the fight<BR>between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma<BR>and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśya-<BR>mūka mountain and saw five monkeys,<BR>Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva,<BR>approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first<BR>talked with Hanūmant and then approached<BR>Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264.<BR>9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and<BR>Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish<BR>between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland<BR>round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33.<BR>G. Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā,<BR>when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs<BR>were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on<BR>way they rested in the मधुवन; Sugrīva<BR>interpreted this behaviour (प्रणय 3. 266.<BR>28) as indicating that Hanūmant and others<BR>were successful in their mission; the monkey-<BR>chiefs who had gone for the search then<BR>approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva<BR>3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of<BR>Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood<BR>that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed<BR>Rāma that he had brought the good tidings;<BR>he then described to Rāma his search for<BR>Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the<BR>female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the<BR>Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṃpāti and<BR>obtaining from him the information that<BR>Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that<BR>Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one<BR>was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant<BR>did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu:<BR>ततः पितरम् आविश्य पुप्लुवे ऽहं माहार्-<BR>णवम्) and killing on way an acquatic<BR>Rākṣasī (जलराक्षसी) 3. 266. 57; in<BR>Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner<BR>apartment of Rāvaṇa (तत्र सीता मया<BR>दृष्टा रावणान्तःपुरे सती 3. 266. 58);<BR>having determined her identity Hanūmant<BR>approached her and told her that he was the<BR>son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma;<BR>he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were<BR>safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being;<BR>he assured her that he was a monkey and<BR>not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon<BR>arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told<BR>him that she knew him already to be Hanū-<BR>mant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa<BR>Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and<BR>permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma<BR>that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him<BR>the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a<BR>crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant<BR>then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma<BR>3. 266. 58-68.<BR>H. Encounter with indi-<BR>vidual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa:<BR>Hanūmant marched at the head of the army<BR>when it started towards the sea in the south<BR>3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa<BR>attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanū-<BR>mant rushed towards him; this act inspired<BR>confidence in the monkeys; the fight between<BR>the two was fierce like the one between Indra<BR>and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant<BR>with maces (गदा) and clubs (परिघ),<BR>and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally<BR>Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with<BR>his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7,<BR>12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in<BR>fighting with the demons Vajravega and<BR>and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajra-<BR>vega and killed him with the summit of a<BR>mountain (अद्रिशृङ्ग) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant<BR>was among the monkey-chiefs who watched<BR>over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell<BR>down on the ground tied with the arrows of<BR>Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who<BR>applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes<BR>which enabled them to see invisible beings 3.<BR>273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkey-<BR>chiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at<BR>Rāma 3. 274. 3.<BR>I. Sītā's boon: At the<BR>time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave<BR>Hanūmant the following boon: “You will<BR>live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts (राम-<BR>कीर्त्या समं पुत्र जीवितं ते भवीष्यति),<BR>and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait<BR>on you” 3. 275. 43-44.<BR>J. Messenger to<BR>Bharata: When Rāma approached the city<BR>of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as<BR>his messenger to give him the good news<BR>(of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came<BR>back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3.<BR>275. 59-60.

गाण्डीव
Gāṇḍīva, Gāṇḍiva nt.: Name of<BR>Arjuna's bow (Gāṇḍiva recognized by<BR>Kāśikā on P. 5. 2. 110, but very likely it<BR>occurs म्। च्।).<BR>A. Etymology: So called because it<BR>was made of गाण्डी, i. e. the bow was<BR>covered with the skin of rhinoceros (?), or<BR>because it was made of the backbone of rhin-<BR>oceros (?) (एष गाण्डीमयश् चापः … यतस्<BR>तद् गाण्डिवं धनुः 5. 96. 19; cf. गाण्डी<BR>खड्गाख्यः पशुविशेषः । तस्य विकारो<BR>गाण्डीमयः । तस्य हि पशूनां वा पृष्ठ-<BR>वंशस्य धनुः कर्तुं शक्यम् यतः<BR>गाण्डीमयत्वाद् एव तद् गाण्डीवं नाम<BR>धनुर् अभूत् । … गाण्डी वज्रग्रन्थिस् तन्-<BR>मय इत्य् अन्ये (= Sarvajñanārāyaṇa) Nī.<BR>on Bom.

History: After its<BR>creation, Brahman first held it for 1000<BR>years, and then it was held successively by<BR>Prajāpati for 800 years (?) or 503 years (?)<BR>(त्रीणि पञ्चशतं चैव), by Śakra for 85<BR>years, by Soma for 500 years, by Varuṇa<BR>for 100 years, and, up to the beginning<BR>of the अज्ञातवास, it was with Arjuna for<BR>65 years 4. 38. 39-41; it lay in the Varuṇa-<BR>loka, perhaps in Varuṇa's lake, and was<BR>guarded there by the gods 5. 96. 19; hence the<BR>how was considered as properly belonging to<BR>Varuṇa (वारुणं गाण्डिवम्) 5. 155. 5;<BR>(5. 59. 12); at the time of burning the<BR>Khāṇḍava forest, Agni asked Varuṇa to give<BR>Gāṇḍīva, which he had received from Soma,<BR>to Arjuna since he was to perform great feats<BR>with it; Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request 1.<BR>216. 3-4; (17. 1. 39); when Arjuna received<BR>it, he bowed to Agni, held the bow firmly, and<BR>strung it; at that time there was a loud noise<BR>1. 216. 17-20; 1. 55. 37; 3. 157. 20; 5. 155. 7;<BR>according to another version Arjuna received<BR>the bow, not before, but after he satisfied<BR>god Fire 2. 44. 5; 8. 57. 41; Śaṅkara told<BR>Arjuna that the Ganḍīva he now held was the<BR>same which her as Nara, had used to chastise<BR>the Daityas at the time of Indra's अभिषेक<BR>3. 41. 3-4.<BR>D.

Effects: When em-<BR>ployed, the missile released powerful arrows<BR>(? कृशाश्वतनयाः), as also sharp arrows<BR>which would fill the directions 7. 166. 38;<BR>it let loose many heavenly weapons (दिव्यानि<BR>शस्त्रवर्षाणि) and the employer (Aśvat-<BR>thāman) shone with lustre 7. 166. 50; the<BR>arrows released from it would hit the enemies<BR>as desired by the employer (Aśvatthāman);<BR>it would release rocks at will and iron-tipped<BR>arrows which would put the enemy to flight<BR>7. 166. 53-54; when Aśvatthāman produced<BR>the missile, thunderous winds carrying water-<BR>drops blew in cloud-less sky, the earth shook,<BR>and the ocean was agitated; rivers started<BR>flowing in the opposite direction; peaks of<BR>mountains were shattered; sun became turbid<BR>(कलुष), and the gods, the demons, and<BR>the Gandharvas were frightened 7. 167. 1-5;<BR>arrows with shining tips appeared in thou-<BR>sands to cover the army of the enemy and<BR>fill the directions; (hot) iron balls (कार्ष्णाय-<BR>समया गुडाः) shining like celestial bodies,<BR>शतघ्नीस् (‘hundred-killers’), fire-arms<BR>(? हुताशदाः), and disks with sharp ends<BR>(चक्राणि क्षुरान्तानि), all these were produc-<BR>ed by the Nārāyaṇāstra (7. 170. 16-19); as the<BR>Pāṇḍava warriors tried to resist the missile,<BR>it grew in strength 7. 170. 21; as a result,<BR>the Pāṇḍava army was burnt and destroyed<BR>7. 170. 22-23; to combat it successfully<BR>Kṛṣṇa advised the warriors to lay down arms<BR>and get down from their chariots and mounts<BR>7. 170. 38-42; when all followed his in-<BR>struction, Bhīma wanted to resist the missile<BR>with arrows, mace, and the strength of his<BR>arms; as a consequence, the Nārāyaṇāstra<BR>grew in strength; since other warriors<BR>had laid down their arms the missile des-<BR>cended on Bhīma with all its strength 7.<BR>170. 45-46, 50-51, 57-60; seeing Bhīma<BR>surrounded by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Arjuna tried<BR>to protect him from the missile by using<BR>Vāruṇāstra; since this was of no avail,<BR>Arjuna and Vāsudeva left from their chariot,<BR>ran to Bhīma, and entered through the cover<BR>of lustre produced by the अस्त्र; since they<BR>had no weapons, the अस्त्र did not affect them<BR>(and also because of the effect of the Vāru-<BR>ṇāstra and the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna);<BR>Bhīma was forced down by Nara (Arjuna)<BR>and Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) from his chariot and<BR>forced to give up weapons; the Nārāyaṇāstra<BR>was then pacified; the quarters became clear<BR>and gentle winds blew; the birds and the<BR>animals felt assured 7. 171. 1, 3, 6, 10-14,<BR>20-22; if Vāsudeva had not shown the way<BR>to combat the Nārāyaṇāstra it would have<BR>meant death for the enemy (of the Kauravas)<BR>7. 171. 28; but the missile was rendered in-<BR>effective and the Pāṇḍavas freed from it 7.<BR>171. 33; 8. 1. 42.<BR>E. The means to pacify<BR>the Nārāyaṇāstra: When released, the missile<BR>must kill the enemy and only then it would<BR>subside; the other ways of pacifying it were to<BR>run away from it, to lay down the arms, to<BR>beg for life, and ask refuge (वधः संख्ये<BR>द्रवश् चैव शस्त्राणां च विसर्जनम् ।<BR>प्रयाचनं च शत्रूणां गमनं शर-<BR>णस्य च ॥ एते प्रशमने योगा महास्त्रस्य<BR>परन्तप) 7. 166. 48-49.<BR>F.

Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) when<BR>the Pāṇḍava warriors reached Kurukṣetra<BR>they blew their respective conches and so did<BR>Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna 5. 149. 64-65; (ii) when<BR>the two armies were arrayed against each<BR>other, ready to fight, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna blew<BR>their conches 6. 1. 17; 6. 23. 15; (iii) Kṛṣṇa<BR>blew his Pāñcajanya at the start of the<BR>second day's war 6. 47. 25 (and presumably<BR>at the start of the war on all subsequent<BR>days); (iv) when Arjuna vowed to fight<BR>more seriously with Bhīṣma 6. 55. 102;<BR>(v) when Arjuna rushed at Bhīṣma who was<BR>fighting with other Pāṇḍavas 6. 67. 2;<BR>(vi) Kṛṣṇa blew his conch when Arjuna<BR>took the vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 51. 41;<BR>(vii) at the start of the day on which Jaya-<BR>dratha was killed 7. 64. 20; when Arjuna was<BR>heading forward looking for Jayadratha in<BR>the Kaurava army 7. 75. 31; as Arjuna was<BR>nearing Jayadratha 7. 78. 37; 7. 79. 11; at<BR>the end of the day when Jayadratha was killed<BR>7. 123. 41; [It is significant that the sounding<BR>of Pāñcajanya is mentioned on many occa-<BR>sions on the day on which Arjuna had to<BR>fulfil his difficult vow to kill Jayadratha];<BR>(viii) Kṛṣṇa blew it when Arjuna got rid<BR>of the Saṃśaptakas who had overwhelmed<BR>both of them 8. 37. 19, 15-17; (ix) at the<BR>death of Karṇa and the subsequent rout of<BR>the Kaurava army 8. 68. 57; (x) at the fall<BR>of Duryodhana 9. 60. 65; (2) Outside the<BR>epic war: Kṛṣṇa blew it to challenge Śālva<BR>when he reached Śālva's Saubhapura 3. 15.<BR>20; when Kṛṣṇa started fighting with Śālva<BR>3. 21. 12; when, during his fight with Śālva,<BR>Kṛṣṇa killed many Dānavas 3. 21. 29-30;<BR>G. Its use as a signal: (1) Kṛṣṇa had told<BR>Dāruka, his charioteer, that when he heard<BR>the sound of Pāñcajanya he was to rush to<BR>the battle-field driving Kṛṣṇa's chariot for its<BR>eventual use by Kṛṣṇa to enable Arjuna to<BR>fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 56. 36;<BR>(2) The sound was once interpreted by<BR>Droṇa to mean that Arjuna wanted to set<BR>aside other heroes and attack Bhīṣma 6. 108.<BR>14; (3) It was once interpreted by<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira to mean that Arjuna was in<BR>danger 7. 85. 35; on another occasion, the<BR>sound meant for Yudhiṣṭhira the death of<BR>Arjuna, and hence Kṛṣṇa's starting to fight<BR>7. 102. 32-33.<BR>H. End: When the time<BR>of the destruction of the Vṛṣṇis and the<BR>Andhakas arrived the blowing of Pāñca-<BR>janya in their houses was accompanied by<BR>the harsh braying of the asses 16. 3. 15<BR>[नदन्तं पाञ्चजन्यं च वृष्ण्यन्धक-<BR>निवेशने । समन्तात् प्रत्यवाश्यन्त रासभा<BR>दारुणस्वराः ॥ Does Pāñcajanya here refer<BR>not to Kṛṣṇa's special conch, but to the conches<BR>in general in the houses of the Vṛṣṇis and<BR>the Andhakas ?].

Śiva<BR>gave it to (1) Arjuna: Two accounts:<BR>(i) Arjuna desired to have Śiva's Pāśupata<BR>missile so that he could burn the Dānavas,<BR>the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the<BR>Gandharvas and the mythical serpents<BR>(पन्नगस्) in battle; he could then be a<BR>match for Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, and Karṇa<BR>3. 41. 7, 9, 11; Arjuna called it Brahma-<BR>śiras which was terrific and of fierce power<BR>(यत् तद् ब्रह्मशिरो नाम रौद्रं भीम-<BR>पराक्रमम्) 3. 41. 8; Śiva ready to give<BR>Pāśupata, his dear weapon (दयितम् अस्त्रम्),<BR>to Arjuna as he was capable of possessing<BR>(धारण), releasing (मोक्ष), and with-<BR>drawing (संहार) it 3. 41. 13; to receive<BR>it, Arjuna purified himself and remained fully<BR>attentive (शुचिर् भूत्वा समाहितः); he<BR>folded his hands and said to Śiva ‘recite (the<BR>mantra)’ (अधीष्व); Śiva then taught it<BR>to Arjuna together with its secrets and mode<BR>of withdrawal (सरहस्यनिवर्तनम्) 3. 41.<BR>17-18; the missile, like the God of Death in<BR>bodily form, then waited on Arjuna; at that<BR>time the earth trembled and there was a loud<BR>sound of conches, drums and भेरिस् by thou-<BR>sands; the gods and demons saw the missile<BR>in bodily form standing near Arjuna 3. 41.<BR>17-22; 1. 1. 109; 3. 163. 48, 51; 6. 116. 38;<BR>8. 57. 44; (ii) During the night, after Arjuna<BR>took the vow to kill Jayadratha the next<BR>day before sunset, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to<BR>acquire the knowledge of the great Pāśupata<BR>missile from Śiva in order to be able to<BR>accomplish his vow; Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna<BR>to mentally approach god Śiva; Arjuna<BR>touched water (संस्पृश्याम्भः), sat down<BR>on the ground, and mentally went to Bhava<BR>(Śiva) 7. 57. 17-19; Arjuna praised Śiva and<BR>made him favourable to give the missile 7.<BR>57. 59; Śiva told Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa that<BR>nearby there was a lake of nectar where he<BR>had left his divine bow and arrow; he asked<BR>them to get his bow and arrow 7. 57. 64-<BR>65; when they brought the bow and arrow,<BR>a Brahmacārin came from the side of Śiva; he<BR>held the bow and, putting the arrow on it,<BR>drew it according the prescriptions (व्यकर्षच्<BR>चापि विधिवत् सशरं धनुर् उत्तमम् 7.<BR>57. 75); having seen how the Brahmacārin<BR>held the bow in his grip, how he drew the<BR>string, and the posture adopted by him<BR>(तस्य मौर्वीं च मुष्टिं च स्थानं<BR>चालक्ष्य पाण्डवः 7. 57. 76), and having<BR>heard the मन्त्र recited by Śiva, Arjuna<BR>understood the way how to employ Pāśupata;<BR>the arrow was shot by the Brahmacārin in<BR>the lake and the bow was again placed in<BR>it; Arjuna then remembered the boon Śiva<BR>granted to him during his stay in the forest<BR>(आरण्यक) and his meeting Śiva, and wished<BR>that he might now receive the boon; knowing<BR>Ariuna's mind, Śiva gave him the boon, the<BR>Pāśupata missile, and wished him success in<BR>accomplishing his vow; Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna<BR>bowed down to Śiva and, when permitted to<BR>leave, delighted they returned to their camp,<BR>7. 57. 73-81; (Śiva gave missile to Arjuna<BR>7. 173. 100); (2) Besides Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa<BR>knew the use of Pāśupata 7. 57. 79; 8.<BR>57. 44; Bhīṣma is not so sure about Kṛṣṇa's<BR>knowledge of the Pāśupata 6. 116. 39.<BR>D. Effects: The missile, when released,<BR>produced thousands of tridents (शूलस्),<BR>fierce maces (गदाश् चोग्रप्रदर्शनाः),<BR>and charmed arrows having the form of<BR>serpents (शराश् चाशीविषाकाराः संभवन्त्य्<BR>अनुमन्त्रिताः) 3. 41. 10.<BR>E. Restrictions<BR>on its use: Arjuna was specifically told by<BR>Śiva that the missile was never to be used<BR>against men (न प्रयोज्यं भवेद् एतन्<BR>मानुषेषु कथंचन); Arjuna was to<BR>use the missile only if he was under<BR>severe pressure (पीड्यमानेन बलवत्),<BR>or if he wished to ward off the missiles<BR>used by his opponents (अस्त्राणां प्रति-<BR>घाते च सर्वथैव प्रयोजयेः) 3. 163.<BR>49-50; 3. 41. 15; if used against ordinary<BR>persons it would burn the entire world<BR>3. 41. 15.<BR>F. Use in the epic war:<BR>(1) Arjuna in his message to the Kauravas,<BR>sent through Saṃjaya, threatened that he<BR>would use the Pāśupata missile against them in<BR>the war 5. 47. 100; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that in<BR>the ‘sacrifice to be performed with the wea-<BR>pons’ (शस्त्रयज्ञ 5. 139. 29), the मन्त्रस्<BR>recited by Arjuna while releasing the Pāśupata<BR>and other missiles would serve as the मन्त्रस्<BR>used while performing a sacrifice 5. 139. 31;<BR>(2) Droṇa used Pāśupata against Arjuna<BR>and it was repelled (जघान) by Arjuna<BR>presumably by using the same missile 7.<BR>163. 28; (3) Karṇa used it against Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira and hence Kṛṣṇa apprehended Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira's death in the war 8. 43. 21, 18.<BR>G. Status: The Pāśupata missile surpassed<BR>all other missiles like Brāhma, Nārāyaṇa,<BR>Aindra, Āgneya, and Vāruṇa; it could<BR>destroy all weapons (सर्वशस्त्रविघातन)<BR>13. 14. 127; even gods like Indra, Yama,<BR>Kubera, Varuṇa, and Vāyu did not know it<BR>3. 41. 14; there was none who could not be<BR>killed by it; besides its use on an arrow,<BR>it could be released even by mind, eye, and<BR>speech (मनसा चक्षुषा वाचा धनुषा च<BR>निपात्यते) 3. 41. 16.

Association with Śiva: Śiva told<BR>Umā that he held Pināka to accomplish the<BR>objectives of the gods 13. 127. 48; 13. 128.<BR>7; Upamanyu saw Śiva with his Pināka bow<BR>13. 14. 122; considered as a special weapon<BR>of Hara (Śiva) 8. 66. 15; hence Śiva is<BR>called पिनाकिन् 1. 28. 20; 3. 39. 25; 3. 40. 31;<BR>3. 42. 1, 3; 3. 104. 11; 3. 221. 18; 5. 168. 5;<BR>6. 58. 52; 7. 69. 56; 7. 172. 59; 7. 173. 33;<BR>8. 49. 93; 9. 43. 33; 12. 149. 110; 12. 278. 27;<BR>13. 15. 11; पिनाकधृक् 3. 40. 27; 3. 93. 12;<BR>3. 163. 5, 42; 4. 21. 59; 6. 58. 52; 7. 172.<BR>73; 7. 173. 99; 12. 274. 31, 48; 13. 17. 72,<BR>133; 13. 127. 50; 13. 132. 27; 13. 145. 10;<BR>14. 77. 44; पिनाकपाणि 3. 40. 1; 8. 24. 102;<BR>10. 3. 29 (Rudra); 13. 14. 151; 13. 128. 20;<BR>पिनाकहस्त 12. 320. 31.<BR>B. Origin: Śiva<BR>wanted to tame sage Uśanas, a Bhārgava-<BR>relative (भार्गवदायादो मुनिः 12. 278. 7)<BR>because Uśanas had taken away the riches<BR>of Kubera; so Śiva, with शूल in hand, went<BR>to Uśanas; Uśanas using his Yogic powers<BR>appeared on the tip of the शूल; Śiva then<BR>bent the शूल to get Uśanas into his hand; the<BR>शूल, bent by the hand (पाणि), was called by<BR>Śiva ‘पिनाक’ (आनतेनाथ शूलेन पाणिना-<BR>मिततेजसा । पिनाकम् इति चोवाच शूलम्<BR>उग्रायुधः प्रभुः 12. 278. 18-19; Nīla.<BR>uses this description to suggest a fanciful<BR>etymology of पिनाक: शूलम् एव पिनाक-<BR>पदेन उवाच । यतः पाणिना अनामयत्<BR>अतः पिनाकम् । तेन आद्यपदस्याद्यन्त-<BR>वर्णाभ्यां द्वितीयस्य मध्यमाभ्यां<BR>कप्रत्यययुक्ताभ्यां पिनाकपदम् निष्प-<BR>न्नम् इति योगप्रदर्शनं कृतम् Bom. Ed.<BR>12. 289. 18).<BR>C. Description: Illustrious<BR>(श्रीमत्) 3. 40. 3 (not named); its splendour<BR>like that of a thousand lightnings (इन्द्रा-<BR>युधसहस्राभ 13. 14. 122).<BR>D. Com-<BR>parisons: (1) Bhīma's गदा compared with<BR>Pināka (of Rudra) 6. 58. 58; 6. 59. 16;<BR>or Bhīma with his गदा compared with<BR>Pinākin (Śiva) holding his Pināka 6. 58.<BR>52; (2) Arjuna's Añjalika arrow with which<BR>he killed Karṇa compared with Pināka (i. e.<BR>the arrow shot from Pināka) 8. 67. 18;<BR>(3) The arrow of Karṇa with which he<BR>removed the किरीट of Arjuna supposed to<BR>have achieved something not possible for<BR>Hara's (Śiva's) Pināka (i. e. for the arrow<BR>shot from Pināka) 8. 66. 15. [See Pināka2]

ब्रह्मशिरस्
Brahmaśiras1 nt.: Name of a missile<BR>(once called ब्रह्मास्त्र 10. 15. 21).<BR>A. History: Supposed to have arisen<BR>from Brahman's lustre (ब्रह्मतेजोभव<BR>10. 15. 7); Droṇa, after practising severe<BR>austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras<BR>from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught<BR>by Droṇa to Arjuna when he was satisfied<BR>(प्रितिमान्, प्रीयमाणः) with him (Arjuna)<BR>1. 123. 72; 10. 12. 5 and, not with great delight<BR>(नातिहृष्टमनाः), to Aśvatthāman whom he<BR>had apparently first refused to teach 10. 12. 6.<BR>B. Description: powerful missile (पर-<BR>मास्त्र) 1. 123. 78; 10. 15. 3, 6; famous as<BR>‘uncomparable’ in the worlds (असामान्यम्<BR>इदं तात लोकेष्व् अस्त्रं निगद्यते) 1. 123.<BR>76; divine (दिव्य) 10. 15. 16; outstanding<BR>(विशिष्ट) 1. 123. 74; highly irresistible (अति-<BR>दुर्धर) 1. 123. 74; fiery (महार्चिष्मत्)<BR>10. 14. 7; difficult to obtain (दुरवाप) 10.<BR>15. 9; worshipped by gods and Gandharvas<BR>(देवगन्धर्वपूजित) 10. 12. 14; capable of<BR>burning the whole earth (दहेद् यद् पृथिवीम्<BR>अपि) 10. 12. 4.<BR>C. Restrictions on its<BR>use: (1) while giving the अस्त्र to Arjuna,<BR>Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but<BR>to use it only if he was attacked in a battle<BR>by a superhuman enemy (अमानुषः शत्रुः);<BR>if released against an enemy of lesser mettle<BR>(अल्पतेजस्), the missile would burn the<BR>world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it<BR>to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash<BR>by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it<BR>even under dire circumstances in battle, espe-<BR>cially not against men (परमापद्गतेनापि<BR>न स्म तात त्वया रणे । इदम् अस्त्रं<BR>प्रयोक्तव्यं मानुषेषु विशेषतः) 10. 12.<BR>7-8.<BR>D. Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna<BR>and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to<BR>Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be dis-<BR>tinguished among his pupils (विशिष्टं सर्व-<BR>शिष्येभ्यः) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when<BR>taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled<BR>archer (भविता त्वत्समो नान्यः पुमाल्̃ लोके<BR>धनुर्धरः) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught<BR>to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal<BR>(सप्रयोगनिवर्तनम्) 1. 123. 74; its with-<BR>drawal very difficult; once released, no one<BR>except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of<BR>withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be with-<BR>drawn by one who had not observed celibacy;<BR>if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw<BR>it, it would cut his head and destroy his<BR>belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could with-<BR>draw it as he was truthful, brave, had prac-<BR>tised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher<BR>10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified<BR>to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the<BR>epic war nor outside it, even under stress<BR>(ब्रह्मचारी व्रती चापि दुरवापम् अवाप्य<BR>तत् । परमव्यसनार्तो ऽपि नार्जुनो ऽस्त्रं<BR>व्यमुञ्चत) 10. 15. 9, (ब्रह्मास्त्रम् अप्य्<BR>अवाप्यैतद् … क्षत्रधर्मान् महाबाहुर्<BR>नाकम्पत धनंजयः) 10. 15. 21; (2)<BR>Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his<BR>father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave<BR>it to him but not with a pleased mind (नाति-<BR>हृष्टमना इव) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthā-<BR>man could not make use of it) he wanted to<BR>exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana)<BR>Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invin-<BR>cible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give<BR>any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman with-<BR>out receiving from him in return his Brahma-<BR>śiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose<BR>the Cakra but failed even so much as to move<BR>it from its place 10. 12. 20-23.<BR>E. Use:<BR>As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there<BR>was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras<BR>against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12.<BR>40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an<BR>इषीका, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his<BR>Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down<BR>from the chariot with bow and arrow in<BR>hand, wished ‘well’ (स्वस्ति 10. 14. 5; 1. 1.<BR>155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself<BR>and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then<BR>bowing down to deities and teachers, he<BR>released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and<BR>saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthā-<BR>man's) missile’ (उत्ससर्ज शिवं ध्यायन्न्<BR>अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण शाम्यताम्) 10. 14. 4-6; 10.<BR>15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke<BR>out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire<BR>of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvat-<BR>thāman's missile; as a result terror struck the<BR>creatures, skies were filled with great sound<BR>and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its<BR>mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles<BR>produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11;<BR>just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, de-<BR>siring welfare for all the people, appeared and<BR>stood between the two missiles; they pointed<BR>out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any<BR>one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response<BR>to their appeal, Arjuna immediately with-<BR>drew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could<BR>not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras<BR>was pacified by the other powerful missile<BR>(परमास्त्र) there would be no rain in the<BR>land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthā-<BR>man then directed his missile towards the<BR>foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10.<BR>16. 9. [See Iṣīkā, Brahmaśiras2, Brahmā-<BR>stra]

Kṛpa, and<BR>Karṇa 3. 41. 8-11; Arjuna received it from<BR>Rudra together with the मन्त्रस् to be<BR>recited at the time of its employment, the<BR>mode of withdrawing it, and the benediction<BR>meant for expiation (if wrongly used) सम-<BR>न्त्रं ससंहारं सप्रायश्चित्तमङ्गलम्<BR>3. 89. 11 (however, Nī. प्रायश्चित्तम् अस्त्रा-<BR>ग्निना निरपराधानां दाहे यो दोषस् तस्य<BR>शोधनम् । मङ्गलं दग्धानाम् एवारा-<BR>मादीनां पुनर्विकसनम् । on Bom.

Use by Indra: 1. Incidents related<BR>to the epic: (i) Indra released his lustrous<BR>missile (स्वम् अस्त्रम् असृजद् दीप्तम्), not<BR>named, against Arjuna at the time of the<BR>Khāṇḍava fire; it produced lightnings;<BR>Arjuna repelled it by Vāyavya astra 1. 218.<BR>13, 15-16; Indra took up a thunderbolt<BR>(अशनि, महाशनि), and, charging it with<BR>Vajra missile, released it against Kṛṣṇa and<BR>Arjuna (अशनिं गृह्य तरसा वज्रम्<BR>अस्त्रम् अवासृजत्), and told the gods that<BR>the two were killed 1. 218. 29-30; Kṛṣṇa<BR>paralysed Indra who wanted to strike him<BR>with Vajra (reference to the Khāṇḍava fire ?)<BR>13. 143. 26, 23; (ii) when Indra could not<BR>dissuade Uttaṅka from desisting to dig the<BR>earth with just a stick, he joined his Vajrāstra<BR>with the stick; the earth, torn asunder by the<BR>strokes of Vajra, made way for Uttaṅka to<BR>go to the Nāgaloka 14. 57. 31-32; 2. Inci-<BR>dents not related to the epic: (i) Indra<BR>threatened king Marutta, first through Agni,<BR>that in case the king did not forsake Saṃ-<BR>varta who acted as his priest at the sacri-<BR>fice, he would hurl his Vajra at him 14. 9. 24;<BR>he again threatened Marutta, through the Gan-<BR>dharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra, that he would use his<BR>Vajra against the king 14. 10. 1, 2, 4, 7;<BR>Saṃvarta, however, assured Marutta that if<BR>Indra with his Vajra arrived to strike the<BR>king, he would paralyse Indra, and that he<BR>had destroyed before the weapons of all the<BR>gods; Saṃvarta then said: “let the wind<BR>blow and may it drive away the Vajra to the<BR>directions; let there be rain and may it fall<BR>on the forests; let waters float in the mid-<BR>region and let there be lightning in the sky<BR>(दिशो वज्रं व्रजतां वायुर् एतु वर्षं<BR>भूत्वा निपततु काननेषु । आपः प्लवन्त्व्<BR>अन्तरिक्षे वृथा च सौदामिनी दृश्यतां मा<BR>बिभस् त्वम् ॥ ) 14. 10. 13; (वज्रं तथा<BR>स्थापयतां च वायुः) 14. 10. 14; Marutta<BR>was still afraid of the sound of Vajra and of<BR>the winds, and then Saṃvarta again assured<BR>the king that he would become wind and<BR>strike down the Vajra to dispel the king's<BR>fear 14. 10. 15-16; (ii) Indra asked his<BR>missile Vajra in the bodily form (मूर्तिसंस्-<BR>थित) to turn into a tiger and kill Suvarṇa-<BR>ṣṭhīvin, son of king Sṛñjaya, as he was<BR>afraid of the prince's growing strength 12.<BR>31. 27-28; when Vajra (वज्रः) was so<BR>addressed, he began to look for a suitable<BR>opportunity and when it arrived he, as tiger,<BR>killed Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin; after killing the<BR>prince, the tiger disappeared by the माया of<BR>Indra 12. 31. 29-34; (iii) when the sage<BR>Cyavana wanted to offer Soma to Aśvinā<BR>Indra objected to it; in spite of the objec-<BR>tion, when Cyavana was about to fill<BR>the cup for the Aśvinā, Indra threatened<BR>Cyavana to strike him with Vajra; when<BR>Cyavana still proceeded to fill the cup, and<BR>Indra was about to strike the Vajra, Cyavana<BR>paralysed Indra's arm 3. 124. 8, 15-17; 14. 9.<BR>31-32; 12. 329. 14(3); 3. Mythological<BR>incidents: (i) Vṛtra episode: (a) in the<BR>battle between the gods and Vṛtra, helped by<BR>the Kālakeyas, Indra released his Vajra to kill<BR>Vṛtra; when struck by the Vajra, Vṛtra was<BR>killed 3. 99. 1-3, 13-14; however, Indra felt<BR>as if he had not released the Vajra from his<BR>hand and that Vṛtra was not killed 3. 99. 15;<BR>(b) when the gods approached Viṣṇu for his<BR>help in their fight against Vṛtra, Viṣṇu advised<BR>them to establish peace for the time being<BR>with Vṛtra, and when the proper time came he<BR>would enter the Vajra of Indra 5. 10. 11-12;<BR>Vṛtra was ready to make peace if he would<BR>not be attacked by Indra or by the gods with<BR>anything that was dry or wet, which was stone<BR>or wood, which was a weapon (शस्त्र) or<BR>Vajra, and if they would strike neither by<BR>day nor by night 5. 10. 29; Indra killed Vṛtra<BR>with foam which was fortified with Vajra;<BR>Viṣṇu had entered that foam (सवज्रम्<BR>अथ फेनं तं क्षिप्रं वृत्रे निसृष्ट-<BR>वान् । प्रविश्य फेनं तं विष्णुर् अथ<BR>वृत्रं व्यनाशयत्) 5. 10. 38; 3. 299. 15;<BR>(c) Maheśvara told Indra to kill Vṛtra<BR>with Vajra; Indra agreed 12. 272. 38-39; in<BR>the fight that ensued, Indra came with Vajra<BR>in his hand; he struck Vṛtra with Vajra; the<BR>Vajra (m.) killed him; Viṣṇu had entered the<BR>Vajra 12. 273. 5-7, 9; 12. 272. 31; 12. 274. 2;<BR>(d) in the fight between Indra and Vṛtra,<BR>when the latter covered the earth, Indra re-<BR>leased his Vajra at him; Vṛtra then entered<BR>successively water, fire, wind, and then ran<BR>to ether (आकाश); each time Indra struck<BR>him with Vajra; finally Vṛtra entered Śakra<BR>(Indra); in that condition Indra struck Vṛtra<BR>with an invisible Vajra (अदृश्येन वज्रेण)<BR>14. 11. 6-19; (ii) Viśvarūpa-Triśiras<BR>episode: (a) when the gods led by Indra<BR>approached god Brahman complaining that<BR>Viśvarupa (Triśiras), son of Tvaṣṭṛ, drank<BR>away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that<BR>they were left without a share, Brahman<BR>advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca<BR>and request him to give up his body; the gods<BR>should then fashion a Vajra from the bones<BR>of Dadhīca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhīca<BR>gave up his body, Dhātṛ fashioned a Vajra<BR>out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced<BR>from the bones of a Brāhmaṇa and in which<BR>god Viṣṇu had entered, Indra killed Viśvarūpa<BR>and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b)<BR>when Indra failed to tempt Triśiras, son of<BR>Tvaṣṭṛ, with Apsarases while he was practis-<BR>ing penance, he decided to strike Vajra at<BR>him; when struck by Vajra, Triśiras fell down<BR>like the summit of a mountain; Indra was<BR>still afraid of Triśiras and he asked a wood-<BR>cutter (तक्षन्) to cut off the heads of the<BR>lying Triśiras assuring Takṣan that he would<BR>make his axe Vajra-like (मत्प्रसादाद् धि<BR>ते शस्त्रं वज्रकल्पं भविष्यति 5. 9. 27);<BR>the woodcutter finally cut off the heads of<BR>Triśiras with his axe 5. 9. 15-34; (iii) Meet-<BR>ing of Bali and Indra: when Indra met Bali<BR>in the form of a donkey (खर 12. 216. 12),<BR>Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra<BR>with his fist although Indra was equipped with<BR>Vajra, but that that was the time to show for-<BR>bearance (क्षमा) and not valour (विक्रम)<BR>12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told<BR>Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman<BR>not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his<BR>Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra<BR>asked Bali why he was not grieved although<BR>he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220.<BR>18; Bali told Indra that he was not afraid of<BR>him (Indra) although he saw him with his<BR>Vajra raised (वज्रम् उद्यम्य तिष्ठन्तम्)<BR>12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tran-<BR>quility of Bali for he was not afraid of Indra<BR>with Vajra raised in his hand 12. 220. 89;<BR>(iv) Garuḍa episode: on his way to fetch<BR>अमृत, when Garuḍa flew to the mountain<BR>whose caves were blocked with snow, there<BR>were bad omens for the gods; Indra's dear<BR>missile Vajra blazed with pain (इन्द्रस्य<BR>वज्रं दयितं प्रजज्वाल व्यथान्वितम्) 1.<BR>26. 28; when Garuḍa was taking away अमृत,<BR>Indra struck him with Vajra; Garuḍa smiled<BR>and told Indra that just out of respect for the<BR>sage (Dadhīca) from whose bones the Vajra<BR>was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself,<BR>and Indra, he would let fall just one of his<BR>feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the<BR>missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra<BR>sought friendship with Garuḍa 1. 29. 17-23;<BR>(v) Fight between the gods and Skanda:<BR>when during the fight between the gods and<BR>Skanda, the gods abandoned Indra, he released<BR>his Vajra at Skanda; it struck Skanda on his<BR>right side and split it open; due to the impact<BR>of Vajra was produced another young man<BR>(पुरुषो ऽपरः । युवा) with golden armour,<BR>wearing heavenly कुण्डलस्, and holding<BR>शक्ति; he became Viśākha since he was pro-<BR>duced due to वज्रविशन (यद् वज्रविशनाज्<BR>जातो विशाखस् तेन सो ऽभवत्) 3. 216. 12-<BR>14 [विशन ‘opening made by the Vajra’ ?<BR>Nīla.: ‘digging up of the arm’ बाहोर्<BR>आखननात् Bom. Ed. 3. 227. 17]; (vi)<BR>Śiva and Indra: (a) Śiva, in the form of a<BR>child in the lap of Umā, froze the arm of<BR>Śakra which held Vajra (since apparently<BR>Indra wanted to strike Vajra at the child<BR>not realising that the child was Śiva); when<BR>Brahmā and the other gods propitiated Śiva<BR>(Rudra) and Umā, Indra's hand, holding the<BR>Vajra, became as before 7. 173. 60-63; 13.<BR>145. 30-34; (b) Indra once desirous to have<BR>Maheśvara's glory hurled his Vajra at him;<BR>it burnt Maheśvara's throat and departed;<BR>that is why Śiva is called Śrīkaṇṭha (तेन<BR>श्रीकण्ठता मम; Nīla. श्रकण्ठता = नील-<BR>कण्ठता on Bom. Ed. 13. 127. 47) 13. 128.<BR>8; (vii) Indra and Mandara: Mandara, son<BR>of Hiraṇyakaśipu, fought with Indra for a<BR>million years; due to the boon he had obtained<BR>from Mahādeva (Śiva) Indra's Vajra was<BR>shattered on the limbs of the “tormentor”<BR>(ग्रह ?) Mandara 13. 14. 53-54 (Nī.<BR>ग्रहस्य मन्दारनाम्नः on Bom. Ed.<BR>13. 14. 75).<BR>E. Knowledge of Vajra by<BR>Arjuna and its use by him: Arjuna learnt<BR>(अधीतवान्) the Vajra missile from Indra<BR>(and other missiles from Yama, Kubera,<BR>and Varuṇa) 3. 89. 12; (i) Mātali advised<BR>Arjuna to use Indra's favourite missile<BR>against the Nivātakavaca demons; Arjuna<BR>released (उदीरय-) it after resorting to a<BR>firm place (अचलं स्थानम् आसाद्य) and<BR>after reciting the मन्त्रस् on the Gāṇḍīva<BR>bow (गाण्डीवम् अनुमन्त्र्य च); the result<BR>was that the sharp, iron arrows released from<BR>his bow had the impact of Vajra (अमुञ्चं<BR>वज्रसंस्पर्सान् आयसान् निशिताञ् शरान्);<BR>the arrows, propelled by the Vajra and which<BR>had themselves become Vajra-like (ते वज्र-<BR>चोदिता बाणा वज्रभूताः) pierced the मायास्<BR>of the demons and the demons themselves;<BR>they all fell down on the ground when struck<BR>by the impact (वेग) of Vajra; the arrows<BR>killed also those demons who had entered the<BR>ground 3. 169. 12-17; (ii) Arjuna used the<BR>Vajra missile to kill the Saṃśaptaka warriors<BR>who showered arrows at Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna<BR>to completely cover them 7. 26. 19-20.<BR>F.

Its use<BR>for punishment and not as a missile:<BR>(1) Sudhanvan warned Prahlāda that if,<BR>in reply to a question, he told what was<BR>false, Indra would pound his head with Vajra<BR>into hundred pieces 2. 61. 63; (2) Bṛha-<BR>spati told the gods what had been proclaimed<BR>by Brahman in ancient times (पुरा गीतं<BR>ब्रह्मणा 5. 12. 18): if one hands over<BR>to the enemy the person who has sought<BR>refuge, the gods with Indra strike him with<BR>Vajra 5. 12. 21.<BR>H. Status: The best<BR>among the weapons (आयुधानां वरो वज्रः<BR>(m.)) 4. 2. 13; an object of worship and<BR>honour: (i) when Vajra struck Vṛtra's<BR>head, it (the Vajra) was shattered into ten,<BR>and then into hundred pieces; the gods shared<BR>the pieces of Vajra among themselves and<BR>worshipped them; (ii) whatever is efficaci-<BR>ous in the world is supposed to have the<BR>built of Vajra (लोके यत् साधनं किंचित्<BR>सा वै वज्रतनुः स्मृता 1. 158. 48);<BR>hence a Brāhmaṇa's hand is considered<BR>to be made of Vajra, a Kṣatriya has his<BR>chariot of Vajra, a Vaiśya's gift is as<BR>efficacious as Vajra, and those junior to a<BR>Vaiśya (the Śūdras) are supposed to have<BR>Vajra's strength in their service; the horses<BR>of a Kṣatriya are as good as Vajra and<BR>hence they are inviolable (वज्रपाणिर् ब्राह्-<BR>मणः स्यात् क्षत्रं वज्ररथं स्मृतम् ।<BR>वैश्या वै दानवज्राश् च कर्मवज्रा यवी-<BR>यसः ॥ वज्रं क्षत्रस्य वाजिनो अवध्या<BR>वाजिनः स्मृताः) 1. 158. 49-50; however,<BR>Vajra made ineffectual when Nīlakaṇṭha<BR>(Śiva) granted a boon to Nārāyaṇa that<BR>Vajra will not have any effect on him 7.<BR>172. 77-78.<BR>II. As Kṛṣṇa's missile: Kṛṣṇa cut off<BR>all the mountains hurled at him by a demon<BR>fighting from the side of Śālva, with his<BR>dear missile Vajra which was capable of<BR>breaking all rocks (सर्वपाषाणभेदन)<BR>3. 23. 17.<BR>III. As Śiva's missile: Śiva is called<BR>वज्रिन् 7. 172. 59; 13. 15. 11; 13. 17. 128;<BR>and वज्रहस्त 13. 17. 70.<BR>IV. Vajra as a general missile, not<BR>associated with any individual: Many Vajras<BR>were used during the fight between Bhīma<BR>and Karṇa 7. 113. 20; Vajras were used by the<BR>Rākṣasas of Ghaṭotkaca against the Kaurava<BR>army 7. 154. 36; even the blades of grass<BR>acted like Vajras when the time was ripe<BR>(mode of expression) (पक्वानां हि वधे<BR>सूत वज्रायन्ते तृणान्य् अपि) 7. 10. 47.

वज्र
Vajra2 m.: Name of a व्यूह (a parti-<BR>cular arrangement of the army).<BR>A. Origin: It was designed by Indra<BR>(विहितं वज्रपाणिना) 6. 19. 7.<BR>B. Des-<BR>cription: highly invincible (परमदुर्-<BR>जय) 6. 19. 7; (अजेयो मानुषे लोके) 6. 19.<BR>35; immovable (अचल) 6. 19. 7; difficult<BR>to penetrate (दुर्भिद), watching on all<BR>sides (सर्वतोमुख), and terrible (घोर)<BR>6. 19. 34.<BR>C. Use in the epic war:<BR>(1) Arjuna arranged the Pāṇḍava army<BR>according to this Vyūha on the first day of<BR>the war 6. 19. 6-7, 35; Bhīma led it<BR>(भीमसेनो ऽग्रणीस् तेषाम्) 6. 19. 18,<BR>(दृष्ट्वाग्रतो भीमसेनम्) 6. 19. 44,<BR>(भीमसेनो … प्रचकर्ष महत् सैन्यम्)<BR>6. 19. 32; 6. 19. 8, 9; also in the forefront<BR>stood Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and<BR>Dhṛṣtaketu; Nakula and Sahadeva acted as<BR>the protectors of the wheels of Bhīma's<BR>chariot (चक्ररक्षौ 6. 19. 20), and the<BR>sons of Draupadī and Abhimanyu protected<BR>Bhīma from behind (पृष्ठगोपाः 6. 19. 20);<BR>Dhṛṣṭadyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas,<BR>offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21);<BR>the king (Virāṭa ?), surrounded by an army,<BR>अक्षौहिणी strong, together with his brothers<BR>and sons guarded them from behind;<BR>Śikhaṇḍin, guarded by Arjuna, followed them;<BR>Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) protected Arjuna<BR>from behind (पृष्ठगोप) and Yudhā-<BR>manyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheel-<BR>protectors (चक्ररक्षौ); Yudhiṣṭhira, with<BR>elephants, took position in the middle; the<BR>Pāñcāla king Yajñasena with an army,<BR>अक्षौहिणी strong, marched behind Virāṭa;<BR>Dhṛṣṭadyumna, having moved from<BR>his position, with his brothers and sons,<BR>protected Yudhiṣṭhira from behind; hundreds<BR>and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the<BR>front to protect Bhīmasena, while ten thou-<BR>sand elephants followed Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 19.<BR>18-31; according to 6. 22. 1-6, where the<BR>name of the Vyūha is not mentioned but<BR>the description of which apparently applies to<BR>the arrangement of the Pāṇḍava army on the<BR>first day, Yudhiṣṭhira himself directed the<BR>contingents (अनीकानि) of his army to counter<BR>the Vyūha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhīṣma;<BR>Śikhaṇḍin's contingent stood in the middle,<BR>protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhṛṣṭa-<BR>dyumna's contingent was protected by Bhīma<BR>himself; the contingent on the right side of the<BR>Vyūha (अनीकं दक्षिणम्) was protected by<BR>Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); Yudhiṣṭhira's chariot<BR>was stationed in the midst of elephants;<BR>Bhīma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is<BR>said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero<BR>(वीररथस्य गोप्ता i. e. Arjuna ? Dhṛṣṭa-<BR>dyumna ?), but his position seems to be in<BR>the front of the army (सेनाग्रगतम्) 6.<BR>22. 12-13; in many respects, this description<BR>of the Vyūha agrees with that of the Vajra<BR>given above (6. 19. 18-31); (2) On the<BR>seventh day of the war Yudhiṣṭhira himself<BR>used the Vajravyūha for his army (of which<BR>no details are available) to counter the<BR>Maṇḍalavyūha of the Kaurava army 6. 77. 21.

Effects: Arjuna<BR>created wind by the use of the Vāyavya astra<BR>(वायव्येनासृजद् वायुम्) 1. 125. 19; the<BR>wind that was released by the use of the<BR>missile agitated the sky, felled the trees, and<BR>killed soldiers 6. 98. 18-20; when used against<BR>the Saṃśaptakas, god Vāyu (भगवान्<BR>वायुः) swept them away together with their<BR>horses, elephants, chariots and weapons, like<BR>dried leaves; they appeared like birds flying<BR>away from trees 7. 18. 22-23. [See<BR>Vāyuvarṣa]

वायुवर्ष

What the Śakti meant<BR>to Karṇa: Karṇa had great confidence due to<BR>the Śakti (अयं च प्रत्ययः कर्णे शक्त्या)<BR>7. 157. 31; when Vāsava (Indra) gave the<BR>Śakti to Karṇa, he (Karṇa) felt that Arjuna<BR>was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with<BR>Śakti in Karṇa's hand, no one in the world<BR>dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karṇa had<BR>preserved the Śakti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33;<BR>7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the Śakti meant<BR>death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duḥśāsana,<BR>Śakuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always<BR>counselled Karṇa not to use the Śakti against<BR>any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf.<BR>7. 157. 19-21 for the use of Śakti (not named)<BR>only against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa); if on any<BR>occasion Karṇa's other missiles had failed and<BR>if he was pressed (पीडितः) by the circums-<BR>tances, he would certainly have used his<BR>Vāsavī Śakti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54;<BR>hence Kṛṣṇa protected Arjuna particularly<BR>from the unfailing Śakti which, if released,<BR>would certainly have killed him like the light-<BR>ning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16;<BR>according to Vyāsa too if Arjuna and<BR>Karṇa had clashed, the latter, after exhaus-<BR>ting all other missiles, would have surely<BR>used Vāsavī against Arjuna 7. 158. 56;<BR>Kṛṣṇa was therefore always looking for a<BR>way to render the unfailing Śakti futile<BR>(अमोघां तां कथं शक्तिं मोघां<BR>कुर्याम्) 7. 157. 29; when the Śakti was<BR>diverted on Ghaṭotkaca, Karṇa, in the<BR>opinion of Kṛṣṇa, was as good as dead<BR>7. 155. 12; when Karṇa was relieved<BR>of his Śakti, he became an ordinary<BR>human being (सो ऽद्य मानुषतां<BR>प्राप्तो विमुक्तः शक्रदत्तया 7. 155. 27),<BR>and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33.<BR>D. Why the Śakti was not used against<BR>Arjuna: Both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sātyaki asked<BR>Saṃjaya and Kṛṣṇa respectively why the Śakti<BR>was not used by Karṇa against Arjuna 7.<BR>157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) accor-<BR>ding to Saṃjaya's reporting, Duryodhana,<BR>Śakuni, Duḥśāsana, and he himself urged<BR>Karṇa every night after the day's war to use<BR>his Śakti the next day against Arjuna or<BR>Kṛṣṇa (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was<BR>forgotten the next day during the fight due<BR>to the watchfulness of Kṛṣṇa (सा तु बुद्धिः<BR>कृताप्य् एवं जाग्रति त्रिदशेश्वरे । अप्रमेये<BR>हृषीकेशे युद्धकाले व्यमुह्यत) 7. 157. 27;<BR>Kṛṣṇa also never brought Arjuna face to face<BR>with Karṇa as long as the latter was equipped<BR>with Śakti; Kṛṣṇa managed to see that<BR>other warriors faced Karṇa 7. 157. 28-29;<BR>according to Saṃjaya, again, the previous<BR>night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten<BR>by Karṇa the next day due to the deities<BR>(unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes<BR>(on the side of the Kauravas), and thus<BR>it was primarily due to the working of the<BR>fate that Karṇa did not employ his Śakti<BR>against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa to kill any one of<BR>them (ततः प्रभातसमये राजन् कर्णस्य<BR>दैवतैः । अन्येषां चैव योधानां सा<BR>बुद्धिर् नश्यते पुनः ॥ दैवम् एव परं<BR>मन्ये यत् कर्णो हस्तसंस्थया । न<BR>जघान रणे पार्थं कृष्णं वा देवकी-<BR>सुतम् ॥ 7. 158. 6-7; also 8-9; (2) accor-<BR>ding to Vyāsa too it was due to fate<BR>(दिष्ट्या) that Arjuna was not locked in<BR>a duel with Karṇa prior to the latter's being<BR>relieved of the Śakti 7. 158. 54; according<BR>to him Ghaṭotkaca was killed by Time<BR>using Vāsavī as his means (वासवीं<BR>कारणं कृत्वा कालेनापहतो ह्य् असौ)<BR>7. 158. 58; (3) according to Kṛṣṇa he<BR>deluded the mind of Karṇa and hence he did<BR>not use his Śakti against Arjuna (अहम्<BR>एव तु राधेयं मोहयामि युधां वर<BR>7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>both fate and the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa<BR>came together to defeat the purpose of the<BR>Kauravas and hence the Vāsavī (Śakti)<BR>killed Ghaṭotkaca instead of Arjuna<BR>(दैवेनैव हता यूयं स्वबुद्ध्या<BR>केशवस्य च । गता हि वासवी हत्वा<BR>तृणभूतं घटोत्कचम्) 7. 158. 10.<BR>E. Use: (1) By Karṇa: All the Kuru<BR>warriors urged Karṇa to kill the demon<BR>Ghaṭotkaca by using the Śakti given to him<BR>by Vāsava and save the Kauravas and their<BR>warriors from destruction; hearing that call,<BR>Karṇa held the Śakti desiring to kill Ghaṭot-<BR>kaca, that Śakti given to him by Śakra<BR>and which he had preserved for Arjuna<BR>for years; when the missile was released,<BR>Ghaṭotkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form<BR>of the foot of the Vindhya mountain and<BR>fled; the beings in the mid-region wailed<BR>at the sight of the Śakti; the released Śakti<BR>first burnt the माया of Ghaṭotkaca, and<BR>then broke open deeply the chest of Ghaṭot-<BR>kaca and went up in the sky, shining at night,<BR>to enter the spaces between the नक्षत्रस्<BR>(ऊर्ध्वं ययौ दीप्यमाना निशायां<BR>नक्षत्राणाम् अन्तराण्य् आविशन्ती 7. 154. 57);<BR>Ghaṭotkaca, with his vitals pierced by the<BR>Śakti, was killed 7. 154. 48-59; 7. 156. 24;<BR>7. 158. 10; 8. 5. 71; by asking Ghaṭotkaca<BR>to fight with Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa diverted the Śakti<BR>on him 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. (5), 6, 39;<BR>7. 155. 12, 14; (Kṛṣṇa said that if<BR>Karṇa had not killed Ghaṭotkaca with his<BR>Śakti, he would have killed Ghaṭotkaca<BR>7. 156. 25); (2) By Indra: When used<BR>by Indra while fighting with the Daityas,<BR>the Śakti, after killing his enemies by hun-<BR>dreds, returned to Indra's hand 3. 294. 24;<BR>3. 286. 16 (killing of the enemies by<BR>hundreds and thousands). [See Śakti2-5]

Its use:<BR>(1) In wars or events not related to the<BR>epic: (i) when Viṣṇu was distributing the<BR>अमृत among the gods, Rāhu cunningly<BR>managed to get it; as the अमृत had<BR>reached Rāhu's throat, Viṣṇu used the Cakra<BR>to cut off his head; when severed by the<BR>Cakra, the head fell on the ground and shook<BR>the earth 1. 17. 5-7; (ii) in the war that<BR>ensued between the gods and the demons<BR>after the above incident Nara and Nārāyaṇa<BR>appeared on the scene; Viṣṇu (Narāyaṇa)<BR>then thought of his Sudarśana cakra; as soon<BR>as thought of, it arrived from the sky (ततो<BR>ऽम्बराच् चिन्तितमात्रम् आगतम् 1. 17. 20);<BR>armed with it, Viṣṇu used it against the<BR>demons; it struck them again and again and<BR>cut off the Daityas to pieces in thousands;<BR>sometimes it licked the Dānavas and, over-<BR>powering them, cut them off; sometimes it<BR>burnt them like fire; hurled now in the sky<BR>and then on the ground it drunk their blood<BR>like a Piśāca; having heard that the Sudar-<BR>śana cakra was angry, the demons disappeared<BR>entering the earth and the ocean 1. 17. 18-28;<BR>(iii) in Kṛṣṇa's war with Śālva who was<BR>fighting from his Saubhapura, Kṛṣṇa released<BR>his sharp-edged discuss, here called his dear<BR>(दयित) Āgneya astra (3. 23. 28), after<BR>reciting मन्त्रस् over it (अभिमन्त्र्य 3.<BR>23. 30) and using the strength of his arm<BR>(भुजवीर्येण 3. 23. 31); Kṛṣṇa directed<BR>his Cakra to strike down with its might the<BR>Saubha and all the enemies living there; the<BR>missile cut into two the Saubha town in the<BR>middle as a saw might cut a pillar; after<BR>achieving its objective the missile returned to<BR>Kṛṣṇa's hand; Kṛṣṇa again shook it upwards<BR>with great speed and released it with the<BR>words: “(now) for Śālva” (पुनश् चोद्-<BR>धूय वेगेन शाल्वायेत्य् अहम् अब्रुवम् 3. 23.<BR>35); the discuss instantly cut Śālva into two,<BR>who was then wielding a heavy गदा, and<BR>then it blazed with its lustre 3. 23. 28-36;<BR>(2) In wars or events related to the epic:<BR>(1) at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire, Kṛṣṇa<BR>killed many hosts of Daityas and Dānavas<BR>with his Cakra; many others, were blown<BR>away by the speed of the Cakra (चक्र-<BR>वेगेरिताः) 1. 218. 26-27; in this incident<BR>Kṛṣṇa released his Cakra on animals and<BR>other beings (तथान्या भूतजातयः 1. 219.<BR>2) so that these, along with the Dānavas and<BR>the night-stalkers (सदानवनिशाचराः 1. 219.<BR>4) were cut into pieces by hundreds and they<BR>fell into the fire; the Rākṣasas, cut by the<BR>Cakra of Kṛṣṇa, looked like evening clouds;<BR>Kṛṣṇa moved there like the god of Death kill-<BR>ing by thousands Piśācas, birds, serpents and<BR>animals with his Cakra; the Cakra, repeatedly<BR>hurled, killed many beings and returned to<BR>Kṛṣṇa's hand 1. 219. 2-7; if the Rākṣasas,<BR>Dānavas and serpents tried to escape to-<BR>gether (एकायनगताः सङ्घीभूताः Nī. on<BR>1. 228. 34 Bom. Ed.) even then Kṛṣṇa killed<BR>them and they fell into the flaming fire 1. 219.<BR>30-31; Kṛṣṇa saw Asura Maya fleeing from<BR>the house of Takṣaka and when Agni showed<BR>his desire to burn him, Kṛṣṇa stood ready with<BR>his raised Cakra to kill him; but Maya sought<BR>help from Arjuna and was saved 1. 219.<BR>35-39; (2) Enraged Kṛṣṇa cut off the head<BR>of Śiśupāla with Cakra at the time of the<BR>Rājasūya 2. 42. 21; 3. 15. 3-4; 12-13 (use<BR>of Cakra not mentioned).<BR>G. Threatened<BR>or eventual use in the epic war: (1) Dis-<BR>appointed at Arjuna's softness (मृदुयुद्ध-<BR>ताम् 6. 55. 63, 80) while fighting with Bhīṣma,<BR>Kṛṣṇa took up his discuss (रथाङ्गम्) with<BR>a view to killing Bhīṣma; raising his Cakra he<BR>jumped down from the chariot and proceeded<BR>on foot to attack Bhīṣma; the Sudarśana,<BR>lotus-like and having a beautiful nave, shone<BR>like the primeval lotus (आदिपद्म) rising<BR>from the navel of Nārāyaṇa; seeing Kṛṣṇa<BR>equipped with Cakra all beings cried aloud<BR>thinking that that was the end of the Kurus;<BR>Kṛṣṇa, holding the Cakra and jumping along,<BR>looked as if he was revolving the world, or<BR>he looked like the god of Death in the form of<BR>Fire burning the creatures (संवर्तयिष्यन्न्<BR>इव जीवलोकम् । … भूतानि धक्ष्यन्न् इव<BR>कालवह्निः) 6. 55. 92); (2) seeing Kṛṣṇa<BR>rushing towards him with Cakra in hand,<BR>Bhīṣma invited him from his chariot to put<BR>an end to his life; when Arjuna, coming<BR>from behind, assured Kṛṣṇa that he would<BR>destroy the Kurus, Kṛṣṇa returned and holding<BR>the discuss, mounted the chariot 6. 55. 83,<BR>86-87, 89-94, 100-101; (3) Apprehending<BR>that Arjuna might not be able to fulfil his vow<BR>to kill Jayadratha before sunset, Kṛṣṇa thought<BR>that his intervention in the war might become<BR>necessary and he therefore asked Dāruka, his<BR>charioteer, to keep his chariot ready with all<BR>the missiles in it, including Cakra, so that he<BR>would destroy the enemy's army with it 7.<BR>56. 32, 28. (4) Kṛṣṇa, in order to incite<BR>Arjuna who was somewhat overpowered<BR>by Karṇa, showed readiness to give his<BR>Cakra to him to cut off Karṇa's head with<BR>it 8. 65. 19.<BR>H. Actual or possible defeat<BR>of Sudarśana: (1) Viṣṇu's Cakra was<BR>shattered on the limbs of Mandara, the son<BR>of Hiraṇyakaśipu, owing to a boon Mandara<BR>had received from Mahādeva (Śiva) 13. 14.<BR>54; (2) even Kṛṣṇa with his Sudarśana<BR>would not be able to vanquish Karṇa as long<BR>as he was armed with Indra's (वासवी)<BR>Śakti and was protected by his armour and<BR>कुण्डलस् 7. 155. 17, (13-15).<BR>I. End<BR>When the end of the Yādavas had arrived and<BR>when they started for the तीर्थयात्रा on the<BR>shore of the ocean, the Cakra, given to<BR>Kṛṣṇa by Agni, left him and rose to the sky<BR>even as the Vṛṣṇis watched it 16. 4. 3; when<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira relinquished the kingdom to<BR>Parikṣit and the Pāṇḍavas started for the<BR>forest, god Agni appeared in bodily form<BR>(17. 1. 33) and told them that the excellent<BR>Cakra which stayed with Kṛṣṇa had dis-<BR>appeared and that it would return to his hand<BR>at the proper time (चक्ररत्नं तु यत्<BR>कृष्णे स्थितम् आसीन् महात्मनि । गतं तच्<BR>च पुनर् हस्ते कालेनैष्यति तस्य ह ॥ )<BR>17. 1. 38.

ṚV. 2. 12) where Gṛtsa-<BR>mada is glorified by the Brāhmaṇas (ऋग्वेदे<BR>वर्तते चाग्र्या श्रुतिर् अत्र विशां पते<BR>यत्र गृत्समदो ब्रह्मन् ब्राह्मणैः स<BR>महीयते) 13. 31. 56; a व्रत called Trisau-<BR>parṇavrata, difficult to observe, is found in<BR>the Ṛgveda (ऋग्वेदपाठपठितं व्रतम्<BR>एतद् धि दुश्चरम्) 12. 336. 20.<BR>C.<BR>Ṛgveda personified: (1) Ṛgveda, along<BR>with the Sāmaveda and the Purāṇas, move<BR>in front of the chariot of Mahādeva to<BR>protect it (when Śiva got ready to fight<BR>with the Tripuras) 8. 24. 80; (2) Ṛgveda<BR>together with the other three Vedas, visit the<BR>Sabhā of Brahmadeva (2. 11. 19) and wait<BR>on him 2. 11. 23, 31; (3) Ṛgveda, adorned<BR>with क्रम and पद, came to the sacrifice<BR>of Mahādeva (Śiva) who had assumed the<BR>form of Varuṇa 13. 85. 4, 2. [See Ṛc]

ऋच्
Ṛc f. (mostly plural): Often stands<BR>for the Ṛgveda or stanzas in it; in such<BR>contexts Ṛc often occurs along with Yajus<BR>and Sāman.<BR>A. Number: their number given as<BR>ten thousand (दशेदम् ऋक्सहस्राणि) 12.<BR>238. 14 (दश किंचिदधिकानि ऋक्सहस्राणि)<BR>Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 246. 14).<BR>B. Their<BR>study recommended and their chanting<BR>referred to: the Brāhmaṇas are enjoined to<BR>study the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and the सामन्स्<BR>(सर्वान् वेदान् अधीयीत … ऋचो यजूंषि<BR>सामानि) 12. 243. 2; 12. 260. 36; these are<BR>to be studied with due respect for the<BR>teacher; hence, while taking an oath to prove<BR>his innocence, Bharadvāja said: “who steals<BR>the lotus-stalks, may he study ऋच्स् and<BR>यजुसेस् disrespecting his teacher” (उपाध्या-<BR>यम् अधः कृत्वा ऋचो ऽध्येतु यजूंषि च ।<BR> … बिसस्तैन्यं करोति यः) 13. 95. 62; a<BR>Brāhmaṇa who can recite the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस्<BR>and sing the सामन्स् is considered to be the<BR>proper person to receive gifts (ऋग्यजुःसामगो<BR>विद्वान् … पात्रम् उच्यते) 12. 297. 15; such<BR>a learned Brāhmaṇa is to be honoured as<BR>a god (ऋग्यजुःसामविद् पूज्यो नित्यं स्याद्<BR>देववद् द्विजः) 12. 60. 42; Brāhmaṇas, ac-<BR>companying the Pāṇḍavas to the Dvaitavana,<BR>recited ऋच्स्, यजुसेस्, and सामन्स् (यजुषां<BR>ऋचां च साम्नां च … आसीद् उच्चार्यमा-<BR>णानाम् निस्वनो हृदयंगमः) 3. 27. 3;<BR>those who had studied the ऋच्स्, recited them<BR>according to the पद- and the क्रम-पाठ<BR>in the sacrificial rites performed in Kaṇva's<BR>hermitage (ऋचो बह्वृचमुख्यैश् च प्रेर्-<BR>यमाणाः पदक्रमैः । शुष्राव … विततेष्व्<BR>इह कर्मसु) 1. 64. 31; one should study<BR>त्रयी विद्या (threefold knowledge), detailed<BR>in the Vedas, from ऋच्, यजुस्, सामन्, and<BR>अथर्वन् (त्रयीविद्याम् अवेक्षेत वेदेषूक्ताम्<BR>अथाङ्गतः । ऋक्सामवर्णाक्षरतो यजुषो<BR>ऽथर्वणस् तथा) 12. 227. 1.<BR>C. Their<BR>importance for Dharmaśāstra and Adhyātma-<BR>śāstra: the शास्त्र, consisting of a hundred<BR>thousand श्लोकस्, produced by the seven<BR>sages, Marīci, Atri and others (12. 322.<BR>26-27), and which is approved by the<BR>ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स्, as well as by the<BR>अथर्वाङ्गिरसस् will be the source of<BR>धर्म (कृतं शतसहस्रं हि श्लोकानाम्<BR>इदम् उत्तमम् । … प्रवृत्तौ च निवृत्तौ च<BR>योनिर् एतद् भविष्यति । ऋग्यजुःसामभिर्<BR>जुष्टम् अथर्वाङ्गिरसैस् तथा ॥ ) 12. 322.<BR>36-37; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) identifies himself<BR>with ऋच्, सामन् and यजुस् (अहम् … ऋक्<BR>साम यजुर् एव च) 6. 31. 17; the शास्त्र<BR>constituting the secret of all the Vedas and<BR>leading to the knowledge of आत्मन् was<BR>churned out like nectar from the ten thou-<BR>sand ऋच्स् (रहस्यं सर्ववेदानां … आत्म-<BR>प्रत्ययिकं शास्त्रं … दशेदम् ऋक्सह-<BR>स्राणि निर्मथ्यामृतम् उद्धृतम्) 12. 238.<BR>13-14; there is only one सामन्, one यजुस्<BR>and one ऋच् (एकं साम यजुर् एकम् ऋग्<BR>एका) 12. 60. 45 (Nī. on 12. 60. 47 Bom.<BR>Ed. अकारो वै सर्वा वाक् … इति श्रुतेर् एकम्<BR>अकाररूपम् एव अक्षरं यथा सामादिरू-<BR>पम्).<BR>D. Their use and importance for<BR>rites (real or metaphorical): ऋच्स् and<BR>सामन्स् were chanted at the cremation<BR>rites of those fallen in the war (साम्नां<BR>ऋचां च नादेन) 11. 26. 40; those who know<BR>Nārāyaṇa recite ऋच्स् (= stanzas as holy ऋच्स् ?)<BR>to the effect that when formerly animals were<BR>bound for the god Nārāyaṇa सामन्स् were<BR>sung 14. 25. 16-17 (Nī. on 14. 25. 16<BR>Bom. Ed.: ऋचः ‘तप आसीद् गृहपतिर्’<BR>(Tai.

Ṛcs used<BR>for praising various deities: In this context<BR>ऋच् does not always mean a stanza from<BR>the Ṛgveda, but also one similar to it, or a<BR>stanza in general: (1) Excellent Brāh-<BR>maṇas praised Indra with praises consisting<BR>of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स् (स्तूयमानं<BR>द्विजाग्र्यैश् च ऋग्यजुःसामसंस्तवैः) 3.<BR>44. 18; (2) son of Ṛcīka (Śunaḥśepa),<BR>having praised with ऋच्स् gods who receive<BR>shares in sacrifices, became Viśvāmitra's<BR>son (ऋग्भिः स्तुत्वा महाभागो देवान् वै<BR>यज्ञभागिनः) 12. 281. 13; (3) various<BR>sages (Asita Devala and others 12. 281.<BR>15-16) praised Viṣṇu with ऋच्स् and obtained<BR>सिद्धि by practising तपस् due to his favour<BR>(स्तुत्वा विष्णुम् ऋग्भिः) 12. 281. 17; (4)<BR>Vyāsa, his pupils, and his son Śuka praised<BR>Hari with ऋच्स् from all the four Vedas (स<BR>चास्माकम् उपाध्यायः सहास्माभिर् विशां<BR>पते । चतुर्वेदोद्गताभिश् च ऋग्भिस् तम्<BR>अभितुष्टुवे) 12. 327. 100; Vyāsa and other<BR>sages worshipped Kṛṣṇa with praises consi-<BR>sting of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स् (ऋग्यजुः-<BR>सामसंयुक्तैर् वचोभिः कृष्णम् अर्चयन्)<BR>12. 52. 22; sages praised Madhusūdana with<BR>praises adorned with the contents of ऋच्स्<BR>(वाग्भिर् ऋग्भूषितार्थाभिः) 13. 126. 46;<BR>(5) Upamanyu, as directed by his teacher<BR>Dhaumya, praised Aśvins with the ऋच्<BR>stanzas (1. 3. 60-70 which actually are not<BR>from the Ṛgveda) to regain his eye-sight<BR>(वाग्भिर् ऋग्भिः) 1. 3. 59; (6) Śiva is<BR>praised with ऋच्स् in Tantric rites by those<BR>who are versed in the Ṛgveda (ऋग्भिर् यम्<BR>अनुशंसन्ति तन्त्रे कर्मणि बह्वृचः)<BR>(? बह्वृचाः)) 13. 16. 48; sages praised<BR>goddess Umā with praises adorned with the<BR>contents of the ऋच्स् (वाग्भिर् ऋग्भूषितार्था-<BR>भिः) 13. 128. 24.<BR>F. Their importance<BR>and utility limited: Sage Sanatsujāta told<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the छन्दस् (ऋच्), यजुस्<BR>and सामन् did not save one from sin 5. 43.<BR>1-3; the ऋच्स्, the सामन्स् and the यजुसेस्<BR>have a beginning and therefore an end i. e.<BR>they are not eternal (12. 199. 16-18); the<BR>अक्षर पद is not to be found in the ऋच्स्,<BR>यजुसेस्, अथर्वन्स्, and सामन्स् 5. 44. 21;<BR>even after studying the collections of the<BR>ऋच्स् and the सामन्स्, and the यजुसेस्<BR>Bṛhaspati did not know the source of beings<BR>(ऋक्सामसंघांश् च यजूंषि चाहम् …<BR>अधीत्य … भूतप्रकृइत्ं न वेद्मि) 12.<BR>194. 8; mortals who believed in non-<BR>distinction (between ब्रह्मन् and आत्मन्)<BR>having seen that the ऋच्स्, the सामन्स्,<BR>the यजुसेस् and the prosperity desired<BR>(through them) was something distinct (from<BR>the highest self) (resorted) to तपस् by<BR>practising austerities (अपृथग्धर्मिणो<BR>मर्त्या ऋक्सामानि यजूंषि च । काम्यां<BR>पुष्टिम् पृथग् दृष्ट्वा तपोभिस् तप एव<BR>च) 12. 224. 63 (अद्वैतनिष्ठा मर्त्यास्<BR>तप एव योगम् एव कृतयुगे ऽनुतिष्ठन्तीति<BR>शेषः । ऋगादीनि काम्या इष्टीश् च … पृथक्<BR>तपोभिर् आलोचनैः दृष्ट्वा … तत् परित्यज्य<BR>योगपरा एव बभूवुर् इत्य् अर्थः Nī. on<BR>Bom.

Abridgements: Its<BR>abridgements are referred to in 1. 1. 25<BR>(विस्तरैश् च समासैश् च धार्यते यद्<BR>द्विजातिभिः); the sage himself is credited<BR>with an abridgement of the store of know-<BR>ledge after he had first expounded it in full;<BR>learned men desire to preserve it in full as<BR>well as in abridgement (विस्तीर्यैतन् महज्<BR>ज्ञानम् ऋषिः संक्षेपम् अब्रवीत् । इष्तं हि<BR>विदुसां लोके समासव्यासधारनम्) 1. 1.<BR>49; the sage Dvaipāyana abridged (the full<BR>extent of one hundred thousand श्लोकस् into<BR>24000 श्लोकस् by omitting the उपाख्यानस्-<BR>this is known as Bhārata (चतुर्विंशतिसा-<BR>हस्रीं चक्रे भारतसंहिताम् । उपाख्या-<BR>नैर् विना तावद् भारतं प्रोच्यते बुधैः)<BR>1. 1. 61; it was further abridged into 150<BR>श्लोकस् in the form of a table of contents of all<BR>the incidents of the sub-पर्वन्स् (this could<BR>refer to 1. 2. 71-233) (ततो ऽध्यर्धशतं<BR>भूयः संक्षेपं कृतवान् ऋषिः । अनुक्रम-<BR>णिम् अध्यायं वृत्तान्तानां सपर्वणाम् 1. 1.<BR>62; एतद् अखिलम् आख्यातं भारतं पर्व-<BR>संग्रहात् 1. 2. 234); the list of the hundred<BR>sub-पर्वन्स् of the Bhārata (1. 2. 34-1. 2.<BR>70) is included in its abridgement (समासो<BR>भारतस्यायं तत्रोक्तः पर्वसंग्रहः)<BR>1. 2. 71; before narrating in all details, the<BR>Mahābhārata was first summarized by<BR>Vaiśampāyana for Janamejaya (कथितं<BR>वै समासेन त्वया सर्वं द्विजोत्तम ।<BR>महाभारतं आख्यानम्) 1. 56. 1;<BR>this summary began with the return of<BR>the Pāṇḍavas to Hāstinapura after the<BR>death of Pāṇḍu and it ended with the death<BR>of Duryodhana and the Pāṇḍavas obtaining<BR>the kingdom 1. 55. 6-42; a sort of a sum-<BR>mary which began with Pāṇḍu's conquering<BR>many countries and then retiring to the forest<BR>and ended with the great destruction after the<BR>war leaving only ten heroes alive is made by<BR>Sūta Ugraśravas for the sages assembled in<BR>the Naimiṣa forest 1. 1. 67-158.<BR>G. Three<BR>beginnings: According to Sūta Ugraśravas<BR>there were three different views regarding the<BR>beginning of the Bhārata: (1) according<BR>to one view it began with Manu Vaivasvata<BR>(मन्वादि भारतं केचित्) 1. 1. 50 (i. e.<BR>with प्रजापतेस् तु दक्षस्य मनोर् वैवस्-<BR>वतस्य च । … अन्वये ॥ यादवानाम् इमं<BR>वंशं पौरवाणां च सर्वशः । तथैव<BR>भारतानां च (?) 1. 70. 1-2); Devabodha<BR>on 1. 1. 50 explains मनुः as आदिराजः;<BR>according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 52, in<BR>the opinion of the easterners, मनु means<BR>मन्त्र and hence मन्वादि refers to the<BR>मङ्गल stanza नारायणं नमस्कृत्य etc.<BR>or ओम् नमो भगवते etc. found at the<BR>beginning of the epic in some manuscripts;<BR>in his own opinion, however, मनु refers to<BR>Manu Vaivasvata, the son of the heaven, cf.<BR>मनुर् मन्त्रः नारायणं नमस्कृत्येति ।<BR>ओम् नमो भगवते वासुदेवायेति वा तदादि<BR>इति प्रञ्चः । दिवः पुत्रो वैवस्वतमह्य-<BR>संज्ञो मनुस् तदादीति तत्त्वम् । ); (2)<BR>according to another view the Bhārata<BR>begins with आस्तीक (आस्तीकादि तथापरे)<BR>1. 1. 50 (i. e. with the अध्याय 1. 13<BR>beginning of the Āstīkaparvan); (3) accor-<BR>ding to a third view it begins with उपरिचर<BR>(तथोपरिचराद् अन्ये) 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with<BR>राजोपरिचरो नाम 1. 57. 1).<BR>H.

This was a direct proof available for a<BR>Brāhmaṇa to prove that he was not of mixed<BR>origin (निदर्शनं च प्रत्यक्षं ब्राह्-<BR>मणानां नराधिप । गायत्रीं पठते यस्<BR>तु योनिसंकरजस् तथा । गाथा वा गीतिका<BR>वापि तस्य संपद्यते नृप ॥ Nī., however,<BR>on Bom.

Its name: After its<BR>composition Brahmā destined it to be the<BR>king of all the divine स्तवस्; since then<BR>it came to be known as Stavarāja of<BR>Īśvara (सर्वस्तवानां दिव्यानां राजत्वे<BR>समकल्पयत् ॥ तदाप्रभृति चैवायम् ईश्व-<BR>रस्य महात्मनः । स्तवराजेति वीख्यातः)<BR>13. 17. 20-21.<BR>D.

Considered<BR>holy: The night in the Uttarāyaṇa is con-<BR>sidered holy and divine; Śacī bowed down<BR>to this goddess Rātri so that her wish to see<BR>her husband was fulfilled (पुण्यां चेमाम्<BR>अहं दिव्यां प्रवृत्ताम् उत्तरायणे । देवीं<BR>रात्रिम् नमस्यामि सिध्यतां मे मनोर-<BR>थः ॥ ) 5. 13. 23; from Dakṣiṇāyana (which<BR>symbolizes darkness) proceeds Uttarāyaṇa<BR>(which stands for light); (hence) the gift of<BR>light is praiseworthy (अन्धं तमस् तमि-<BR>स्रं च दक्षिणायनम् एव च । उत्तरायणम्<BR>एतस्माज् ज्योतिर्दानं प्रशस्यते ॥ ) 13. 101.<BR>46 (perhaps what is meant is that giving<BR>gifts of light helps the bringing in of the<BR>Uttarāyaṇa.

Place among the four<BR>Yugas: Fourth and the last Yuga, hence<BR>referred to as the चतुर्थ युग (युगस्य<BR>च चतुर्थस्य राजा भवति कारणम्)<BR>5. 130. 16; 12. 70. 25, or as पश्चिम<BR>युगकाल 3. 189. 13; it comes at the close<BR>of the Dvāpara Yuga (संक्षेपाद् द्वाप-<BR>रस्याथ ततः पुष्यं प्रवर्तते) 6. 11.<BR>4; hence referred to after the Dvāpara as<BR>अपर युग 12. 259. 32; Hanūmant told<BR>Bhīma that the Kaliyuga will commence<BR>soon (after the Dvāpara) (एअतत् कलियुगं<BR>नाम अचिराद् यत् प्रवर्तते) 3. 148. 37;<BR>after the Kaliyuga commences again the<BR>Kṛtayuga (क्षीणे कलियुगे चैव प्रवर्तति<BR>कृतं युगम्) 3. 186. 22.<BR>C. Duration:<BR>Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the Kali<BR>Yuga lasts for 1000 years; it is preceded by<BR>dawns of 100 years and followed by evenings<BR>of equal duration (सहस्रम् एकं वर्षाणां<BR>ततः कलियुगं स्मृतम् । तस्य वर्षशतं<BR>संध्या संध्यांशश् च ततः परम् ।<BR>संध्यासंध्यांशयोस् तुल्यं प्रमाणम्<BR>उपधारय) 3. 186. 21 (Nī. on Bom.

Events marking the advent of the Kali<BR>Yuga: (1) The armies of the Kurus and the<BR>Pāṇḍavas fought each other near the Samanta-<BR>pañcaka at the junction of the Dvāpara<BR>and the Kali Yuga (अन्तरे चैव सं-<BR>प्राप्ते कलिद्वापरयोर् अभूत् । समन्त-<BR>पञ्चके युद्धं कुरुपाण्डवसेनयोः)<BR>1. 2. 9; (2) Nārāyaṇa told Apāntaratamas<BR>that when the Tiṣyayuga will have set in the<BR>kings born in the line of Bharata, known as<BR>the Kurus, will be born of him (i. e. of Apān-<BR>taratamas then born as Vyāsa) and that<BR>there will be a feud in the family leading to<BR>mutual destruction (here Tiṣya, i. e. Kali,<BR>is mentioned in place of Dvāpara due to<BR>close proximity ?) (पुनस् तिष्ये च संप्रा-<BR>प्ते कुरवो नाम भारताः । भविष्यन्ति<BR>महात्मानो राजानः प्रथिता भुवि ॥ तेषां<BR>त्वत्तः प्रसूतानां कुलभेदो भविष्यति ।<BR>परस्परविनाशार्थं) 12. 337. 42-43;<BR>(3) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that at the end<BR>of the junction of the Dvāpara and the<BR>Kali age he would appear in Mathurā for<BR>the killing of Kaṃsa (द्वापरस्य कलेश्<BR>चैव संधौ पर्यवसानिके । प्रादुर्भा-<BR>वः कंसहेतोः मथुरायां भविष्यति)<BR>12. 326. 82; (4) at the end of the Dvā-<BR>para and the beginning of the Kali age<BR>Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa), along with Saṃkarṣaṇa,<BR>is sung according to the Sātvata mode of<BR>worship (द्वापरस्य युगस्यान्ते आदौ<BR>कलियुगस्य च । सात्वतं विधिस्म् आस्थाय<BR>गीतः संकर्षणेन यः) 6. 62. 39.<BR>E.<BR>Kaliyuga and Nārāyaṇa and Vyāsa: (1)<BR>Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in the Kali<BR>Yuga Kṛṣṇa came down to the earth as<BR>अधर्म (कृष्णः । कलाव् अधर्मः क्षितिम्<BR>आजगाम 13. 143. 9; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13.<BR>158. 10: कलौ त्व् अधर्म एव बलवान् इति<BR>भावः); the god (Nārāyaṇa i. e. Kṛṣṇa-<BR>Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya<BR>that he has dark colour in the Kaliyuga<BR>(कृष्णः कलियुगे तथा) 3. 187. 31;<BR>तामसं युगम् आसाद्य कृष्णो भवति<BR>केशवः) 3. 148. 33; (2) Hari-Nārāyaṇa<BR>told Apāntaratamas (12. 337. 38) that when<BR>Kṛṣṇayuga (i. e. Kaliyuga) sets in he (as<BR>Vyāsa) will have dark colour (कृष्णे युगे<BR>च संप्राप्ते कृष्णवर्णो भविष्यसि) 12.<BR>337. 44.<BR>F. King and the Kali Yuga:<BR>All the Yugas are dependent on the king's<BR>behaviour, hence a king is called a युग<BR>(राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव युगम् उच्यते)<BR>12. 92. 6; according to Bhīṣma all the<BR>Yugas, including Kali, are rooted in a king<BR>(राजमूलानि सर्वाणि) 12. 139. 10; it is the<BR>king who makes the Yugas what they are and<BR>hence he is also the cause of the fourth Yuga<BR>(i. e. the Kaliyuga) (युगस्य च चतुर्थ-<BR>स्य राजा भवति कारणम्) 5. 130. 16; 12.<BR>70. 25; by bringing about the Kali age the<BR>king incurs immense sin (कलेः प्रवर्तनाद्<BR>राजा पापम् अत्यन्तम् अश्नुते) 12. 70. 27;<BR>by bringing about the Kaliyuga (not directly<BR>stated) the evil-doer (i. e. the king) lives<BR>eternally in the hell (ततो वसति दुष्कर्मा<BR>नरके शाश्वतीः समाः) 5. 130. 18; when<BR>the king wholly gives up दण्डनीति and<BR>oppresses his subjects unjustly the Kali age<BR>makes its appearance (दण्डनीतिं परित्य-<BR>ज्य यदा कार्त्स्न्येन भूमिपः । प्रजाः<BR>क्लिश्नात्य् अयोगेन प्रविश्यति तदा कलिः)<BR>12. 70. 18; where the sinful ones move about<BR>freely among the righteous, there the Kali<BR>age (? or the evil spirit ?) meets the kings<BR>(? यत्र पापा ज्ञायमानाश् चरन्ति सतां<BR>कलिर् विन्दति तत्र राज्ञाः) 12. 92. 27<BR>(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 91. 28: राज्ञः<BR>नृपान्).<BR>G. Kali Yuga and धर्म:<BR>While describing the four Yugas Hanūmant<BR>told Bhīma that in the Kali Yuga धर्म<BR>stands only on one foot (पादेनैकेन<BR>कौन्तेय धर्मः कलियुगे स्थितः) 3.<BR>148. 32; (पादेन त्व् अपरे (i. e. कलौ)<BR>युगे) 12. 259. 32; (ततस् तिष्ये ऽथ सं-<BR>प्राप्ते युगे कलिपुरस्कृते । एकपाद-<BR>स्थितो धर्मो यत्र तत्र भविष्यति) 12.<BR>327. 76 (however, commentator Vādirāja:<BR>तिष्ये पुष्यनक्षत्रे, note on this stanza in<BR>the Cr.

Nature of the Kali Yuga<BR>and its effects on men: Vedic practices dwin-<BR>dle, so also the religious and the sacrificial<BR>rites; on the other hand, seasonal calamities,<BR>diseases, lassitude, vices like anger and<BR>others, calamities and mental agonies are ex-<BR>perienced (वेदाचाराः प्रशाम्यन्ति धर्म-<BR>यज्ञक्रियास् तथा ॥ ईतयो व्याधयस्<BR>तन्द्री दोषाः क्रोधादयस् तथा । उपद्रवाश्<BR>च वर्तन्ते आधयो व्याधयस् तथा ॥ 3.<BR>148. 33-34; also cf. 3. 186. 24-55; 3. 188.<BR>5-6, 13-84; 12. 224. 62; in the Kali Yuga<BR>the Vedas are seen (i. e. practised) by some<BR>and not by others; they, which alone serve as<BR>dams of धर्म, fall into ruin along with<BR>the sacrifices (दृश्यन्ते नापि दृश्यन्ते वेदाः<BR>कलियुगे ऽखिलाः । उत्सीदन्ते सयज्ञाश् च<BR>केवला धर्मसेतवः ॥ ) 12. 224. 66; 12.<BR>230. 15-17; the study of the Vedas dwindles<BR>gradually in each succeeding Yuga (वेद-<BR>वादाश् चानुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति च नः श्रुतम्)<BR>12. 224. 25; the अधर्म in the Yugas<BR>other than the Kṛta is on increase due to the<BR>practice of theft, falsehood and deceipt 12.<BR>224. 23; the duties (धर्माः) to be followed<BR>in the Kali Yuga are different (from those of<BR>the other Yugas); they have been prescribed<BR>as if keeping in mind the (lowered) capacity<BR>of men in that age (अन्ये कलियुगे धर्मा<BR>यथाशक्तिकृता इव) 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;<BR>giving gifts is specially recommended for the<BR>Kali Yuga (दानम् एव कलौ युगे) 12.<BR>224. 27; in the Kali age अधर्म is practised<BR>by many, and धर्म only by a few; all<BR>the Varṇas are disinclined to follow धर्म<BR>proper to them 12. 70. 19; also 20-24; the<BR>nature of men in the Puṣyayuga is describ-<BR>ed also in 6. 11. 12-13; strict adherence<BR>to धर्म is not to be expected in the Kali<BR>Yuga-this is what Kṛṣṇa implied in his<BR>words addressed to Balarāma to assuage his<BR>wrath (प्राप्तं कलियुगं विद्धि) 9. 59.<BR>21; in the Kali age (as in the Dvāpara) it<BR>is necessary for people to he paired to beget<BR>children (द्वापरे मैथुनो धर्मः प्रजा-<BR>नाम् अभवन् नृप । तथा कलियुगे राजन्<BR>द्वन्द्वम् आपेदिरे जनाः ॥ ) 12. 200. 37;<BR>the ascetics born in the Kali age (as also in<BR>the Tretā and the Dvāpara) are beset with<BR>doubts (त्रेतायां द्वापरे चैव कलिजाश् च<BR>ससंशयाः । तपस्विनः) 12. 230. 7; evil<BR>tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas and<BR>others which originate in the south (दक्षिणा-<BR>पथजन्मानः) and those like the Yaunas,<BR>the Kāmbojas, and other which have their<BR>origin in the north (उत्तरापथजन्मानः)<BR>roam on the earth in the Tretā and the follow-<BR>ing Yugas (i. e. also in the Kali) (त्रेता-<BR>प्रभृति वर्तन्ते ते जना भरतर्षभ)<BR>12. 200. 39-42; Dyumatsena told Satyavān<BR>that if the Dasyus were not killed then<BR>in the Kaliyuga people would say to each<BR>other: “this is mine, not his”, it would<BR>then be difficult to carry on every day life<BR>(ममेदम् इति नास्यैतत् प्रवर्तेत कलौ<BR>युगे । लोकयात्रा न चैव स्यात्) 12. 259. 6; if<BR>one always recites the description of the origin<BR>of cows he is freed of the impurity of the Kali<BR>age (? or of evil spirit ?) (इमं गवां प्र-<BR>भवविधानम् उत्तमं पठन् सदा …<BR>विमुच्यते कलिकलुषेण मानवः) 13. 76. 32.<BR>I. Span of life: In the Puṣya (i. e. the Kali)<BR>Yuga there is no fixed span of life; people die<BR>(even) in the womb or immediately after<BR>they are born (न प्रमाणस्थितिर् ह्य् अस्ति<BR>पुष्ये ऽस्मिन् भरतर्षभ गर्भस्थाश् च<BR>म्रियन्ते ऽत्र तथा जाता म्रियन्ति च ॥ )<BR>6. 11. 7; the life-span, as also other faculties,<BR>of human beings decrease successively in<BR>each following Yuga (आयुर् वीर्यम् … ।<BR>मनुस्याणाम् अनुयुगं ह्रसतीति निबोध<BR>मे ॥ ) 3. 188. 13; however, life is expected<BR>to be of a hundred years ( … त्रेतादिष्व् एते-<BR>सां पादशो ह्रसते वयः) 12. 224. 24, 25.<BR>J. Kali as a name of Sūrya: Kali occurs<BR>among the 108 names of Sūrya taught by<BR>Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22 (Nī. on<BR>Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 20: कलिः सर्वमलाश्रय<BR>इत्य् एकं नाम).

(9) Lomaśa told Yudhiṣṭhira that<BR>formerly in the Devayuga he had seen that<BR>the gods liked the धर्म and the Asuras<BR>deserted it (पुरा देवयुगे चैव दृष्टं<BR>सर्वं मया विभो । अरोचयन् सुरा धर्-<BR>मं धर्मं तत्यजिरे ऽसुराः) 3. 92. 6;<BR>(10) Gods and demons churned the ocean<BR>in the Ādiyuga 6. 76. 18;

(14)<BR>God Nārāyaṇa told the seven sages (12. 322.<BR>27, 31) that the अनुशासन promulgated by<BR>him and the शास्त्र, together with the अङ्गस्<BR>and the Upaniṣad, will be established by<BR>them in Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa in the Kṛta Yuga<BR>(not directly named) (उत्पन्ने ऽङ्गिरसे चैव<BR>युगे प्रथमकल्पिते । साङ्गोपनिषदं<BR>शास्त्रं स्थापयित्वा बृहस्पतौ) 12. 322.<BR>51; (15) In the Kṛta there was a famous<BR>sage Taṇḍi who, as a devotee, propitiated<BR>god for ten thousand years by practising<BR>समाधि 13. 16. 12; (16) Formerly in the<BR>the Kṛta Yuga an excellent Brāhmaṇa called<BR>Ārṣṭiṣeṇa lived in a गुरुकुल; he studied<BR>diligently, but could not complete the study<BR>of either the विद्यास् or the Vedas (पुरा<BR>कृतयुगे … ) 9. 39. 3-4; (17) Formerly in<BR>the Kṛta Yuga there lived a king Avikam-<BR>paka who was overpowered in battle by<BR>enemies (पुरा कृतयुगे तात … ) 12. 248. 7;<BR>(18) In the Kṛta Yuga there was a famous<BR>sage Sāvarṇi who practised austerities for<BR>six thousand years to satisfy Rudra 13.<BR>14. 70; (19) Formerly in the Kṛta<BR>Yuga there was a sage Vyāghrapāda who<BR>was versed in the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas<BR>(पुरा कृतयुगे तात … ) 13. 14. 75;<BR>(20) In the Dharmayuga, when Janaka<BR>ruled Mithilā, a certain भिक्षुकी called<BR>Sulabhā roamed alone on the earth 12. 308.<BR>7; (21) In the Prājāpatyayuga (i. e. the<BR>Kṛtayuga) there once lived a large camel<BR>who remembered his previous lives (जातिस्-<BR>मरः); he observed scrupulously the vows<BR>and practised severe austerities in a forest<BR>12. 113. 4; (22) Formerly in the Kṛta<BR>Yuga a Rākṣasa called Cārvāka practised<BR>austerities in the Badarī Āśrama and was<BR>blessed with a boon by Brahman (पुरा<BR>कृतयुगे … ) 12. 39. 39; (23) Nārāyaṇa<BR>told Nārada that formerly in the Kṛta Yuga<BR>when the Veda and the श्रुति were lost, he<BR>retrieved them and (the worlds) were again<BR>supplied with the Vedas and the श्रुतिस् (?)<BR>(यदा वेदश्रुतिर् नष्टा मया प्रत्याहृता<BR>पुरा । सवेदाः सश्रुतीकाश् च कृताः पूर्वं<BR>कृते युगे ॥ ) 12. 326. 94; (24) Formerly,<BR>during the second birth of Brahmā from the<BR>eyes of Nārāyaṇa in the Kṛta Yuga, Rudra,<BR>who received the धर्म of the Ekāntins<BR>from Soma and who practised योग, taught<BR>it to the Vālakhilyas ( … पुरा कृतयुगे<BR>नृप) 12. 336. 15-16; the practice of the<BR>धर्म of the Ekāntins formed such an<BR>important characteristic of the Kṛta Yuga<BR>that if in any other Yuga the world became<BR>full of the Ekāntins that would mean the<BR>advent of the Kṛta Yuga—this is what<BR>Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya (यद्य् एकान्-<BR>तिभिर् आकीर्णं जगत् स्यात् कुरुनन्दन ।<BR> … भवेत् कृतयुगप्राप्तिः) 12. 336. 58;<BR>(25) Hari-Nārāyaṇa told Brahmā, born<BR>for the fourth time from his ears (12. 336.<BR>23), to learn the Sātvata Dharma, from<BR>him and establish it in the Kṛta Yuga<BR>12. 336. 27; this धर्म was hence called<BR>Kārtayugadharman 12. 336. 29; Brahmā, as<BR>instructed by Nārāyaṇa, initiated first the<BR>Kṛta Yuga and then the Sātvata धर्म<BR>spread among the people 12. 336. 31; (26)<BR>In the fifth birth of Brahman from the nose<BR>of Nārāyaṇa (12. 336. 36), at the beginning<BR>of the Kṛtayuga, Prajāpati Vīraṇa learnt the<BR>Sātvata Dharma from Sanatkumāra 12. 336.<BR>37; (27) In the seventh birth of Brahman<BR>from a lotus (12. 336. 44), Nārāyaṇa him-<BR>self instructed Pitāmaba in the Sātvata<BR>धर्म at the beginning of the Kṛta Yuga<BR>(not named) तत्रैष धर्मः कथितः<BR>स्वयं नारायणेन हि ॥ पितामहाय शुद्-<BR>धाय युगादौ लोकधारिणे) 12. 336.<BR>44-45; (28) At the request of Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>Bhīṣma told him how at the beginning,<BR>in the Kṛta Yuga, a kingdom first came<BR>into existence (यथा राज्यं समुत्पन्-<BR>नम् आदौ कृतयुगे ऽभवत्) 12. 59. 13;<BR>(29) Formerly in the Kṛta Yuga the ascetics<BR>residing in the Naimiṣa forest were engaged<BR>in a twelve-yearly sacrificial session (पूर्वं<BR>कृतयुगे राजन् … ) 9. 36. 39.<BR>F. Nārāyaṇa<BR>(Kṛṣṇa) and the Kṛta Yuga: Bhagavān<BR>Nārāyaṇa (who was the same as Kṛṣṇa-<BR>Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya<BR>that his colour in the Kṛta Yuga was white<BR>(श्वेतः कृतयुगे वर्णः) 3. 187. 31; Bhīṣma<BR>told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was complete<BR>Dharma in the Kṛta Yuga (कृते युगे धर्म<BR>आसीत् समग्रः) 13. 143. 9.<BR>G. King and<BR>the Kṛta Yuga: The king is the creator of<BR>the Kṛta Yuga (राजा कृतयुगस्रष्टा) 5.<BR>130. 16 = 12. 70. 25, (also cf. राजा कालस्य<BR>कारणम् 12. 70. 6); Kṛta and the remaining<BR>three Yugas depend on the conduct of the<BR>king and hence the king is identical with<BR>Yuga (राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव युगम्<BR>उच्यते) 12. 92. 6; (राजमूलानि सर्वाणि)<BR>12. 139. 10; when the king fully followed<BR>दण्डनीति then prevailed the Kṛta Yuga, the<BR>best of time (दण्डनीत्यां यदा राजा सम्यक्<BR>कार्त्स्न्येन वर्तते । तदा कृतयुगं नाम<BR>कालः श्रेष्ठः प्रवर्तते ॥ ) 5. 130. 14 =<BR>12. 70. 7; Dyumatsena told Satyavān that in<BR>the Kṛta Yuga the king followed the instruc-<BR>tion (how a king should rule 12. 259. 24-30)<BR>as his primary principle (एतत् प्रथम-<BR>कल्पेन राजा कृतयुगे ऽभजत्) 12. 259. 32;<BR>a king, as the creator of Kṛta, enjoyed in<BR>the heaven endlessly (कृतस्य करणाद् राजा<BR>स्वर्गम् अत्यन्तम् अश्नुते) 5. 130. 17 =<BR>12. 70. 26; king Yayāti was described by<BR>Aṣṭaka as the best among those born in the<BR>Kṛta Yuga (कार्तयुगप्रधान) 1. 85. 1<BR>(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 90. 1: कार्तयुगप्र-<BR>धान । कृतयुगे भवाः कार्तयुगाः॑अत्य-<BR>न्तनिष्पापा तेषां मुख्यतमेत्य् अर्थः).<BR>H. Kṛta and धर्म: In the Kṛta Yuga<BR>the ancient धर्म prevails (यत्र धर्मः<BR>सनातनः) 3. 148. 10; in that Yuga the eternal<BR>धर्म of the four वर्णस् stands on all its<BR>four feet (i. e. is in no way deficient) (कृते<BR>युगे चतुष्पादश् चातुर्वर्ण्यस्य शाश्वतः)<BR>3. 148. 21; formerly in the Kṛta Yuga Dharma,<BR>the bull, without deceit and free from vices<BR>stood established in its entirety among men<BR>(कृते चतुष्पात् सकलो निर्व्याजोपाधिवर्-<BR>जितः । वृषः प्रतिष्ठितो धर्मो मनुष्येष्व्<BR>अभवत् पुरा ॥ ) 3. 188. 10 (Nī. on 3.<BR>190. 9: वृष इव चतुष्पात्); 12. 327. 73;<BR>both धर्म, on its four feet, and truth<BR>are fully established in the Kṛta Yuga<BR>(चतुष्पात् सकलो धर्मः सत्यं चैव<BR>कृते युगे) 12. 224. 22; since धर्म is not<BR>contaminated by अधर्म (नाधर्मेणा-<BR>गमः कश्चित् 12. 224. 22) it does not get<BR>diminished (धर्मो न ह्रसते क्वचित्) 1.<BR>58. 22; धर्म always prospers and अधर्म<BR>is destroyed 3. 189. 7; 12. 70. 8; धर्म<BR>in the Kṛta Yuga was established among<BR>the Brāhmaṇas who had mastered their self,<BR>who had practised austerities and who had<BR>studied the Vedas (आत्मवत्सु तपोवत्सु<BR>श्रुतवैसु प्रतिष्ठितः) 12. 224. 67; धर्म<BR>in different Yugas is different 12. 224. 26 =<BR>12. 252. 8; austerity is the best धर्म<BR>for the Kṛta (तपः परं कृतयुगे) 12.<BR>24. 27; in the Kṛta Yuga the only धर्म<BR>is renunciation (धर्मः संन्यास एव<BR>च) 3. 148. 13; one is not supposed to<BR>get angry in the Kṛta Yuga (न रोषं<BR>कर्तुम् अर्हसि । नैष धर्मः कृतयुगे<BR>यस् त्वं रोषम् अचीकृथाः) 12. 323. 17.<BR>I. Kṛta and the sacrifice: In the Kṛta<BR>Yuga performance of sacrifices is not pre-<BR>scribed (त्रेतायुगे विधिस् त्व् एषां यज्ञा-<BR>नां न कृते युगे) 12. 224. 62; the sages<BR>who assembled for a sacrifice told gods who<BR>wanted a goat to be killed that that was<BR>not the धर्म of good people; they reminded<BR>the gods that they were in the Kṛta Yuga<BR>when an animal was not offered (नैष<BR>धर्मः सतां देवा यत्र वध्येत वै<BR>पशुः । इदं कृतयुगं श्रेष्ठं कथं<BR>वध्येत वै पशुः ॥ ) 12. 324. 5; (अहिंस्या<BR>यज्ञपशवो युगे ऽस्मिन् नैतद् अन्यथा) 12.<BR>327. 73; the offerings offered by Brahman and<BR>others to Viṣṇu in a Vaiṣṇava Kratu were<BR>offered according to the prescriptions meant<BR>for the Kṛta Yuga and, as a result, they reach-<BR>ed the Puruṣa who had the brightness of the<BR>sun and who was above darkness (ते कार्त-<BR>युगधर्माणो भागा परमसत्कृताः ।<BR>प्रापुर् आदित्यवर्णं तं पुरुषं तमसः<BR>परम् ॥ ) 12. 327. 50 (commentator Vidyā-<BR>sāgara: कार्तयुगधर्माणः अहिंसादि-<BR>लक्षणकृतस्वभावाः मन्त्रलोपतन्त्रलोप-<BR>क्रियालोपहिंसादिरहिताः परमसंस्कृताः,<BR>cf. the note on this stanza in the Cr.

Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya<BR>told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of the<BR>Tretā Yuga was three thousand years, with<BR>dawns of three hundred years and twilights<BR>of the same duration (त्रीणि वर्षसहस्राणि<BR>त्रेतायुगम् इहोच्यते । तस्य तावच्छती<BR>संध्या संध्यांशस् च ततः परम् ॥ …<BR>संध्यासंध्यांशयोस् तुल्यं प्रमाणम्<BR>उपधारय) 3. 186. 19, 21 (for Nī.'s ex-<BR>planation of संध्या and संध्यांश, see<BR>Kali, Section C); the same duration was<BR>told by Vyāsa to Śuka without specifically<BR>naming the Yuga but in relation to Kṛta<BR>(इतरेषु ससंध्येषु ससंध्यांशेषु च<BR>त्रिषु । एकापायेन संयान्ति सहस्राणि शतानि<BR>च ॥ ) 12. 224. 20.<BR>C. Events: (1)<BR>Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that in<BR>the Tretāyuga, (first), he will be born as<BR>Rāma in the family of the Bhṛgus and will<BR>destroy the Kṣatriyas; and, (next), when the<BR>junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara will<BR>have arrived he will be born as Rāma, son<BR>of Daśaratha, to be the king of the world<BR>(त्रेतायुगे भविष्यामि रामो भृगुकुलोद्-<BR>वहः । क्षत्रं चोत्सादयिष्यामि … ॥ सं-<BR>धौ तु समनुप्राप्ते त्रेतायां द्वापर्-<BR>अस्य च । रामो दाशर्थिर् भूत्वा भवि-<BR>ष्यामि जगत्पतिः ॥ ) 12. 326. 77-78; 1. 2. 3;<BR>(2) A being without bodily form informed<BR>from the sky (12. 323. 46) Ekata, Dvita<BR>and Trita that when the Kṛtayuga had passed<BR>and the Tretāyuga of the 7th मन्वन्तर<BR>presided over by Manu Vaivasvata will have<BR>arrived they will work as helpers of gods<BR>for achieving a great purpose (वैवस्वते<BR>ऽन्तरे विप्राः प्राप्ते त्रेतायुगे ततः ।<BR>सुराणां कार्यसिद्ध्यर्थं सहाया वै<BR>भविष्यथ) 12. 323. 51; (cf. 12. 326. 79-<BR>80); (3) Vyāsa told Yudhiṣṭhira that<BR>Karaṃdhama's son (Avikṣit) was born at<BR>the commencement of the Tretāyuga—he<BR>was glorious, not inferior to Indra, and invin-<BR>cible even by the gods 14. 4. 17; (4) Bhīṣma<BR>told Yudhiṣṭhira that formerly at the junction<BR>of the Tretā and the Dvāpara, a terrible<BR>drought, lasting for twelve years, occurred<BR>due to the working of the fate (दैवविधि-<BR>क्रमात्) 12. 139. 13; when the Tretā was<BR>about to end and the Dvāpara was about<BR>to set in and when the end of the eon was at<BR>hand Indra did not release rain (युगान्ते पर्-<BR>युपस्थिते । त्रेतानिर्मोक्षसमये द्वापर-<BR>प्रतिपादने ॥ न ववर्ष सहस्राक्षः)<BR>12. 139. 14-15.<BR>D. Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa and<BR>Tretā: Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārka-<BR>ṇḍeya that his colour in the Tretāyuga was<BR>yellow (पीतस् त्रेतायुगे मम) 3. 187. 31;<BR>but according to Hanūmant, Acyuta was<BR>red in the Tretā (रक्ततां याति चाच्युतः)<BR>3. 148. 23; Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that<BR>Kṛṣṇa conformed to ज्ञान in the Tretā<BR>(त्रेताकाले ज्ञानम् अनुप्रपन्नः) 13. 143.<BR>9 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 158. 10: ज्ञानम्<BR>अकर्तव्यकोटेर् अपि उपस्थानात् त्रेतायां<BR>विवेक आसीत्).<BR>E. King and Tretā: When<BR>the king observes दण्डनीति only in three<BR>parts and leaves out the fourth, the Tretā-<BR>yuga sets in; the place of the fourth part is<BR>then made up by what is inauspicious and this<BR>part gets associated with the other three,<BR>hence the earth has to be ploughed for the<BR>growth of the plants (दण्डनीत्या यदा राजा<BR>त्रीन् अंशान् अनुवर्तते । चतुर्थम् अंशम्<BR>उत्सृज्य तदा त्रेता प्रवर्तते ॥ अशुभस्य<BR>चतुर्थांशस् त्रीन् अंशान् अनुवर्तते । कृष्ट-<BR>पच्यैव पृथिवी भवन्त्योषध्यस् तथा ॥ )<BR>12. 70. 14-15; (पादोनेनापि धर्मेण गच्-<BR>छेत् त्रेतायुगे तथा) 12. 259. 32; a king is<BR>the cause of the Tretā (as also of the other<BR>three Yugas) (त्रेतायाः … । … राजा भवति<BR>कारणम्) 5. 130. 16 = 12. 70. 25; (also cf.<BR>राजा कालस्य कारणम् 12. 70. 6 = 5. 130. 15);<BR>Tretā, like the other three Yugas, depends<BR>on the conduct of the king and hence the<BR>king is called a Yuga (राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि<BR>राजैव युगम् उच्यते) 12. 92. 6; (राज-<BR>मूलानि सर्वाणि) 12. 139. 10; a king obtains<BR>heaven, but not endlessly, because he intro-<BR>duces Tretā (त्रेतायाः करणाद् राजा स्वर्गं<BR>नात्यन्तम् अश्नुते) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70. 26;<BR>description of the people in the Tretā in the<BR>absence of दण्डनीति 12. 65. 24-27;<BR>F. Tretā and धर्म: In the Tretāyuga<BR>Dharma loses one of its four feet (तत्र<BR>(i. e. त्रेतायुगे) पादचतुर्थो वै धर्म्-<BR>अस्य न भविष्यति) 12. 327. 74; (पादेन<BR>ह्रसते धर्मः) 3. 148. 22-23; in the<BR>Tretā, Dharma is established in three parts<BR>and the remaining one part is affected by<BR>अधर्म (अधर्मपादविद्धस् तु त्रिभिर्<BR>अंशैः प्रतिष्ठितः । त्रेतायाम्) 3. 188. 11;<BR>also of 12. 259. 32; in the Tretā and the<BR>other two following Yugas the धर्म is<BR>displaced from tradition successively by one<BR>quarter and the अधर्म is on increase due<BR>to thefts, falsehood and deceit (इतरेष्व्<BR>(i. e. युगेषु) आगमाद् धर्मः पादशस्<BR>त्व् अवरोप्यते । चौरिकानृतमायाभिर्<BR>अधर्मश् चोपचीयते) 12. 224. 23; the<BR>धर्मस् in the Tretā were different from<BR>those in the Kṛta 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;<BR>ज्ञान was considered to be the best धर्म<BR>for the Tretā (त्रेतायां ज्ञानम् उत्तमम्)<BR>12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that times<BR>in the different Yugas were different 3. 148.<BR>6; Vyāsa told his son Śuka that he had<BR>heard that the study of the Vedas decreased<BR>in every following Yuga and so also the<BR>benefit derived by people from the Veda<BR>(वेदवादाश् चानुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति च नः<BR>श्रुतम् । … वेदस्यैव च यत् फलम्) 12.<BR>224. 25; the Sātvata धर्म, which flourished<BR>in the Kṛtayuga of the fourth birth of Brah-<BR>man (12. 336. 25), disappeared when the<BR>Tretā returned (ततः सो ऽन्तर्दधे भूयः<BR>प्राप्ते त्रेतायुगे पुनः) 12. 336. 35; but<BR>in the seventh birth of Brahman (12. 336.<BR>44) the same Sātvata धर्म was taught<BR>by Vivasvān to Manu 12. 326. 47; according<BR>to Mārkaṇḍeya, however, the धर्म for<BR>the Kṛta, the Tretā and the Dvāpara was<BR>the same 3. 189. 13.<BR>G. Tretā and the<BR>sacrifice: There were no sacrifices in the<BR>Kṛtayuga, but they all, very strong, collected<BR>together appeared in the Tretā and be-<BR>came controllers of those that move (living<BR>beings) and those that do not (non-living<BR>beings) (त्रेतायुगे विधिस् त्व् एषां यज्ञानां<BR>न कृते युगे … त्रेतायां तु समस्तास् ते<BR>प्रादुरासन् महाबलाः । संयन्तारः<BR>स्थावराणां जङ्गमानां च सर्वशः ॥<BR>त्रेतायां संहता ह्य् एते यज्ञाः … ) 12.<BR>224. 62, 64, 65 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed.<BR>12. 232. 34: त्रेतायां धर्मे नृणां स्वतः<BR>प्रवृत्त्यभावात् तत्र संयन्तारो धर्म-<BR>शास्तारो वेदाश् च संहता यज्ञाद्यनुष्ठा-<BR>पनाय सन्नद्धा आसन्); Bhagavān (Nārā-<BR>yana) told the gods that the three Vedas<BR>will rule the Tretāyuga and then the animals,<BR>consecrated for the sacrifice, will be killed<BR>(ततस् त्रेतायुगं नाम त्रयी यत्र भवि-<BR>ष्यति । प्रोक्षिता यत्र पशव वधं<BR>प्राप्स्यन्ति वै मखे । ) 12. 327. 74;<BR>(त्रेताम् अपि निबोध त्वम् यस्मिन् सत्रं<BR>प्रवर्तते) 3. 148. 22; (ततो यज्ञाः प्र-<BR>वर्तन्ते धर्माश् च विविधाः क्रियाः ।<BR>त्रेतायां भावसंकल्पाः क्रियादानफलो-<BR>दयाः ॥ ) 3. 148. 24 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3.<BR>149. 23: सत्रं यज्ञक्रिया रजोमिश्रत्वात्;<BR>on 3. 149. 25: भावसंकल्पाः भावो<BR>भावना क्रिया अहम् अनेन कर्मणा<BR>इदं फलं अनेन प्रकारेण करिष्यामीत्य्<BR>एवंरूपा तद्विषय एव संकल्पो येषाम्);<BR>Vyāsa told Śuka that at the commencement<BR>of the Tretā the Vedas and the sacrifices<BR>are complete in form (त्रेतादौ सकला वेदा<BR>यज्ञा वर्णाश्रामास् तथा) 12. 230. 14;<BR>(also cf. Maheśvara (Viṣṇu) recommending<BR>the performance of sacrifices for the benefit of<BR>gods, and the gods, on their part, sustaining<BR>the worlds in the Yugas (not named) other<BR>than the Kṛta 12. 327. 53-60).<BR>H. Nature<BR>of the Tretāyuga: Hanūmant told Bhīma<BR>that the times in the Tretā were different from<BR>those in the Kṛta (अन्यः कृतयुगे कालस्<BR>त्रेतायां द्वापरे ऽपरः) 3. 148. 6; Hanū-<BR>mant then described to Bhīma the condition<BR>of the world in the Tretāyuga 3. 148. 22-25<BR>(men are truthful (सत्यप्रवऋत्ताश् च नराः),<BR>they do not deviate from the path of धर्म,<BR>are given to the practice of austerities and to<BR>giving gifts); the Tretāyuga also described<BR>by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Kṣatriyas are<BR>long-lived, they are great warriors, excellent<BR>archers in war, brave and emperors) 6. 11. 10<BR>(जायन्ते क्षत्रियाः शूरास् त्रेतायां चक्र-<BR>वर्तिनः); according to Mārkaṇḍeya the<BR>condition of धर्म in the Tretā is not<BR>different from the one in the Kṛta described<BR>by him (एष धर्मः कृतयुगे त्रेआयाम्)<BR>3. 189 13; the ascetics in the Tretā, who<BR>are steady in the सत्त्व गुण, have no<BR>doubt whatever whether पुरुष, दैव<BR>or स्वभाव is the cause of a man's success<BR>in his activities; they see no distinction,<BR>as same people for want of judgement do,<BR>between them (पौरुषं कारणं केचिद्<BR>आहुः कर्मसु मानवाः । दविअम् एके<BR>प्रशंसन्ति स्वभावं चापरे जनाः ॥ …<BR>त्रयम् एतत् पृथग्भूतम् अविवेकं तु<BR>केचन । … कर्मस्था विषमं ब्रूयुः<BR>सत्त्वस्थाः समदर्शिनः ॥ त्रेतायां …<BR>तपस्विनः … ) 12. 230. 4, 6-7; in the Tretā,<BR>as in the Kṛta, people could get progeny by<BR>mere thought and did not have to cohabit<BR>for this purpose (तत्र त्रेतायुगे काले सं-<BR>कल्पाज् जायते प्रजा । न ह्य् अभूत् मैथुनो<BR>धर्मस् तेषाम् अपि नराधिप ॥ ) 12. 200.<BR>36; evil tribes like the Talavaras, the<BR>Andhrakas and others in the south and the<BR>Yaunas (Yavanas), the Kāmbojas and others<BR>in the north, unlike in the Kṛtayuga, begin<BR>to roam about on the surface of the<BR>earth from the Tretāyuga onwards (नैते<BR>कृतयुगे तात चरन्ति पृथिवीम् इमाम् ।<BR>त्रेताप्रभृति वर्तन्ते ते जना भरतर्-<BR>षभ ॥ ) 12. 200. 42.<BR>I. Span of life:<BR>Vyāsa told Śuka that people in each suc-<BR>ceeding Yuga lived a quarter years less<BR>than those in the Kṛtayuga who lived for<BR>four hundred years, i. e. in the Tretā they<BR>lived for three hundred years (चतुर्वर्ष-<BR>शतायुषः । कृते त्रेतादिष्व् एतेषां पादशो<BR>ह्रसते वयः) 12. 224. 24; Vyāsa had heard<BR>that life gradually decreased in each succes-<BR>sive Yuga (अनुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति च नः<BR>श्रुतम् । आयूंषि) 12. 224. 25; the same<BR>thing was told by Mārkaṇḍeya to Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira (आयुर् वीर्यम् अथो बुद्धिर् बलं<BR>तेजश् च पाण्डव । मनुष्याणाम् अनुयुगं<BR>ह्रसतीति निबोध मे) 3. 188. 13; however,<BR>Saṃjaya, told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that people lived<BR>for three thousand years in the Tretā (आयुः-<BR>संख्या … संख्याता राजसत्तम । तथा<BR>त्रीणि सहस्राणि त्रेतायां मनुजाधिप ॥ )<BR>6. 11. 5-6 (apparently, in Saṃjaya's narra-<BR>tion, there is confusion between the dura-<BR>tion of the Tretāyuga (cf. section<BR>B. above)<BR>and the life expectancy of the people in this<BR>Yuga).<BR>J. Simile: The region where<BR>the river Narmadā (f.) passes along the<BR>Vaiḍūrya mountain (m.) is compared with<BR>the conjunction of the Tretā (f.) and the<BR>Dvāpara (m) (वैडूर्यपर्वतं दृष्ट्वा<BR>नर्मदाम् अवतीर्य च । सन्धिर् एष नर-<BR>श्रेष्ठ त्रेताया द्वापरस्य च ॥ ) 3. 121.<BR>18-19.<BR>K. Name of Sūrya: Tretā<BR>appears as the 47th name among the hundred<BR>and eight names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya<BR>to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words Kṛta,<BR>Tretā and Dvāpara occurring in 5. 140. 7-<BR>15 are wrongly interpreted by Nī. (Bom.<BR>Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the three<BR>Yugas and not as the names of the throws<BR>of dice in a dice-game].

दक्षिणायन
Dakṣiṇāyana nt.: Name of the period<BR>of six months in which the sun moves towards<BR>the south (also expressed as दक्षिणावृत्त<BR>आदित्ये 6. 114. 96).<BR>A. Duration: It lasts for six months<BR>(षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम्) 6. 30. 25.<BR>B.<BR>Association with darkness: Vyāsa told Śuka<BR>that Dakṣiṇāyaṇa formed the night of the<BR>gods (रात्रिः स्याद् दक्षिणायनम्) 12. 224.<BR>16; Dakṣiṇāyana is associated with blind<BR>darkness and the dark night (अन्धं तमस्<BR>तमिस्रं च दक्षिणायनम् एव च) 13.<BR>101. 46.<BR>C. Bhīṣma's falling down in the<BR>Dakṣiṇāyana and his death in the Uttarā-<BR>yaṇa: When Bhīṣma fell down on the battle-<BR>field he heard a heavenly voice in the mid-<BR>region resounding all around saying “how<BR>should the high-souled Gāṅgeya (Bhīṣma)<BR>die when it was Dakṣiṇāyana ?” (कथं<BR>महात्मा गाङ्गेयः … । कालं कर्ता नर-<BR>व्याघ्रः संप्राप्ते दक्षिणायने) 6. 114.<BR>88; the great sages who, in the form of the<BR>swans, were sent by Gaṅgā observed that the<BR>sun was in the south when Bhīṣma fell from<BR>the chariot (दक्षिणेन च भास्करम् 6. 114.<BR>93); they said to each other: (it seems)<BR>Bhīṣma, though high-souled, shall die when<BR>it was Dakṣiṇāyaṇa (इतरेतरम् आमन्त्र्य<BR>प्राहुस् तत्र मनीषिणः । भीष्म एव महा-<BR>त्मा सन् संस्थाता दक्षिणायने ॥ ) 6. 114.<BR>94 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 119. 102: सं-<BR>स्थाता मरिष्यति); Bhīṣma then assured the<BR>sages that he had resolved that in no case<BR>would he go (from this world) when the<BR>sun was turned towards the south (तान्<BR>अब्रवीच् छान्तनवो नाहं गन्ता कथं-<BR>चन । दक्षिणावृत्त आदित्ये एतन् मे मनसि<BR>स्थितम् ॥ ) 6. 114. 96; Yudhiṣṭhira became<BR>anxious when the realized that Bhīṣma had only<BR>a few days to live in the Dakṣiṇāyana and<BR>that he would soon leave for the highest state<BR>when the sun had started moving (north-<BR>wards) (शेषम् अल्पं द्मानां ते दक्षिणा-<BR>यनभास्करे । आवृत्ते भगवत्य् अर्के गन्त्-<BR>आसि परमां गतिम् ॥ ) 12. 291. 4; the period<BR>of Dakṣiṇāyaṇa, when Bhīṣma fell, is alluded<BR>to in Bhīṣma's instruction to Yudhiṣṭhira to<BR>come back to him when the sun had return-<BR>ed (from the southerly course) (विनिवृत्ते<BR>दिनकरे) 13. 152. 10; it is also alluded to<BR>when Yudhiṣṭhira returned to meet Bhīṣma<BR>(दृष्ट्वा निवृत्तम् आदित्यम् प्रवृत्तं चोत्तरा-<BR>यणम्) 13. 153. 6; when Bhīṣma, on seeing<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira, greeted him and said that the sun<BR>had, indeed, returned (from the southerly<BR>course) (परिवृत्तो हि भगवान् सहस्रांशुर्<BR>दिवाकरः) 13. 153. 26; and when Bhīṣma,<BR>composed in attitude, put his entire bodily<BR>function in his self as soon as the sun had<BR>returned (from the south) (निवृत्तमात्रे त्व्<BR>अयने उत्तरे वै दिवाकरे । समावेशयद्<BR>आत्मानम् आत्मन्य् एव समाहितः ॥ ) 12. 47.<BR>3; Bhīṣma finally died when the sun left the<BR>southerly course and the Uttarāyaṇa had start-<BR>ed (अकरोत् स ततः कालं शरतल्पगतो<BR>मुनिः ॥ अयनं दक्षिणं हित्वा संप्राप्ते<BR>चोत्तरायणे ॥ ) 14. 59. 12.<BR>D. Death in<BR>the Dakṣiṇāyana: If a Yogī dies during the six<BR>months of the Dakṣiṇāyana he, after reaching<BR>the moon's realm of light, returns to this<BR>world (षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् । तत्र चान्-<BR>द्रमसं ज्योतिर् योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥ )<BR>6. 30. 25; Nārada, while consoling Sṛñjaya<BR>lamenting over the death of his son, told<BR>him that Ambarīṣa, son of Nābhāga, and<BR>hundreds of other kings who performed the<BR>Aśvamedha, went towards the Dakṣiṇāyana<BR>(i. e. died during the Dakṣiṇāyana) (सर्वे<BR>ऽश्वमेधैर् ईजानास् ते ऽभ्ययुर् दक्षिणाय-<BR>नम्) 12. 29. 96; (Nī., however, who reads<BR>अन्वयुः, on Bom. Ed. 12. 29. 103: सर्वे<BR>राजानः … दक्षिणायनम् अनु पश्चात् अयुर्<BR>गताः । उत्तरायणमार्गेण हिरण्यगर्भ-<BR>लोकं प्राप्ताः इत्य् अर्थः); but men who<BR>perform bad deeds and who die in the<BR>Dakṣiṇāyana wait upon Dharmarāja (Yama)<BR>in his सभा (नरा दुष्कृतकर्माणो दक्षि-<BR>णायनमृत्यवः । … उपासते धर्मराजम्)<BR>2. 8. 28-29.

देवयुग
Devayuga nt.: See Kṛtayuga.

द्वापर
Dvāpara m., nt.: Name of the third<BR>Yuga among the four Yugas.<BR>A. Place among the four Yugas:<BR>Its place is third, mentioned after the Tretā<BR>and before the Kali (कृतं त्रेता द्वा-<BR>परं च पुष्यं च कुरुवर्धन) 6.<BR>11. 3; 12. 224. 18; the Dvāpara starts<BR>when the Tretā ends (त्रेतानिर्मोक्षसमये<BR>द्वापरप्रतिपादने) 12. 139. 14; and<BR>the Kali starts when the Dvāpara ends<BR>(सङ्क्षेपाद् द्वापरस्याथ ततः पुष्यं<BR>प्रवर्तते) 6. 11. 4; hence also the junctions<BR>of the Tretā and the Dvāpara on the one<BR>hand and of the Dvāpara and the Kali<BR>on the other are referred to 1. 2. 3; 12.<BR>139. 13; 12. 326. 78; 1. 2. 9; 12. 326. 82.<BR>B. Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>that the duration of the Dvāpara Yuga was<BR>two thousand years with dawns and twilights<BR>of two hundred years each at both ends (तथा<BR>वर्षसहस्रे द्वे द्वापरं परिमाणतः ।<BR>तस्यापि द्विशती संध्या संध्यांशस् च<BR>ततः परम् ॥ संध्यासंध्यांशयोस् तुल्-<BR>यं प्रमाणम् उपधारय) 3. 186. 20-<BR>21 (for Nī's explanation of संध्या and<BR>संध्यांश see above Kali, section C,<BR>p. 234); the same duration for the Dvāpara<BR>was told by Vyāsa to Śuka without naming<BR>the Yuga, but indicating it in relation to the<BR>Kṛta 12. 224. 20.<BR>C. Events occurring<BR>in the Dvāpara: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira that formerly, at the junction of the<BR>Tretā and the Dvāpara, there occurred a<BR>terrible drought lasting for twelve years due<BR>to the working of the fate (दैवविधि-<BR>क्रमात्); when the Tretā was about to end<BR>and the Dvāpara was to set in Indra did<BR>not release rain for twelve years (त्रेतानिर्-<BR>मोक्षसमये द्वापरप्रतिपादने ॥ न<BR>ववर्ष सहस्राक्षः) 12. 139. 13-15; (2)<BR>Sūta Ugraśravas told the sages assembled in<BR>the Naimiṣa forest that at the junction of<BR>the Tretā and the Dvāpara (त्रेताद्वापरयोः<BR>संधौ) Rāma destroyed the princely<BR>Kṣatriyas again and again 1. 2. 3 (but<BR>see the next event); (3) Bhagavān (Nārā-<BR>yaṇa) told Nārada that at the junction<BR>of the Tretā and the Dvāpara (संधौ<BR>तु समनुप्राप्ते त्रेतायां द्वापरस्य<BR>च) he would be born as Rāma, son of<BR>Daśaratha 12. 326. 78; (4) Bhagavān<BR>(Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that towards the end<BR>of the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali<BR>(द्वापरस्य कलेश् चैव संधौ पर्यव-<BR>सानिके) he would be born in Mathurā for (the<BR>killing of) Kaṃsa 12. 326. 82; (5) at the<BR>junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali the<BR>armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas fought<BR>each other near Samantapañcaka 1. 2. 9.<BR>D.<BR>Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) and the Dvāpara:<BR>(1) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārka-<BR>ṇḍeya that he has red colour in the Dvāpara<BR>Yuga (रक्तो द्वापरम् आसाद्य) 3. 187. 31;<BR>but according to Hanūmant Viṣṇu becomes<BR>yellow in the Dvāpara (द्वापरे ऽपि युगे …<BR>विष्णुर् वै पीततां याति) 3. 148. 26; (3)<BR>Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was<BR>strength in the Dvāpara (बलं त्व् आसीद् द्वा-<BR>परे पार्थ कृष्णः) 13. 143. 9.<BR>E. King<BR>and the Dvāpara: According to Utathya<BR>Aṅgiras all the four Yugas depend on the<BR>king's behaviour, hence a king himself is<BR>called Yuga (राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव<BR>युगम् उच्यते) 12. 92. 6; Bhīṣma had no<BR>doubt that all the Yugas were rooted in<BR>a king (राजमूलानि सर्वाणि मम नास्त्य्<BR>अत्र संशयः) 12. 139. 10; it is the king<BR>who created a Yuga—whether it was the<BR>Kṛta, the Tretā, or the Dvāpara 5. 130. 16 =<BR>12. 70. 25 (also cf. राजा कालस्य कारणम्<BR>5. 130. 15 = 12. 70. 6); when a king gives<BR>up half of the दण्डनीति and practises only<BR>one half of it, then the Dvāpara age sets<BR>in (अर्धं त्यक्त्वा यदा राजा नीत्यर्धम्<BR>अनुवर्तते । ततस् तु द्वापरं नाम स<BR>कालः संप्रवर्तते ॥ ) 12. 70. 16; the<BR>धर्म practised by the king in the Dvāpara<BR>is deficient in two quarters (द्वापरे तु<BR>द्विपादेन (ऊनः)) 12. 259. 32; by bringing<BR>about the Dvāpara a king lives in heaven<BR>only according to his share (i. e. not for a long<BR>time) (प्रवर्तनाद् द्वापरस्य (स्वर्गम्)<BR>यथाभागम् य्पाश्नुते) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70.<BR>27; (description of the behaviour of people in<BR>the Dvāpara in the absence of the दण्डनीति<BR>12. 65. 24-27).<BR>F. Dvāpara and धर्म:<BR>In the Dvāpara Yuga, धर्म will lose two<BR>of its four feet and the age will be marked<BR>by a mixture (of धर्म and अधर्म)<BR>(ततो वै द्वापरं नाम मिश्रः कालो<BR>भविष्यति । द्विपादहीनो धर्मश् च युगे<BR>तस्मिन् भविष्यति) 12. 327. 75; (द्वापरे<BR>ऽर्धेन व्यामिश्रो धर्म उच्यते) 3. 188.<BR>11 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 190. 10: अर्धेन<BR>अधर्मेण); (अशुभस्य तदा अर्धं द्वाव्<BR>अंशाव् अनुवर्तते) 12. 70. 17; (द्वापरे ऽपि<BR>युगे धर्मो द्विभागोनः प्रवर्तते) 3.<BR>148. 26; 12. 259. 32; in the Yugas that<BR>follow the Kṛta the traditional धर्म is<BR>displaced successively by one quarter and in-<BR>stead अधर्म increases due to the practice<BR>of theft, falsehood and deceit 12. 224. 23; the<BR>धर्मस् in the Dvāpara are different from<BR>those in the Kṛta and the Tretā 12. 224. 26 =<BR>12. 252. 8; according to Mārkaṇḍeya, however,<BR>the धर्म for the Kṛta, the Tretā and the<BR>Dvāpara was the same (एष ढर्मः कृत-<BR>युगे त्रेतायां द्वापरे तथा) 3. 189. 13;<BR>sacrifice was considered to be the best धर्म<BR>for the Dvāpara (द्वापरे यज्ञम् एवाहुः<BR>(उत्तमम्)) 12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told<BR>Bhīma that the times in different Yugas were<BR>different; he and Bhīma lived at a time when<BR>the Dvāpara was about to end and hence he<BR>could not assume the form he had taken in<BR>the earlier Yuga (अयं प्रध्वंसनः कालो<BR>नाद्य तद् रूपम् अस्ति मे) 3. 148. 6;<BR>Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva, along with Saṃkaraṣṇa, is<BR>praised following the Sātvata rites when the<BR>Dvāpara ends, and the Kali begins (द्वाप-<BR>रस्य युगस्यान्ते आदौ कलियुगस्य च ।<BR>सात्वतं विधिं आस्थाय गीतः संकर्षणेन<BR>यः (i. e. कृष्णः) 6. 62. 39.<BR>G. Dvāpara,<BR>sacrifice and the Vedas: Vyāsa told his son<BR>Śuka that on account of the limitation on the<BR>life expectancy (of human beings) sacrifices,<BR>in the Dvāparayuga, get into disarray (संर्च्-<BR>धाद् आयुषस् त्व् एते (i. e. यज्ञाः) व्यस्यन्ते<BR>द्वापरे युगे) 12. 224. 65 = 12. 230. 14;<BR>they fall into ruin (द्वापरे विप्लवं यान्ति<BR>यज्ञाः) 12. 224. 62 = 12. 230. 15 (विप्लवं<BR>यान्ति वेदाः); however, sacrifice considered<BR>to be the best धर्म for the Dvāpara<BR>(द्वापरे यज्ञम् एवाहुः (उत्तमम्) 12.<BR>224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that in the<BR>Dvāpara the Veda is foretold; hence some<BR>study all the four Vedas, others three, two,<BR>or one; but some do not study a single ऋच्; as<BR>men did not realize the sacred text to be one<BR>Veda, the Veda was divided into many<BR>(Vedas) (द्वापरे ऽपि युगे … चतुर्धा<BR>वेद एव च ॥ ततो ऽन्ये च चतुर्वेदास्<BR>त्रिवेदाश् च तथापरे । द्विवेदाश् चैकवेदाश्-<BR>चाप्य् अनृचश् च तथापरे ॥ … एकवेदस्य<BR>चाज्ञानाद् वेदास् ते बहवः कृताः) 3. 148.<BR>26-27, 29 (Nī., on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 28,<BR>offers an alternative explanation: यद् वा<BR>चतुर्वेदा इति वेदत्रयोक्तं कर्म ज्योतिष्टो-<BR>मादिकम् । अथर्वणोपनिषदुक्तम् ध्या-<BR>नं च सहैव वानुतिष्ठन्तीति कर्मोपास्ति-<BR>समुच्चय उक्तः । त्रिवेदा इति केवलकर्-<BR>मठाः । द्विवेदा इति स्वशाखोक्तं सं-<BR>ध्यावन्दनादि कर्म ध्यानं चानुति-<BR>ष्ठन्ति । एकवेदा ध्यानैकनिष्ठाः॑<BR>अनृचः कृतकृत्याः । ); (also cf. Maheśvara<BR>(Viṣṇu) recommending the performance of<BR>sacrifices to satisfy the gods and the gods,<BR>on their part, sustaining the worlds in the<BR>(three) Yugas other than the Kṛta 12. 327.<BR>53-60).<BR>H. Nature: According to the<BR>description of the Dvāpara given by Hanū-<BR>mant to Bhīma, since in that age the Vedas<BR>become fourfold and the शास्त्रस् multiply,<BR>the Vedic rites are variously performed;<BR>people, given to austerities and gifts, become<BR>राजस by nature; since truth falls down,<BR>rarely any one abides by truth (एवं<BR>शास्त्रेषु भिन्नेषु बहुधा नियते कृइया ।<BR>तपोदानप्रवृत्ता च राजसी भवति प्रजा ॥<BR> … सत्यस्य चेह विभ्रंशात् सत्ये कश्चिद्<BR>अवस्थितः ॥ ) 3. 148. 28-29; for further<BR>description of the Dvāpara cf. 3. 148. 30-31;<BR>Hanūmant concludes that people in the<BR>Dvāpara perish due to the practice of<BR>अधर्म (एवं द्वापरम् आसाद्य प्रजाः<BR>क्षीयन्त्य् अधर्मतः) 3. 148. 32; according<BR>to Saṃjaya, in the Dvāpara all the four<BR>वर्णस् are full of energy; they are great<BR>heroes, desirous of killing each other; on the<BR>whole, the Dvāpara in which Saṃjaya lived<BR>was characterized by contraction (of the me-<BR>rits in all respects) (सर्ववर्णा महाराज<BR>जायन्ते द्वापरे सति । महोत्साहा महावीर्-<BR>याः परस्परवधैषिणः ॥ … संक्षेपो<BR>वर्तते राजन् द्वापरे ऽस्मिन् नराधिप)<BR>6. 11. 11, 14 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 15:<BR>संक्षेपो गुणानाम् इति शेषः); Vyāsa told<BR>Śuka that all the वर्णस् and the आश्रमस्<BR>fall into disarray due to the limitation on<BR>the life-span (वर्णाश्रमास् तथा । संर्च्-<BR>धाद् आयुषस् त्व् एते व्यस्यन्ते द्वापरे<BR>युगे) 12. 230. 14; he also said that people<BR>in the Dvāpara (as in the Tretā and the Kali)<BR>entertain doubt (त्रेतायां द्वापरे चैव<BR>कलिजाश् च ससंशयाः 12. 230. 7) as to<BR>what is at the root of a man's success—<BR>his effort, fate, or nature 12. 230. 4; in the<BR>Dvāpara, the earth has to be ploughed and<BR>even then it does not yield much harvest<BR>(कृष्टपच्यैव पृथिवी भवत्य् अल्पफला<BR>तथा) 12. 70. 17; in this Yuga people have to<BR>copulate to beget progeny (द्वापरे मैथुनो<BR>धर्मः प्रजानाम् अभवन् नृप) 12. 200.<BR>37; evil tribes like the Talavaras and the<BR>Andharkas from the south and the Yaunas<BR>(Yavanas) and the Gāndhāras from the<BR>north move on earth from the Tretā onwards<BR>(i. e. also in the Dvāpara) 12. 200. 39-40, 42.<BR>I. Life expectancy: Vyāsa told his son<BR>Śuka that the life expectancy of people dimini-<BR>shes by a quarter in each succeeding Yuga<BR>after the Kṛta, hence in the Dvāpara they<BR>live for two hundred years ( … त्रेतादिष्व्<BR>एतेषां पादशो ह्रसते वयः) 12. 224. 24;<BR>Vyāsa also told Śuka that according to his<BR>information life expectancy of people, along<BR>with other things, gradually decreased in the<BR>successive Yugas ( … अनुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति<BR>च नः श्रुतम् । आयूंषि … ) 12. 224. 25;<BR>this is also what Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira (आयुर् … मनुष्याणाम् अनुयुगं<BR>ह्रसतीति निबोध मे) 3. 188. 13; according<BR>to Saṃjaya, however, the life expectancy of<BR>people in the Dvāpara was two thousand<BR>years (आयुःसंख्या … संक्त्याता … । द्वि-<BR>सहस्रं द्वापरे तु) 6. 11. 5-6 (ap-<BR>parently Saṃjaya made confusion between<BR>the duration of the Dvāpara age and the<BR>life expectancy of people in that Yuga).<BR>J. Simile: The place where the river<BR>Narmadā passes along the Vaiḍūrya moun-<BR>tain is compared to the junction of the Tretā<BR>(f.) and the Dvāpara (m.) 3. 121. 18-19.<BR>K. Name of Sūrya: Dvāpara appears as<BR>48th name among the hundred and eight<BR>names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words कृत, त्रेता,<BR>द्वापर and कलि occurring in 5. 140. 7-15<BR>are wrongly interpreted by Nīlakaṇṭha (Bom.<BR>Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the four Yugas,<BR>and not as the names of the throws in the<BR>game of dice].

धनिष्ठा
Dhaniṣṭhā f. (sg., pl.): Name of a<BR>नक्षत्र।<BR>A. Computation of time began with it:<BR>When the Abhijit नक्षत्र dropped down from<BR>the sky and Indra was confused in calculating<BR>time, Brahman ordained that time (काल =<BR>युग) began with Dhaniṣṭhā, whereas for-<BR>merly it began with Rohiṇī (धनिष्ठादिस्<BR>तदा कालो ब्रह्मणा परिनिर्मितः । रोहिण्या-<BR>द्यो ऽभवत् पूर्वम्) 3. 219. 10 (Nī. on<BR>Bom.

Religious rites: (1) Nārada told Devakī<BR>(13. 63. 2-4) that if one, with composed<BR>mind, gave a cart, yoked with bulls and filled<BR>with garments and food (?) under the con-<BR>stellation Dhaniṣṭhā he, in the next life,<BR>instantly attained kingdom (गोप्रयुक्तं<BR>धनिष्ठासु यानं दत्त्वा समाहितः ।<BR>वस्त्ररश्मिधरं सद्यः प्रेत्य राज्यम्<BR>प्रपद्यते) 13. 63. 29; (2) Yama told<BR>Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that if one offered a<BR>काम्य श्राद्ध under the Dhaniṣṭhā (धनि-<BR>ष्थायाम्) he obtained a share in kingdom<BR>and did not meet with difficulties 13. 89. 12.

धर्मयुग

धूमकेतु
Dhūmaketu m.: A comet; or planet<BR>Rāhu (?); according to Nī., name of a sub-<BR>ordinate planet (उपग्रह).<BR>Among the bad omens which betokened<BR>the annihilation of the Kauravas, and which<BR>were pointed out by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra,<BR>one was related to a very fierce comet taking<BR>hold of the Puṣya constellation (अभावं<BR>हि विशेषेष्ण कुरूणां प्रतिपश्यति । धूम-<BR>केतुर् महाघोरः पुष्यम् आक्रम्य<BR>तिष्ठति ॥ ) 6. 3. 12; (महाघोर धूम-<BR>केतु may stand for Rāhu, cf. 6. 3. 26<BR>where a तीव्रग्रह which very probably<BR>means Rāhu, is compared to धूमकेतु; ac-<BR>cording to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 13 Dhūma-<BR>ketu is a particular उपग्रह (उपग्रह-<BR>विशेषः); he looks upon both Rāhu and Ketu<BR>as subordinate planets, cf. his Comm. on Bom.<BR>Ed. 6. 17. 2). [See Rāhu]

ध्रुव
Dhruva1 m.: Name of the polar star.<BR>A. Described as the best among the<BR>heavenly bodies (ज्योतिषां श्रेष्ठम्) 12.<BR>326. 53; identified as the son of king Uttāna-<BR>pāda (औत्तानपाद) 13. 3. 15.<BR>B. Bad<BR>omen: Among the bad omens reported by<BR>Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra one was related to the<BR>blazing Dhruva's movement towards left<BR>which foretold terrible happenings (ध्रुवः<BR>प्रज्वलितो घोरम् अपसव्यं प्रवर्तते)<BR>6. 3. 16.<BR>C. Relation with Nārāyaṇa:<BR>Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) pointed out to Nārada<BR>that Dhruva, the best among the luminous<BR>heavenly bodies moving in the sky, was<BR>within him (ध्रुवं च ज्योतिषां श्रेष्ठं<BR>पश्य नारद खेचरं (मत्स्थं) 12.<BR>326. 53.<BR>D. Relation with the star<BR>Viśvāmitra: Viśvāmitra, stationed between<BR>Dhruva Auttānapāda and the Brahmarṣis<BR>(the seven stars forming the constellation<BR>Ursa Major), shines constantly in the north<BR>(ध्रुवस्यौत्तानपादस्य ब्रह्मर्षीणां<BR>तथैव च । मध्ये ज्वलति यो नित्यम्<BR>उदीचीम् आश्रितो दिशम्) 13. 3. 15.<BR>E. Neg-<BR>lecting Dhruva harmful: Yājñavalkya told<BR>Janaka that those who fail to see Dhruva,<BR>having seen it once before, have only a year<BR>to live (संवत्सरवियोगस्य संभवेयुः<BR>शरीरिणः ॥ यो ऽरुन्धतीं न पश्येत<BR>दृष्टपूर्वां कदाचन । तथैव ध्रुवम्<BR>इत्य् आहुः) 12. 305. 8-9.<BR>F. Simile: All<BR>ascetics of the Naranārāyaṇāśrama (12. 126.<BR>2) sat round king Vīradyumna as do the<BR>seven sages round Dhruva 12. 126. 25. [For<BR>Dhruva also see Section 1. 7]

ध्रुव
Dhruva2 nt.: Designation of the four<BR>नक्षत्रस् (Rohiṇī, Pūrvā Phalgunī, Pūrvā<BR>Bhādrapadā and Pūrvāṣāḍhā).<BR>When the Pāṇḍavas decided to get the<BR>wealth of king Marutta Āvikṣita, left on the<BR>mountain Himavant, they ordered their army<BR>to march out on the day (i. e. Sunday ?, see the<BR>next) which was presided over by the Dhruva<BR>नक्षत्र (कृत्वा तु पाण्डवाः सर्वे रत्ना-<BR>हरणनिश्चयम् । सेनाम् आज्ञापयाम् आसुर्<BR>नक्षत्रे ऽहनि च ध्रुवे) 14. 62. 17 (Nī.<BR>on Bom. Ed. 14. 63. 18: ध्रुवे नक्षत्रे<BR>रोहिण्याम् उत्तरात्रये च). [See Dhruva3]

ध्रुव
Dhruva3 nt.: Designation of the day<BR>presided over by Dhruva (? i. e. Sunday ?).<BR>The Pāṇḍavas ordered their army to<BR>march out on the ध्रुव day (सेनाम् आज्ञा-<BR>पयाम् आसुर् नक्षत्रे ऽहनि च ध्रुवे) 14.<BR>62. 17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 14. 63. 18: अहनि<BR>वारे ध्रुवे रविवारे। But Nī.'s explanation<BR>amounts to anachronism). [See Dhruva2]

पुनर्वसु
Punarvasu m. (sg., du.): Name of a<BR>नक्षत्र।<BR>A. Religious rites: (1) Gifts under<BR>this नक्षत्र: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63.<BR>2-4) that if one gave as gifts cakes<BR>(अपूपान्) and food (अन्नानि) under Punar-<BR>vasu (पुनर्वसौ) one obtained fame and<BR>good look and was born in a family that had<BR>ample food (बह्वन्ने जायते कुले) 13. 63. 9;<BR>(2) श्राद्ध: Yama told Śaśabindu (13.<BR>89. 1) that if one offered a काम्य श्राद्ध<BR>under Punarvasu he reaped (ample) harvest<BR>(कृषिभागी भवेन् मर्त्यः कुर्वञ् श्राद्-<BR>धं पुनर्वसौ) 13. 89. 4.<BR>B. Smile:<BR>The two Pāñcāla warriors (Candradeva and<BR>Daṇḍadhara cf. the various readings under<BR>8. 33. 15) guarding the wheels of Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>shone on his two sides as do the two Punar-<BR>vasu stars seen on the two sides of the moon<BR>(रथाभ्याशे चकासेते चन्द्रस्येव पुनर्-<BR>वसू) 8. 33. 16.

पुष्य
Puṣya1 m.: Name of a नक्षत्र, and<BR>of the moon's conjunction with this नक्षत्र<BR>(Puṣyayoga); also called Tiṣya (3. 188. 87).<BR>A. Description: auspicious (पुण्य-<BR>योग) 3. 261. 15.<BR>B. Considered favour-<BR>able for marching out of the army or for<BR>going out on a pilgrimage: (1) Duryodhana<BR>urged again and again the assembled kings<BR>to march towards Kurukṣetra on that very<BR>day since it was presided over by the Puṣya<BR>नक्षत्र (आज्ञापयच् च राज्ञस् तान् पार्थि-<BR>वान् दुष्टचेतसः । प्रयाध्वं वै कुरु-<BR>क्षेत्रं पुष्यो ऽद्येति पुनः पुनः) 5. 148.<BR>3 (Nī. on Bom.

Epic<BR>events related to the Gaṅgā: (1) Marriage<BR>with Saṃtanu and birth of Bhīṣma: King<BR>Pratīpa once went to the bank of the Gaṅgā<BR>(गङ्गातीरगतः) and sat down for many years<BR>muttering prayers (जपन्) 1. 92. 1; Gaṅgā,<BR>in the form of a beautiful woman, rose from<BR>the waters and sat on the right thigh of king<BR>Pratīpa 1. 92. 2-3; when asked by the king<BR>what he might do to please her she requested<BR>him to make love with her (त्वाम् अहं<BR>कामये राजन् कुरुश्रेष्ठ भजस्व माम्)<BR>1. 92. 4-5; but, at the king's suggestion,<BR>she agreed to be his daughter-in-law and<BR>disappeared 1. 92. 9-12, 15-16; she laid<BR>down the condition that the king's son (her<BR>future husband) should not know her identity<BR>and should never question the propriety of her<BR>actions (स मे नाभिजनज्ञः स्याद् आचरे-<BR>यं च यद् विभो । तत् सर्वम् एव पुत्रस्<BR>ते न मीमांसेत कर्हिचित्) 1. 92. 13-14;<BR>king Śāṃtanu, son of Pratīpa, once went for<BR>hunting on the bank of the Gaṅgā; the river<BR>appeared before him in the form of a beautiful<BR>woman 1. 92. 25-26; when Śaṃtanu requested<BR>her to be his wife she agreed on condition that<BR>he did not prevent her from doing anything,<BR>auspicious or otherwise (शुभं वा यदि<BR>वाशुभम्); should the king question her,<BR>she would abandon him 1. 92. 31-35; when<BR>the king consented, she, full of lustre, attended<BR>on him as his wife 1. 92. 39-40; Gaṅgā, as<BR>the wife of Śaṃtanu, gave birth to eight sons<BR>seven of whom, as soon as they were born,<BR>she threw away in the waters of the river<BR>Gaṅgā; the king did not object to her on the<BR>first seven occasions, but on the eighth occa-<BR>sion he asked her to spare him a son; he<BR>also wanted to know who she really was<BR>1. 92. 44-47; when thus questioned, she told<BR>Śaṃtanu that she was the river Gaṅgā, the<BR>daughter of Jahnu, and that she lived with<BR>him to achieve some purpose of the gods<BR>(देवकार्यार्थसिद्ध्यर्थम् 1. 92. 49); the<BR>eight sons she bore him were the eight Vasus<BR>who were born as human beings due to the<BR>curse of Vasiṣtha; she had promised the<BR>Vasus that she would release them from their<BR>human birth as soon as they were born<BR>(cf. 1. 93. 40); she blessed the king before<BR>her departure (स्वस्ति ते ऽस्तु गमिष्यामि); she<BR>told the king that she had lived with the Vasus<BR>(while they were in her womb) in succession<BR>(एष पर्यायवासो मे वसूनां संनिधौ<BR>कृतः) and that the eighth son who was to be<BR>given to him later by her was the one born of<BR>her (Gaṅgā) (मत्प्रसूतं विजानीहि गङ्गा-<BR>दत्तम् इमं सुतम्) 1. 92. 48-55; Śaṃtanu<BR>asked Jāhnavī who was Āpava (Vasiṣṭha)<BR>and what fault the Vasus had committed to<BR>invite the curse of Vasiṣṭha; he also asked<BR>why the eighth son (Gaṅgādatta) was requir-<BR>ed to live long among human beings 1. 9. 1-3;<BR>Gaṅgā Jāhnavī then told the king the whole<BR>story 1. 93. 5-42; Gaṅgā then disappeared<BR>taking the last-born son with her 1. 93. 43;<BR>many years later, King Śaṃtanu, while once<BR>hunting along the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī,<BR>noticed that the river had little water (अल्प-<BR>जलाम् 1. 94. 21) and was not flowing as before<BR>(स्यन्दते किं न्व् इयं नाद्य 1. 94. 22);<BR>trying to find out the cause of it the king<BR>saw a young boy who had covered waters of<BR>the entire Gaṅgā with his arrows 1. 94. 24-25;<BR>Śaṃtanu suspected the boy to be his son and<BR>hence asked Gaṅgā to show herself to him;<BR>Gaṅgā appeared before the king holding the<BR>boy in her right hand, but the king did not<BR>immediately recognize her; Gaṅgā handed<BR>over the son to the king 1. 94. 28-31, 36;<BR>Śaṃtanu's marriage with Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī<BR>and the birth of Devavrata by her mentioned<BR>in 1. 57. 76; 1. 90. 50; 5. 179. 5; 12. 38. 8;<BR>12. 46. 15; the birth of the Vasus from Bhāgī-<BR>rathī in the house of Śaṃtanu mentioned<BR>in 1. 2. 78; 1. 61. 68; (2) Her role in<BR>Bhīṣma's fight with Rāma Jāmadagnya:<BR>When the fight between Bhīṣma and Rāma<BR>Jāmadagnya was imminent, the latter threa-<BR>tened to kill Bhīṣma so that Jāhnavī might<BR>see him lying on the bed of arrows and the<BR>daughter of Bhagīratha (Gaṅgā), who<BR>gave birth to him, might weep seeing him<BR>dead 5. 179. 3-5; when Bhīṣma was ready<BR>to fight with Rāma, his mother appeared be-<BR>fore him in her original form (स्वरूपिणी)<BR>to try to dissuade Bhīṣma from the fight, and<BR>expressed her readiness to go to Jāmadagnya<BR>to beg him not to engage Bhīṣma, who was<BR>his pupil, in fight; Bhīṣma then told her the<BR>incidents which had led to the fight; then the<BR>river (Gaṅgā) went to Rāma to dissuade<BR>him; when told that it was Bhīṣma who was<BR>to be dissuaded, Gaṅgā returned to Bhīṣma<BR>and again pleaded with him; but Bhīṣma,<BR>angered, did not agree to her request 5. 179.<BR>22-30; Bhāgīrathī again appeared later in<BR>this event when she joined the sages, Nārada<BR>and others, who stood between Bhīṣma and<BR>Rāma to stop them fighting with each other<BR>5. 186. 27; (3) Her pleading with Ambā:<BR>Gaṅgā, the mother of Bhīṣma, rose from the<BR>waters and asked Ambā the purpose she<BR>wanted to achieve by performing the auste-<BR>rities; when told by Ambā that her effort was<BR>aimed at the destruction of Bhīṣma, Gaṅgā<BR>(सागरगा) told her that her purpose was<BR>crooked (जिह्मं चरसि भामिनि); if she<BR>persisted in observing her vows and if she<BR>died during the observance of the vows she<BR>would become a crooked river having water<BR>only during the rainy season and not in the<BR>remaining eight months (नदी भविष्यसि<BR>शुभे कुटिला वार्षिकोदका । … वार्षिकी नाष्ट-<BR>मासिकी); Bhīsma's mother then returned from<BR>the place where Ambā practised austerities<BR>6. 187. 29-36; (4) Death of Bhīṣma: When<BR>Bhīṣma, after his fall on the battle-field,<BR>resolved to hold his life till the start of the<BR>Uttarāyaṇa, Gaṅgā, knowing his resolve,<BR>sent to him the great sages in the form of<BR>swans 6. 114. 90; much later, after the<BR>cremation of Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the<BR>rest, including Vyāsa, Nārada, Asita and<BR>Kṛṣṇa, went to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī<BR>and all the Kṣatriya warriors and citizens<BR>offered water offerings to him; then Bhāgīrathī<BR>arose from water and, crying, lamented the<BR>death of her son; she addressed her words to<BR>the Kauravas praising and recounting the good<BR>qualities of Bhīṣma 13. 154. 17-26; the<BR>grieved Bhāgīrathī was consoled by Dāmo-<BR>dara (Kṛṣṇa) assuring her that her son was<BR>brought down from the chariot by Arjuna<BR>and not by Śikhaṇḍin and that he had return-<BR>ed to the Vasus in heaven 13. 154. 27-32;<BR>Bhāgīrathī then gave up grief and entered<BR>her own waters; Kṛṣṇa and others, after<BR>honouring the river (सत्कृत्य ते तां सरितम्)<BR>returned from that place (to Hāstinapura)<BR>when permitted by her to do so (अनुज्ञातास्<BR>तया) 13. 154. 33-34; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had<BR>offered water offerings to Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>came out of water with Dhṛtarāṣṭra and,<BR>grief-stricken, fell on the bank of the Gaṅgā<BR>14. 1. 1-2; (5) Arjuna punished for his role<BR>in the fall of Bhīṣma: Ulūpī told Arjuna<BR>that his defeat at the hands of his son Babhru-<BR>vāhana was an expiation (निष्कृतिः) he had<BR>to undergo for the अधर्म committed by him<BR>in bringing about the fall of Bhīṣma 14. 82. 8;<BR>this expiation was prescribed by the Vasus<BR>and the Gaṅgā (एषा तु विहिता शान्तिः पुत्राद्<BR>यां प्राप्तवान् असि । वसुभिर् वसुधापाल<BR>गङ्गया च महामते) 14. 82. 11; when<BR>Bhīṣma died (हते शान्तनवे नृपे) the<BR>Vasus emerged from waters and meeting the<BR>great river, told her that they wanted to<BR>curse Arjuna for his misdeed in the war, to<BR>which Bhāgīrathī agreed (इदम् ऊचुर् वचो<BR>घोरं भागीरथ्या मते तदा ॥ … वयम्<BR>अप्य् अर्जुनं … शापेन योजयामेति तथास्त्व्<BR>इति चाब्रवीत् ॥ ) 14. 82. 12-15; (6) The<BR>Pāṇḍavas came across the Gaṅgā at various<BR>places: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira and his bro-<BR>thers decided to go on a pilgrimage, the<BR>Brāhmaṇas expressed their wish to visit with<BR>them the Gaṅgā and other rivers 3. 91. 10;<BR>when they arrived at Prayāga at the con-<BR>fluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā the<BR>Pāṇḍavas bathed in their waters (आप्लुत्य<BR>गात्राणि), practised the severest austerities<BR>and gave gifts to the Brāhmaṇas 3. 93. 5-6;<BR>(ii) They again arrived at the Bhāgīrathī<BR>flowing by the side of the Agastyāśrama<BR>where Lomaśa advised them to bathe at<BR>will (यथेष्टम् अवगाह्यताम्) 3. 97. 27;<BR>(iii) Going further from the river Kauśikī,<BR>they arrived at the place where the Gaṅgā<BR>met the ocean and bathed there in waters<BR>of five hundred rivers (नदीशतानां पञ्चा-<BR>नां मध्ये चक्रे समाप्लवम्) 3. 114. 2;<BR>(iv) On reaching the vicinity of the Maināka<BR>mountain, Lomaśa showed the river Gaṅgā<BR>to Yudhiṣṭhira; he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to<BR>bathe in the Gaṅgā to be freed of all sins;<BR>he also advised him to bathe silently (तूष्णीं<BR>गङ्गाम् … समुपस्पृश) 3. 135. 5-7; (v)<BR>When the Pāṇḍavas had crossed the Uśīra-<BR>bīja, the Maināka, the Śvetagiri and the<BR>Kālaśaila mountains, Lomaśa showed them<BR>the Gaṅgā flowing in seven currents (एषा<BR>गङ्गा सप्तविधा) 3. 140. 1-2; Lomaśa<BR>could hear the sound of the Gaṅgā on the<BR>top on the mountain Jāmbūnada 3. 140. 14;<BR>(vi) The Pāṇḍavas saw the Bhāgīrathī on<BR>the Kailāsa mountain; they lived there giving<BR>offerings to gods and manes again and again<BR>3. 145. 37, 40, 42; (7) Some events after<BR>the war and the funeral rites offered to the<BR>dead: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira went to meet<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra who had left Hāstinapura, he<BR>saw the Kaurava women lamenting on the<BR>bank of the Gaṅgā 11. 11. 5; (ii) Vyāsa,<BR>who knew that Gāndhārī would curse the<BR>Pāṇḍavas in their first meeting with her after<BR>the war, hastened to them after bathing (उप-<BR>स्पृश्य) in the Gaṅgā 11. 13. 4; (iii) After<BR>lifting the funeral pyre of Droṇa, his pupils,<BR>keeping Kṛpī in the front, proceeded to the<BR>Gaṅgā 11. 23. 42; (iv) After arranging<BR>for the cremation of all the heroes who fell<BR>in the war, Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, went towards the Gaṅgā 11.<BR>26. 44; on reaching the Gaṅgā, Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>and the Kaurava women offered water offerings<BR>to the departed (प्रचक्रुः सलिलक्रियाः);<BR>at that moment the Gaṅgā became easily<BR>fordable spreading herself out widely (सूप-<BR>तीर्थाभवद् गङ्गा भूयो विप्रससार च);<BR>the bank of the Gaṅgā then was without<BR>joy and merriment (निरानन्दम् अनुत्सवम्<BR> … गङ्गातीरम् अशोभत) 11. 27. 1-5; (v)<BR>Yudhisṭhira, after giving water offerings to<BR>Karṇa (चकारास्योदकं प्रभुः 11. 27.<BR>21) and after performing the funeral rites for<BR>him with the wives of Karṇa, came out of<BR>the river Gaṅgā (स ताभिः सह धर्मात्मा<BR>प्रेतकृत्यम् अनन्तरम् कृत्व्ōत्ततार गङ्गा-<BR>याः) 11. 27. 24; (vi) When the Pāṇḍavas,<BR>who had given water offerings, were still<BR>on the Bhāgīrathī, Dvaipāyana, Narada<BR>and others and their pupils and hundreds<BR>of thousands of other Brāhmaṇas gathered<BR>there to console Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 1. 1-2,<BR>4-5, 8; (8) Cremation of Pāṇḍu and<BR>Mādrī: The cremation was performed on<BR>an auspicious and even spot in the forest on<BR>the river Gaṅgā (रमणीये वनोद्देशे<BR>गङ्गातीरे समे शुभे); the bier (शिबिका)<BR>in which their dead bodies were brought from<BR>Hāstinapura were placed on this spot 1. 118.<BR>16-17; (9) Certain other epic events in<BR>which the Gaṅgā is referred to: (i) At<BR>Pramāṇakoṭi, Duryodhana tied up Bhīma,<BR>while he was asleep, and threw him in the<BR>waters of the Gaṅgā 1. 55. 10; 3. 13. 74;<BR>(ii) Droṇa with his pupils once went to the<BR>Gaṅgā for bathing when a crocodile caught<BR>him by his ankle (जङ्घान्ते) 1. 123. 69;<BR>(iii) When Drupada was brought captive by<BR>his pupils to Droṇa, the latter told Drupada<BR>that in future he (Drupada) would rule over<BR>the Pañcāla country which lay to the south<BR>of the Bhāgīrathī while he (Droṇa) himself<BR>would rule over the part of the country which<BR>lay to its north; Drupada then established<BR>himself in the capital city of Kampilya in the<BR>countryside of Mākandī on the river Gaṅgā<BR>ruling the southern Pāñcālas as far as the<BR>river Carmaṇvatī 1. 128. 12, 15; 1. 154. 24;<BR>(iv) Drupada while reaming along the bank<BR>of the Gāṅgā, came across a settlement of the<BR>Brāhmaṇas (ब्राह्मणावसथ) 1. 155. 5;<BR>(v) The Aṅgāraparṇa episode: The Pāṇḍa-<BR>vas on their way to the Pañcālas reached the<BR>Somaśravāyaṇa तीर्थ on the river Gaṅgā;<BR>Aṅgāraparṇa, king of the Gandharvas, had<BR>already arrived there to sport with his wives<BR>in the waters of the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī;<BR>he was angered when he heard the voice of<BR>the Pāṇḍavas approaching the river; he told<BR>the Pāṇḍavas to leave the place as the forest<BR>along the rivers Gaṅgā and Vākā belonged<BR>to him; Arjuna questioned the sole right of<BR>the Gandharva over the river either at night,<BR>or by day, or in twilight (नद्याम् अस्याम्<BR> … कस्य कॢप्तः परिग्रहः 1. 158. 15);<BR>it was therefore not proper for the Gan-<BR>dharva to withhold the river from others<BR>since that was against the age old custom<BR>(कथम् इच्छसि तां रोद्धुं नैष धर्-<BR>मः सनातनः 1. 158. 20); why should the<BR>Pāṇḍavas be restrained from touching the<BR>waters of the Bhāgīrathī 1. 158. 2, 4, 5, 11,<BR>13, 15, 20, 21; defeat of Aṅgāraparṇa in<BR>this episode alluded to in 1. 2. 86; later the<BR>Gandharva and the Pāṇḍavas took leave of<BR>each other on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī<BR>1. 174. 5; (vi) Arjuna, during the period<BR>of his exile, entered the river Gaṅgā for<BR>bathing; as he wanted to come out of the<BR>water he was dragged by Ulūpī in the water<BR>of that river 1. 206. 11-13; (vii) Arjuna,<BR>during his exile, while going to the east,<BR>crossed many rivers one of them being the<BR>Gaṅgā 1. 207. 5-6; (viii) Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma<BR>and Arjuna crossed the rivers Mālā, Carmaṇ-<BR>vatī and Gaṅgā on their way to the Magadha<BR>2. 18. 21; (ix) On account of the cries of<BR>thousands of animals that were burnt at the<BR>Khāṇḍava forest the fish in the waters (?)<BR>of the Gaṅgā were terrified 1. 219. 28<BR>(तेन शब्देन वित्रेसुर् गङ्गोदधिचरा<BR>झषाः;

there, on the bank<BR>of the Gaṅgā, he also heard the narrative of<BR>Vipula from Mārkaṇḍeya 13. 43. 17; (xiii)<BR>When the Pāṇḍavas were near the Gandha-<BR>mādana mountain (3. 155. 34) Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>showed to Bhīma the river Mahāgaṅgā 3.<BR>155. 69, 85; (xiv) The basket (मञ्जूषा)<BR>containing the newly born Karṇa went down<BR>from the river Aśvanadī to the Gaṅgā (via<BR>the Carmaṇvatī and the Yamunā) and then<BR>to the city of Campā 3. 292. 25-26; when<BR>the Sūta Adhiratha went with his wife to the<BR>Jāhnavī, she saw there by chance the floating<BR>basket brought to the bank by the waves of<BR>the Jāhnavī 3. 293. 1, 3; (xv) The army of<BR>the Kauravas, collected for the war, spread<BR>along the bank of the Gaṅgā 5. 19. 30;<BR>(xvi) Kuntī, who wished to approach Karṇa<BR>to tell him the truth about his birth, went<BR>to the Bhāgīrathī to meet him; there on the<BR>bank of the Gaṅgā she heard the sound of<BR>the prayers recited by Karṇa 5. 142. 26-27;<BR>(xvii) Arjuna wishing to propitiate Śiva<BR>to seek his help in fulfilling the vow to kill<BR>Jayadratha saw the Gaṅgā on his way 7. 57.<BR>24; (xviii) Bhīma, in search of Aśva-<BR>tthāman, reached the bank of the Bhāgīrathī<BR>where he saw Vyāsa and the other sages seated<BR>on the bank (उदकान्ते) 10. 13. 12-13;<BR>(xix) After the great war, Kṛpa, Aśvatthā-<BR>man and Kṛtavarman, after their meeting<BR>with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, rode fast on horse-back to-<BR>wards the Gaṅgā 11. 10. 19; (xx) Bhīṣma,<BR>having narrated to Yudhiṣṭhira the Itihāsa<BR>connected with the praise of the Gaṅgā<BR>(इतिहासं … गङ्गायाः स्तवसंयुतम्), ad-<BR>vised him to approach the Gaṅgā with great<BR>devotion in order to obtain the highest per-<BR>fection (सिद्धिम् उत्तमाम्); he and his<BR>brothers were delighted to hear this Itihāsa<BR>of the Gaṅgā from Bhīṣma 13. 27. 103-104;<BR>(xxi) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to retire to<BR>the forest he, along with Gāndhārī, Kuntī,<BR>Vidura and Saṃjaya, went in a day a long<BR>distance from Hastinapura and camped on<BR>the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; next morning<BR>they started from there towards the north<BR>15. 24. 16, 23; after going some distance they<BR>again camped on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;<BR>in the evening he and Gāndhārī went to the<BR>Gaṅgā and performed the prescribed puri-<BR>ficatory rites (चकार विधिवच् छौचम्);<BR>Vidura and other men performed individually<BR>all the necessary rites (चक्रुः सर्वाः क्रियास्<BR>तत्र पुरुषा विदुरादयः) after bathing in<BR>the various तीर्थस् (तीर्थेष्व् आप्लुत्य); when<BR>the purificatory rites were over Kuntī led<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the bank of the<BR>Gaṅgā; there the priests of the king laid a<BR>Vedī (कृतो वेदीपरिस्तरः) on which Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra gave offerings in the fire; from the<BR>bank of the Bhāgīrathī they all proceeded to<BR>the Kurukṣetra 15. 25. 1, 4-8; (10) Meet-<BR>ing with the dead: Vyāsa asked Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>and all those staying with him to go to the<BR>bank of the Bhāgīrathī to meet all those<BR>who fell in the war; accordingly all of them<BR>went to the Gaṅgā and resided there 15. 39.<BR>18-22; then in the evening Vyāsa bathed in<BR>the Bhāgīrathī and invoked all those who<BR>fought on the side of the Pāṇḍavas and the<BR>Kauravas; at his call, all the kings, Bhīṣma,<BR>Droṇa, and the rest, together with their armies,<BR>rose in thousands from the water (of the<BR>Bhāgīrathī) 15. 40. 4, 7, 13; after some time,<BR>at the instance of Vyāsa, they again dis-<BR>appeared plunging into the river Tripathagā<BR>(Gaṅgā) and repaired to their respective<BR>places; then Vyāsa, standing in the water<BR>(of the Tripathagā), told the Kaurava women<BR>that those who wished to obtain the worlds<BR>of their respective deceased husbands should<BR>quickly enter the water of the Jāhnavī; the<BR>women, fully believing the words of Vyāsa,<BR>took permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and entered<BR>the water of the Jāhnavī; freed of their bodies<BR>they were united with their husbands and<BR>acquired the worlds of their husbands 15.<BR>41. 13, 17-21; (11) End of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,<BR>Gāndhārī and Kuntī: When Nārada arrived<BR>at Hāstinapura to meet Yudhiṣṭhira he paid<BR>a visit to the Gaṅgā on his way; people<BR>residing near the Gaṅgā had told Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was engaged in<BR>severe austerities; Yudhiṣṭhira therefore<BR>asked Nārada if he had met Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>and the rest during his visit to the Gaṅgā<BR>and how they fared; Nārada told him that<BR>after their last meeting with Dhṛtarāṣṭra the<BR>latter had repaired to the Gaṅgādvāra; once,<BR>after his bath in the Gaṅgā, when Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra had started for his hermitage, wind<BR>arose, fire engulfed the forest, and burnt it<BR>(गङ्गायाम् आप्लुतो धीमान् आशृअमाभिमुखो<BR>ऽभवत् 15. 45. 18); Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī<BR>and Kuntī were burnt in the fire; only Saṃ-<BR>jaya escaped from the forest fire and was<BR>seen, surrounded by ascetics, by Nārada<BR>on the bank of the Gaṅgā 15. 45. 5-6, 10,<BR>29-32; Nārada further informed Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was burnt on the bank of<BR>the Jāhnavī not by the ordinary fire but by<BR>the sacred fire which Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself<BR>and his priests had left after performing the<BR>rites (i. e. the forest fire was caused by the<BR>sacred fire left by Dhṛtarāṣṭra) (नासौ वृथा-<BR>ग्निना दग्धो यथा तत्र श्रुतं मया);<BR>this was reported to Nārada by the sages<BR>whom he met on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī<BR>15. 47. 1-6; when asked by Nārada to give<BR>the water offerings to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī<BR>and Kuntī (कर्तुम् अर्हसि कौन्तेय तेषां<BR>त्वम् उदकक्रियाम्), Yudhiṣṭhira went to the<BR>Gaṅgā with his brothers and wife; there,<BR>going into the water, they all offered water<BR>(ददुस् तोयम्) and stayed outside the city<BR>to undergo purification (शौचं निवर्तय-<BR>न्तः) 15. 47. 9-13; (12) Ulūpī entered the<BR>Gaṅgā when, at the end, the Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Draupadī started for the forest 17. 1. 25;<BR>F. Past and mythological events in which<BR>the river Gaṅgā figures: (1) Past events:<BR>(i) Bhagīratha brought her down from the<BR>heaven: The sage Kapila had told Aṃśu-<BR>mant, the grandson of Sagara, that his<BR>grandson will bring down the Tripathagā<BR>from the heaven by propitiating Maheśvara<BR>for the purification of the burnt sons of<BR>Sagara 3. 107. 27; however, the descent of<BR>the Gaṅgā from the heaven was first attem-<BR>pted by Dilīpa, father of Bhagīratha, with-<BR>out success 3. 106. 38; Bhagīratha, desirous<BR>of seeking the favour of the Gaṅgā, went<BR>to the Himavant to practise austerities 3.<BR>107. 4; after one thousand years the Gaṅgā<BR>appeared before Bhagīratha in a bodily form<BR>3. 107. 14; when requested by Bhagīratha to<BR>wash the bones (शरीराणि) of the sons of<BR>Sagara so that they might go to heaven,<BR>she agreed, but first asked Bhagīratha to<BR>propitiate Śiva by तपस् so that he might<BR>agree to hold her on his head; no one else<BR>could check her speed when she descended from<BR>heaven; Bhagīratha succeeded in securing a<BR>boon from Śaṅkara to hold the Gaṅgā 3.<BR>107. 18-25; Śiva assured Bhagīratha to<BR>hold the Devanadī (Gaṅgā) when she came<BR>down from heaven; Śiva then went to the<BR>Himavant and asked Bhagīratha to request<BR>the daughter of the king of the mountains<BR>(Gaṅgā not directly named) to come down<BR>from the heaven; when Bhagīratha thought<BR>of the Gaṅgā (गङ्गां समनुचिन्तयत्<BR>3. 108. 5), the river descended from heaven<BR>on Śiva's forehead; the river became triple<BR>while flowing thence to the ocean (सा ब-<BR>भूव विसर्पन्ती त्रिधा राजन् समुद्रगा<BR>3. 108. 10); the river asked Bhagīratha to<BR>show her the way; Bhagīratha led her to the<BR>place where lay the bones (शरीऋआणि) of the<BR>sons of Sagara; after holding the Gaṅgā on<BR>his head Hara went to the Kailāsa; Bhagī-<BR>ratha having reached the ocean with the<BR>Gaṅgā filled it with the water of the river;<BR>Bhagīratha made Gaṅgā his daughter (दुहि-<BR>तृत्वे च नृपतिर् गङ्गां समनुकल्पयत्);<BR>he offered water of the Gaṅgā to the manes<BR>3. 108. 17; 12. 29. 62; Lomaśa thus told<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira how the Gaṅgā came to be Tri-<BR>pathagā (flowing in three regions-heaven,<BR>mid-region, and the earth) and how she was<BR>made to descend also to fill the ocean with<BR>water (पूरणार्थं समुद्रस्य पृथिवीम्<BR>अवतारिता) 3. 108. 2-18; the incident of the<BR>descent of the Gaṅgā on the head of Śiva also<BR>alluded to in 5. 109. 6; 6. 7. 28; 13. 27. 71, 87,<BR>89, 95; 13. 106. 26; 13. 134. 17; (ii) Other<BR>events related to Bhagīratha and the Gaṅgā:<BR>(a) Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī formerly sat on the<BR>lap of Bhagīratha while he was seated on the<BR>slope (near the river), hence she came to<BR>be known as Urvaśī (उपह्वरे निवसतो<BR>यस्याङ्के निषसाद ह । गङ्गा भागीऋअथी<BR>तस्माद् उर्वशी ह्य् अभवत् पुरा 12. 29. 61<BR>(Nī. on Bom.

6.<BR>7. 41; (c) Bhagīratha gave on the Gaṅgā<BR>a myriad of hundreds of cows (गवां<BR>शतानाम् अयुतम्) 13. 106. 37; he gave<BR>gifts (of cows ?) which would cover the<BR>entire current of the Gaṅgā (स्रोतश् च<BR>यावद् गङ्गायाश् छन्नम् आसीज् जगत्पते ।<BR>दक्षिणाभिः प्रवृत्ताभिः) 13. 106. 24;<BR>(iii) Jahnu and the Gaṅgā: The Gaṅgā<BR>became the daughter of Jahnu (दुहितृत्वम्<BR>अनुप्राप्ता गङ्गा यस्य (i. e. जह्नोः))<BR>13. 4. 3; Jahnu waited on her (जह्नुर्<BR>जाह्नविसेविता) 13. 151. 44; (iv) King<BR>Yayāti, desirous of arranging a Svayaṃvara<BR>for his daughter Mādhavī, went to a hermitage<BR>situated on the confluence of the Gaṅgā and<BR>the Yamunā; his sons Pūru and Yadu put<BR>their sister on a chariot and rushed to the<BR>same hermitage 5. 118. 1-2; the entire region<BR>between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā in the<BR>middle of the earth was given by Yayāti to<BR>his son Pūru as his kingdom (गङ्गायमु-<BR>नयोर् मध्ये कृत्स्नो ऽयं विषियस् तव ।<BR>मध्ये पृथिव्यास् त्वं राजा) 1. 82. 5;<BR>(v) A battle was fought between Haryaśva<BR>and the Haihayas, the kinsmen of Vītahavya,<BR>in the region lying between the Gaṅgā and<BR>the Yamunā; in this battle Haryaśva was<BR>killed 13. 31. 11; Divodāsa, son of Sudeva,<BR>established Vārāṇasī on the north bank of the<BR>Gaṅgā and to the south of Gomatī (to avoid<BR>the attack by the Haihayas) 13. 31. 18, 16;<BR>when, later, Pratardana, the son of Divodāsa,<BR>wanted to attack the Vaitahavyas (= Hai-<BR>hayas) he crossed the river Gaṅgā 13. 31. 35;<BR>(vi) On the river Gaṅgā, near Kanyakubja,<BR>king Gādhi married his daughter Satyavatī to<BR>Ṛcīka Bhārgava 3. 115. 17; (vii) The sage<BR>Cyavana Bhārgava once took the vow of<BR>staying in water for twelve years (उदवास-<BR>कृतारम्भो बभूव सुमहाव्रतः … वर्-<BR>षाणि द्वादश मुनिर् जलवासे धृतव्रतः)<BR>13. 50. 3-4; he became stiff like a post<BR>(स्थाणुभूतः) and after worshipping the<BR>deities entered the waters of the Gaṅgā and<BR>the Yamunā; he withstood with his head the<BR>terrific current of the two rivers; the two<BR>rivers, and those which followed them, made<BR>a प्रदक्षिणा of the sage and did not cause<BR>harm to him; the sage slept in the waters like<BR>a log of wood and then stood erect (अन्तर्<BR>जले स सुष्वाप काष्ठभूतो महामुनिः ।<BR>ततश् चोर्ध्वस्थितो धीमान् अभवद् भर-<BR>तर्षभ) 13. 50. 6-9; (viii) Sage Cyavana<BR>took his residence for some time on the bank of<BR>the river Gaṅgā to observe a व्रत 13. 53. 55;<BR>(ix) At a place not far from Kanyakubja<BR>on the bank of the Gaṅgā is the Aśvatīrtha<BR>where from the waters of the Gaṅgā arose<BR>a thousand horses having one black ear;<BR>Ṛcīka, the son of Cyavana, got them by<BR>the favour of Varuṇa 13. 4. 16-17; (x)<BR>A certain Brāhmaṇa once lived in the city<BR>Mahāpadma on the southern bank of the<BR>Gaṅgā 12. 341. 1; (xi) When Śuka was<BR>born on the mountain Meru (मेरुपृष्ठे),<BR>Gaṅgā in her original form (स्वरूपिणी)<BR>arrived there to bathe him 12. 311. 12;<BR>(xii) Once, Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin, the young son<BR>of Sṛñjaya, accompanied by his nurse, ran<BR>while playing on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;<BR>he was then attacked by Indra's वज्र in<BR>the form of a tiger 12. 31. 31; (xiii) Gau-<BR>tama and his brothers put their eldest brother<BR>Dīrghatamas in a wooden box and put it on<BR>the Gaṅgā; king Bali, who had gone to bathe<BR>in the river Gaṅgā (not named), saw the box<BR>brought to him by the current of the water<BR>1. 98. 18, 21; (xiv) When the Kṣatriyas<BR>were destroyed by Rāma Jāmadagnya, Aṅga,<BR>the son of Diviratha, was protected by Gau-<BR>tama on the bank of the Gaṅgā 12. 49. 72;<BR>(xv) Bharata, the son of Duḥṣanta, offered<BR>on different rivers a thousand horse-sacrifices<BR>of which he bound fourteen horses on the river<BR>Gaṅgā (यो बद्ध्वा … अश्वान् देवेभ्यो …<BR>गङ्गाम् अनु चतुर्दश ॥ अश्वमेधसह-<BR>स्रेण … इष्टवान् स महातेजा दौःषन्तिर्<BR>भरतः पुरा ॥ ) 12. 29. 41-42; (xvi)<BR>Bharadvāja, when he went to the Gaṅgā for<BR>bath, saw there the Apsaras Ghṛtācī who<BR>had also come there to bathe 1. 154. 2;<BR>(xvii) Vasiṣṭha turned the Gaṅgā, proceed-<BR>ing towards the Kailāsa, to the Mānasa lake;<BR>when that lake got mixed with the river,<BR>the Gaṅgā became the Sarayū 13. 140. 23-24;<BR>(xviii) Rājadharman, the son of Kaśyapa<BR>and Dākṣāyaṇī, offered to Gautama, his guest,<BR>large fishes (महामीनाः) obtained from the<BR>regions through which the river Gaṅgā flew<BR>12. 164. 4; (xix) A certain Brāhmaṇa,<BR>Kauśika by name, told the truth to the robbers<BR>about the whereabouts of the people who<BR>were afraid of them; by this act he incurred<BR>sin on the river Gaṅgā 12. 110. 8 (reference<BR>to 8. 49. 41-46 where in st. 32 Gaṅgā is<BR>not named); (xx) The following persons<BR>attained perfection (सिद्धि) on the Gaṅgā:<BR>(1) Śilavṛtti, when instructed by Siddha on<BR>the virtues of the Tripathā, worshipped the<BR>Gaṅgā according to the rites and attained<BR>perfection which was very difficult to attain;<BR>Siddha himself, after instructing Śilarati,<BR>entered the sky 13. 27. 101-102; (2) Sage<BR>Sanatkumāra attained great perfection on the<BR>Gaṅgā 3. 135. 6; (xxi) Indra, in the form<BR>of a very weak Brāhmaṇa, appeared before<BR>Yavakrī and started doing an impossible<BR>deed viz. constructing a dam in the Bhāgī-<BR>rathī by filling the Gaṅgā with sand; he<BR>poured constantly handfuls of sand in the<BR>Bhāgīrathī; when asked by Yavakrī smilingly<BR>why he was busy with this fruitless effort<BR>Indra told him that he wanted to construct<BR>a dam in the Gaṅgā so that the river can be<BR>crossed easily 3. 135. 30-36; (2) Mytho-<BR>logical: (i) Gaṅgā once went to pay a<BR>visit to Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) in his as-<BR>sembly; there her garment was displaced by<BR>the wind; King Mahābhiṣa, who happened to<BR>be there, constantly looked at her in that<BR>condition; he was therefore cursed to be born<BR>again as a human being; Gaṅgā returned<BR>from the assembly continuing to think about<BR>Mahābhīṣa; she saw the Vasus, dejected,<BR>going along the way; she asked them the<BR>cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her<BR>that they were cursed by Vasiṣṭha to be born<BR>as humans; they requested Gaṅgā to assume<BR>a human form so that she could give birth<BR>to them as humans; Gaṅgā agreed and asked<BR>them whom would they like to be their father;<BR>they chose Śaṃtanu, the son of Pratīpa;<BR>Gaṅgā also had thought of the same person,<BR>hence she would do what was dear to the king<BR>and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gaṅgā to<BR>throw them into water no sooner they were<BR>born; Gaṅgā agreed to even that request,<BR>but asked them to spare one of them so that<BR>Śaṃtanu's union with her would not be totally<BR>fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each<BR>one of them contributing one-eighth share for<BR>Gaṅgā's son; and they also told her that the<BR>son of the Gaṅgā would beget no son; having<BR>come to this agreement with the Gaṅgā<BR>the Vasus, delighted, went their way 1. 91.<BR>4-22; (ii) The lustre (तेजः 13. 84. 11)<BR>of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget<BR>through that lustre a son on the Gaṅgā for<BR>killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went<BR>to the Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and became mixed<BR>with her; as a result, Gaṅgā became pregnant;<BR>Gaṅgā could not bear the embryo, was men-<BR>tally distressed, and was in great agony;<BR>when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the<BR>Gaṅgā, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely;<BR>terrified, the Gaṅgā was unable to bear the<BR>embryo; Jāhnavī, with her body covered with<BR>lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could<BR>not contain his lustre within her; she was<BR>very much uneasy and was agitated; she<BR>would like to cast away the embryo, as she<BR>could hold it no longer, and not because of<BR>her sweet will; she was no longer her usual<BR>self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the<BR>embryo within her: as she was capable of<BR>bearing and containing the whole earth there<BR>was nothing which Gaṅgā could not achieve<BR>except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni;<BR>in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the<BR>other gods the Gaṅgā cast off the embryo on<BR>mount Meru; Gaṅgā was capable of holding<BR>an embryo, but she could not do it on this<BR>occasion as she was overcome by the lustre<BR>of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared<BR>before Agni who asked her if the delivery<BR>was happy (कच्चिद् गर्भः सुखोदयः);<BR>he asked her to describe to him the colour,<BR>the form and the lustre of the child; having<BR>described to Agni the form of his son the god-<BR>dess (देवी) Gaṅgā disappeared 13. 84. 8, 12,<BR>52-72; 9. 43 8-9 (where the embryo is said<BR>to have been cast off on the mountain Hima-<BR>vant; when the embryo was cast off that part<BR>of the mountain became of gold 9. 43. 14);<BR>the son Kumāra was first Gāṅgeya (son of<BR>Gaṅgā), then became Kārttikeya (the son of<BR>the Kṛttikās); the Gaṅgā, the best among the<BR>rivers, waited on him 9. 43. 20; when the<BR>child approached Śiva, Pārvatī, Gaṅgā and<BR>Pāvaka (Agni) each one of them wondered<BR>whom he would show his honour by going to<BR>him or her first (किं नु पूर्वम् अयं<BR>बालो गौरवाद् अभ्युपैष्यति । अपि माम् इति<BR>सर्वेषाम् तेषाम् आसीद् मनोगतम्) 9. 43.<BR>34-35; knowing their mind the child assumed<BR>four forms (ततो ऽभवच् चतुर्मूर्तिः), of<BR>which the form Naigameṣa went to the Gaṅgā<BR>9. 43. 37, 39; then all the four, Rudra, Devī,<BR>Pāvaka and the Gaṅgā, bowed down to Pitā-<BR>maha (Brahmadeva) and requested him to<BR>grant Kumāra the overlordship of all beings<BR>i. e. of the kings of all the classes of gods<BR>(आधिपत्यम्; सेनापत्यम् ददौ तस्मै<BR>सर्वभूतेषु भारत । सर्वदेवनिकायानां<BR>ये राजानः परिश्रुताः । तान् सर्वान् व्यादि-<BR>देशास्मै सर्वभूतपितामहः) 9. 43. 42,<BR>44, 48, 49; when the gods gave different gifts<BR>to Kumāra, Gaṅgā gave him a divine water<BR>vessel which was the source of the nectar<BR>(कमण्डलुं दिव्यम् अमृतोद्भवम् उत्त-<BR>मम्) 9. 45. 45; people call Kumāra diffe-<BR>rently the son of Pitamaha, or of Maheśvara,<BR>or of Umā, or of the Kṛttikās, or of the<BR>Gaṅgā 9. 45. 86; the incident is also allud-<BR>ed to in 3. 207. 4; 13. 27. 87 (इयं गाङ्गा<BR> … गुहस्य रुक्मस्य च गर्भयोषा;

Past and Mythological<BR>events: (1) King Matināra performed a<BR>sacrificial session lasting for twelve years on<BR>the bank of Sarasvatī; after the सत्र was<BR>over, Sarasvatī chose Matināra for her hus-<BR>band; a son was born to Sarasvatī, Taṃsu<BR>by name; this is recorded in a stanza describ-<BR>ing lineage (अत्रानुवंशो भवति । तंसुं<BR>सरस्वती पुत्रं मतिनाराद् अजीजनत्) 1.<BR>90. 25-28); (2) Describing past events in<BR>Kṛṣṇa's life Arjuna said that in a सत्र<BR>lasting for twelve years on Sarasvatī Kṛṣṇa<BR>discarded his upper garment, became thin,<BR>having stretched veins (अपकृष्टोत्तरासङ्गः<BR>कृशो धमनिसंततः । आसीः कृष्ण सरस्व-<BR>त्यां सत्रे द्वादशवार्षिके ॥ ) 3. 13, 13 (Nī.<BR>on 3. 12. 14; अपकृष्टोत्तरासङ्गः त्यक्तोत्त-<BR>रीयवस्त्रः); (3) Sarasvatī is one of the<BR>seven forms assumed by Gaṅgā on the moun-<BR>tain Hiraṇyaśṛṅga (6. 7. 40); these forms<BR>became famous as seven Gaṅgās in the three<BR>worlds 6. 7. 44-45, 47; (4) Trita fell down<BR>at night in a well which was not far away from<BR>Sarasvatī 9. 35. 24-25; when Trita requested<BR>gods to rescue him from the well, Sarasvatī,<BR>full of waves, leapt up and threw Trita out of<BR>the well (तत्र चोर्मिमती राजन्न् उत्पपात<BR>सरस्वती । तयोत्क्षिप्तस् त्रितस् तस्थौ) 9. 35,<BR>46; (5) Sarasvatī, in bygone days, dis-<BR>appeared due to her hatred for Śūdras and<BR>Ābhīras; the place where she disappear-<BR>ed was named by sages Vinaśana tīrtha<BR>(शूद्राभीरान् प्रति द्वेषाद् यत्र नष्टा<BR>सरस्वती … तस्मात् तद् ऋषयो नित्यं प्राहुर्<BR>विनशनेति ह ॥ ) 9. 36. 1-2; (6) Sarasvatī,<BR>flowing towards the east, returned from a<BR>certain तीर्थ to the west out of her regard<BR>for the sages living in the Naimiṣa forest;<BR>formerly, in the Kṛta age, many sages from<BR>the Naimiṣa forest, after completing सत्र<BR>of twelve years, flocked to Sarasvatī for<BR>pilgrimage (तीर्थकारणात्); on account of<BR>their large numbers the तीर्थस् on the south<BR>bank of Sarasvatī appeared like cities<BR>(ऋषीणां बहुलत्वात् तु सरस्वत्या विशां<BR>पते । तीर्थानि नगरायन्ते कूले वै दक्षिणे<BR>तदा ॥ ); these sages resorted to the bank<BR>of Sarasvatī as far as the Samantapañcaka<BR>on account of their love for तीर्थस् (तीर्थ-<BR>लोभात्); due to the fires of their अग्नीहोत्रस्<BR>the river shone (अशोभत सरिच्छ्रेष्ठा);<BR>the sages, dwelling near Sarasvatī, beautified<BR>the river as do gods the Ganges (शोभयन्-<BR>तः सरिच्छ्रेष्ठाम् गङ्गाम् इव दिवौकसः);<BR>when other sages arrived there to perform a<BR>सत्र they found no place in Kurukṣetra;<BR>then Sarasvatī showed herself to the despon-<BR>dent sages (ततस् तम् ऋषिसंघातं निरा-<BR>शं चिन्तयान्वितम् । दर्शयाम् आस राजेन्द्र<BR>तेषाम् अर्थे सरस्वती); the river created<BR>for them many bowers, returned (ततः<BR>कुञ्जान् बहून् कृत्वा संनिवृत्ता सरिद्वरा),<BR>and again flowed towards the west thinking<BR>“I shall not render the arrival of the sages<BR>futile; now I shall go my way”; this<BR>is a great wonder that the river perfor-<BR>med (भूयः प्रतीच्यभिमुखी सुस्राव<BR>सरितां वरा ॥ अमोघा गमनं (अमोघा-<BR>गमनम् ?) कृत्वा तेषां भूयो व्रजाम्य्<BR>अहम् । इत्य् अद्भुतं महच् चक्रे ततो<BR>राजन् महानदी) 9. 36. 35-53; (7) When<BR>Maṅkaṇaka, who was observing chastity<BR>(कौमारब्रह्मचारिणः) saw by chance<BR>a woman taking bath in Sarasvatī his seed<BR>fell into water; when it was collected in a<BR>jar by the sage, the seed got divided into<BR>seven parts; from it were born seven seers,<BR>from whom sprang the Maruts (तत्रर्षयः<BR>सप्त जाता जज्ञिरे मरुतां गणाः । … एवम्<BR>एते समुत्पन्ना मरुतां जनयिष्णवः)<BR>9. 37. 29-32 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 38. 37<BR>(एतेषां तपसा मरुतो ऽदित्याम् उत्पन्ना इति<BR>कल्पान्तरविषयो ऽयम् अर्थः); (8) The<BR>Brāhmaṇa Ruṣaṅgu, when he decided to<BR>give up his body in old age, asked his sons<BR>to carry him to Pṛthūdaka, a तीर्थ on<BR>Sarasvatī; when he was carried to the river<BR>by his sons, he took bath there (आप्लुतः)<BR>and, knowing the qualities of the तीर्थ,<BR>told his sons: “one who gives up his body<BR>on the northern bank of Sarasvatī will not<BR>have to worry about iminent death” (नैनं<BR>श्वोमरणं तपेत्) 9. 38. 24-29, (9) Baka<BR>Dālbhya, when insulted by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, son<BR>of Vicitravīrya (9. 40. 1; probably different<BR>from the son of Ambikā and the father of the<BR>Kauravas), kindled fire at a desolate तीर्थ on<BR>Sarasvatī (अवकीर्णे सरस्वत्यास् तीर्थे प्र-<BR>ज्वाल्य पावकम् 9. 40. 12; Nī., however, who<BR>reads अवाकीर्णम् takes it as the name of a<BR>तीर्थ: अवाकीर्णं नाम दाल्भ्यसेवितं तीर्-<BR>थं जगाम Bom. Ed. 9. 41. 1) and started<BR>giving offerings of flesh of dead animals;<BR>as a result the kingdom of Dhṛtarāṣṭra began<BR>to waste away; he was therefore advised to<BR>propitiate Baka in a bower in the water of<BR>Sarasvatī (अपां कुञ्जे सरस्वत्यास् तं<BR>प्रसादय पार्थिव) and request Baka to<BR>forgive him for his fault 9. 40. 10-21; (also<BR>see No. 27 below); (10) For the sacrifice<BR>of Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, Sarasvatī brought<BR>in her currents clarified butter and milk<BR>(घृतं पयश् च सुस्राव); in that sacri-<BR>fice, Sarasvatī fulfilled the wishes of Brāh-<BR>maṇas by producing many juices (?) in<BR>accordance with their wishes (यत्र यत्र<BR>हि यो विप्रो यान् यान् कामान् अभीप्सति ।<BR>तत्र तत्र सरिच्छ्रेष्ठा ससर्ज सुबहून्<BR>रसान्) 9. 40. 30, 33; (11) Viśvāmitra<BR>practised severe austerities on an excellent<BR>तीर्थ (not named) of Sarasvatī and became<BR>a Brāhmaṇa 9. 39. 23, 28-29; the आश्रम<BR>of Vasiṣṭha was at Sthāṇutīrtha on the<BR>eastern bank of Sarasvatī and that of<BR>Viśvāmitra on the western bank; at the<BR>तीर्थ Vasiṣṭhāpavāha, Viśvāmitra was able<BR>to displace Vasiṣṭha with the help of severe<BR>austerities (वसिष्ठं चालयाम् आस तप-<BR>सोग्रेण) 9. 41. 4, 8; Viśvāmitra wanted<BR>Sarasvatī to bring Vasiṣṭha to him swiftly<BR>so that he could kill him (Vasiṣṭha); Viśvā-<BR>mitra therefore thought of Sarasvatī; she<BR>appeared before him, trembling with fear, and<BR>asked him what she might do for him; Viśvā-<BR>mitra told the river what he wanted her to do;<BR>hearing that Sarasvatī was pained; she just<BR>stood there all the while shaking with fear;<BR>Viśvāmitra asked her again to bring Vasiṣṭha<BR>quickly to him; she was worried what<BR>to do as she was afraid of the curses<BR>of both the sages; she went to Vasiṣṭha<BR>and informed him what Viśvāmitra's desire<BR>was; Vasiṣṭha saw her pale and lean and<BR>told her to carry him to Viśvāmitra and save<BR>herself from the latter's curse; hearing that<BR>Sarasvatī reflected on what she might<BR>do which would turn out beneficial to<BR>Vasiṣṭha as he had been merciful to her;<BR>when she saw on the other bank Viśvāmitra<BR>engaged in giving offerings she thought that<BR>to be the right moment to act swiftly (सरस्-<BR>वत्य् अभ्यचिन्तयत् । इदम् अन्तरम् इत्य् एव<BR>9. 41. 26-27); she washed away a part of<BR>her bank on the side of Vasiṣṭha so that he<BR>was carried on her current to the आश्रम of<BR>Viśvāmitra; while he was being thus carried<BR>Vasiṣṭha praised Sarasvatī (Sarasvatī's praise<BR>9. 41. 29-31); Sarasvatī informed Viśvāmitra<BR>that she had brought Vasiṣṭha; Viśvāmitra<BR>began to look for a weapon to kill Vasiṣṭha;<BR>being afraid of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa<BR>Sarasvatī carried Vasiṣṭha back to the eastern<BR>bank (ब्रह्महत्याभयान् नदी । अपोवाह<BR>वसिष्ठं तु प्राचीं दिशम् अतन्द्रिता 9. 41.<BR>34); she thus did what both the sages asked<BR>her to do, but Viśvāmitra was deceived;<BR>enraged, he cursed the river to flow with<BR>blood; as a result Sarasvatī flew with water<BR>mixed with blood for a year; the sages, gods,<BR>Gandharvas and Apsarases were excessively<BR>pained to see Sarasvatī in that condition; this<BR>is how the तीर्थ Vasiṣṭhāpavāha came into<BR>existance 9. 41. 11-39; when Sarasvatī<BR>carried blood with water in her current,<BR>Rākṣasas came there and were happy to drink<BR>blood from the river water; once, some sages,<BR>while visiting the तीर्थस्, came to Vasiṣṭhā-<BR>pavāha they saw the Rākṣasas drinking<BR>blood from the river; they decided to do<BR>something to save the river; they invited<BR>Sarasvatī and found out from her the cause<BR>of the disturbed condition of the तीर्थ<BR>(कारणं ब्रूहि कल्याणि किमर्थं ते<BR>ह्रदो ह्य् अयम् । एवम् आकुलतां यातः<BR>9. 42. 9); on hearing the cause, they decided<BR>to free the river from the curse; by their<BR>mere word Sarasvatī returned to her normal<BR>condition and her water was as placid as<BR>before (तेषां तु वचनाद् एव प्रकृतिस्था<BR>सरस्वती । प्रसन्नसलिला जज्ञे यथा पूर्-<BR>वम् तथैव हि 9. 42. 13); the excellent river<BR>shone as before; since the river water was<BR>normal again the Rākṣasas were afflicted by<BR>hunger and they requested the sages to relieve<BR>them from that condition; the sages praised<BR>the river and urged her to relieve the Rākṣasas<BR>from their condition; knowing what the sages<BR>wanted Sarasvatī brought to her current the<BR>river Aruṇā (अरुणाम् आनयाम् आस स्वां<BR>तनुम्); bathing in that river the Rākṣasas<BR>abandoned their bodies and went to heaven<BR>9. 42. 1-25; (12) While Dadhīca was<BR>giving offerings to gods on the bank of Saras-<BR>vatī (तस्य तर्पयतो देवान् सरस्वत्याम्<BR>9. 50. 8), the Apsaras Alambusā, sent by<BR>Indra to disturb the austerities of Dadhīca,<BR>approached him; seeing her divine form the<BR>seed of Dadhīca spilled into water of Sara-<BR>svatī; the river held it in her womb as she<BR>desired to have a son and also because the seed<BR>might not be wasted (कुक्षौ चाप्य् अदधत् …<BR>तद् रेतः … पुत्रहेतोर् महानदी 9. 50. 10;<BR>न विनाशम् इदं गच्छेत् त्वत्तेज इति निश्च-<BR>यात् 9. 50. 14); when Sarasvatī delivered the<BR>child at proper time she took him to Dadhīca;<BR>seeing Dadhīca seated in the assembly of<BR>sages she handed over the child to him saying<BR>it was his son whom she bore out of her<BR>devotion to the sage (ब्रह्मर्षे तव पुत्रो<BR>ऽयं त्वद्भक्त्या धारितो मया 9. 50. 12);<BR>Dadhīca accepted the child and was very much<BR>delighted; he then gave the following boon<BR>to Sarasvatī: “all gods, manes, Gandharvas<BR>and Apsarases will be satisfied when they<BR>receive offerings of your water (तृप्तिं या-<BR>स्यन्ति सुभगे तर्प्यमाणास् तवाम्भसा 9.<BR>50. 17); the sage then praised the great river<BR>(9. 50. 19-20); he declared that this her<BR>son will be known as Sārasvata after the<BR>mother's name (तवैव नाम्ना प्रथितः<BR>पुत्रस् ते लोकभावनः 9. 50. 21); he also<BR>declared that by his grace Sarasvatī would<BR>be the holiest of all holy rivers (पुण्याभ्यश्<BR>च सरिद्भ्यस् त्वं सदा पुण्यतमा शुभे ।<BR>भविष्यसि महाभागे मत्प्रसादात् सरस्-<BR>वति 9. 50. 23); when praised by the sage and<BR>having received a boon from him Sarasvatī<BR>went away taking her son with her 9. 50.<BR>5-24; (13) Once there was drought lasting<BR>for twelve years; when Sārasvata, like other<BR>people, wanted to leave the place and go else-<BR>where in search of food, Sarasvatī told him<BR>not to leave the place; she assured him to<BR>provide food to him in the form of excellent<BR>fish; Sārasvata therefore lived there; he ate<BR>the food offered by the river and preserved the<BR>Vedas 9. 50. 36-38; (14) Bharata, son of<BR>Duḥṣyanta and Śakuntalā, bound twenty<BR>horses for sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī<BR>(सरस्वतीं विंशतिं च) 12. 29. 41; (15)<BR>Gārgya satisfied Śiva by offering a mental<BR>sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī (सर्स्वत्यास्<BR>तटे तुष्टो मनोयज्ञेन पाण्डव); Śiva<BR>then gave him wonderful knowledge of time<BR>(कालज्ञानं ममाद्भुतम्), a thousand<BR>sons, equal to Gārgya, versed in the exposition<BR>of Brahman (तुल्यं मम सहस्रं तु<BR>सुतानां ब्रह्मवादिनाम्), and very long<BR>life to him and to his sons 13. 18. 25-26;<BR>(16) Nahuṣa invited Agastya, who was<BR>then on the bank of Sarasvatī, to come to<BR>him and draw his carriage (वाहनायाजुहाव<BR>सः । द्रुतं सरस्वतीकूलात्) 13. 103. 12;<BR>(17) Utathya, angered at the abduction<BR>of his wife by Varuṇa, began to drink up<BR>water everywhere, compelled the ocean to<BR>recede and asked Sarasvatī: “Be invisible<BR>in a desert land; when deserted by you let<BR>the land be unholy” (अदृश्या गच्छ भीरु<BR>त्वं सरस्वति मरुं प्रति । अपुण्य एष<BR>भवतु देशस् त्यक्तस् त्वया शुभे) 13. 139.<BR>25-26; (18) Sarasvatī was one of the rivers<BR>seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly of the Bāla<BR>(3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186.<BR>96; (19) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana<BR>the origin of the Saptasārasvata tīrtha;<BR>Vaiśaṃpāyana then began the narration of<BR>a past event in which Sarasvatī, when invited<BR>for a sacrifice at different places, appeared<BR>there under different names 9. 37. 1, 3-4; (i)<BR>When Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) thought of<BR>Sarasvatī she first appeared as Suprabhā at<BR>Puṣkara to make the sacrifice of Pitāmaha<BR>on this earth highly fruitful (महाफलः);<BR>Sarasvatī thus showed her respect for Pitāmaha<BR>(पितामहं मानयन्तीम्) 9. 37. 11-14;<BR>(ii) When Sarasvatī was thought of by the<BR>sages performing a सत्र at Naimiṣa forest<BR>she appeared there as Kāñcanākṣī to help the<BR>sages (सहायार्थं महात्मनाम्); she was<BR>honoured by the sages (पूजिता) 9. 37. 15-18;<BR>(iii) When she appeared for the sacrifice of<BR>Gaya among the people of Gayā (गयेषु),<BR>sages called her Viśālā 9. 37. 20; (iv) In<BR>the sacrifice of Auddālaki in the northern Ko-<BR>salas when she was thought of by Auddālaka<BR>the river appeared there for him (आजगाम<BR>सरिच्छ्रेठा तं देशम् ऋषिकारणात्) under<BR>the name Manohradā (Mānasahradā in 9. 37.<BR>4) since she was carried there by the sages<BR>through the agency of their mind (सा हि<BR>तैर् मनसा हृता); the river was honoured<BR>there by the sages (पूज्यमाना मुनिगणैः)<BR>9. 37. 21-23; (v) In the Ṛṣabhadvīpa the<BR>river appeared with the name Suveṇu 9. 37.<BR>24; (vi) In the sacrifice of Kuru at<BR>Kurukṣetra. when invoked by Vasiṣṭha, the<BR>river Sarasvatī appeared with the name Ogha-<BR>vatī 9. 37. 24-25; (vii) In the sacrifice<BR>of Dakṣa at Gaṅgādvāra the river appear-<BR>ed as Vimalodā 9. 37. 26 (Vimalodakā<BR>9. 37. 4); when Brahman offered a sacri-<BR>fice again he called the river back on the<BR>Himavant mountain; the तीर्थ where all<BR>the seven forms of the river got united<BR>became famous as Saptasārasvata 9. 37. 26-<BR>28; (20) When the chariot of Śiva was<BR>got ready for his fight with Asuras fighting<BR>from the Tripuras the Mahānadīs became<BR>its hind parts (जङ्घास् तस्य महानदीः)<BR>8. 24. 69 (Sarasvatī could be one of these<BR>‘big rivers’;

(14) Leaving Arun-<BR>dhatī behind at the Badarapācana tīrtha the<BR>seven sages went to Himavant; while they<BR>obtained their livelihood in a forest on Hima-<BR>vant, there occurred a severe drought lasting<BR>for twelve years; Mahādeva told the seven<BR>sages that the merit which they had acquired<BR>by their austerities on Himavant (हिमवत्-<BR>पृष्ठे) was not equal to the merit of Arun-<BR>dhatī's austerities 9. 47. 28, 30, 41;

Vaiśampāyana then<BR>told about the curse of the sages, Viśvā-<BR>mitra and others, to the effect that an iron<BR>pestle would be born to Sāmba for the des-<BR>truction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; accord-<BR>ingly Sāmba gave birth to a large pestle of<BR>the size of a किंकर (shaft of a chariot ?)<BR>(वृष्ण्यन्धकविनाशाय मुसलम् घोरम्<BR>आयसम् । … साम्बो ऽयं जनयिष्यति ॥ …<BR>साम्बो मुसलं तद् असूत वै । वृष्ण्यन्-<BR>धकविनाशाय किंकरप्रतिमं महत्)<BR>16. 2. 8, 15 (however, Nī. on Bom.

also whitish pigeons having red<BR>feet, goaded by Kāla, moved over their<BR>houses; when the conch Pāñcajanya was<BR>sounded in their houses, asses of harsh<BR>voice brayed in response (एवं प्रयतमा-<BR>नानां वृष्णीनाम् अन्धकैः सह । कालो<BR>गृहाणि सर्वेषाम् परिचक्राम नित्यशः ॥ )<BR>16. 3. 1;

Dhṛtarāṣṭra was curious to<BR>know how the Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas who,<BR>armed and in battle-arrays (व्यूढानीकाः<BR>प्रहारिणः) fought with Droṇa when they<BR>attacked him (7. 158. 13); when, Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira after the death of Ghaṭotkaca started<BR>to fight with Kauravas, Pāñcālas armed<BR>for battle (दंशिताः) beat भेरिस् and<BR>blew conches 7. 158. 50; Droṇa vowed<BR>that he would take off his armour only<BR>after he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 160. 12;<BR>towards the end of the night war, Droṇa<BR>divided his army into two parts and,<BR>led by Duryodhana, attacked Pāñcālas;<BR>they were specifically afflicted by the arrows<BR>of Droṇa; yet, although suffering from<BR>excessive pain, Pāñcālas continued to<BR>fight (पाञ्चालास् तु विशेषेण द्रोणसायक-<BR>पीडिताः । समसज्जन्त राजेन्द्र समरे<BR>भृशवेदनाः) 7. 161. 3, 28; when Droṇa<BR>killed Virāṭa, Drupada, and other warriors<BR>of Pāñcālas, Dhṛṣṭadyumna cursed the<BR>Pāñcāla warriors who would let Droṇa<BR>remain alive or turn away from him;<BR>Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa, but they<BR>could not even look at Droṇa although<BR>they tried, protected as he was by Duryo-<BR>dhana and others (यतमानापि पाञ्चाला<BR>न शेकुः परिवीक्षितुम्) 7. 161. 35-37, 38,<BR>40; (53) On the fifteenth day, when the<BR>large armies of Kauravas and Pāñcālas<BR>clashed with one another, everything<BR>was in turmoil and nothing was quite<BR>clear (आविग्नम् अभवत् सर्वम् … न<BR>प्राज्ञायत किंचन); in the raised dust<BR>it was difficult to know who were Kaura-<BR>veyas and who Pāñcālas 7. 162. 22, 27-28;<BR>during the duel between Karṇa and Bhīma,<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira addressed the chief heroes of<BR>Pāñcālas and urged them to go and help the<BR>chief warriors of Pāṇḍavas (पाञ्चालानां<BR>नरव्याघ्रान् … तत्र गच्छत यत्रैते<BR>युध्यन्ते मामका रथाः); Pāñcālas, thus<BR>urged, divided their army into four parts<BR>(चतुर्धा वाहिनीं कृत्वा): a part hit<BR>Droṇa with arrows; others, led by Bhīma,<BR>covered him from another side (पाञ्चा-<BR>लास् त्व् एकतो द्रोणम् अभ्यघ्नन् बहुभिः<BR>शरैः । भीमसेनपुरोगाश् च एकतः पर्य-<BR>वारयन् ॥ ); Arjuna was urged to separate<BR>Kurus from Droṇa; then Pāñcālas would<BR>kill Droṇa whose protectors were slain; but<BR>Droṇa attacked Pāñcālas and killed them;<BR>however, they continued to attack Droṇa;<BR>as they were getting killed a fearful sound<BR>was raised by them; when Pāñcālas were<BR>thus getting killed, Pāṇḍavas were afraid<BR>and they lost hope of victory (वध्य-<BR>मानेषु संग्रामे पाञ्चालेषु॥।पाण्डवान्<BR>भयम् आविशत् । … नाशंसुर् विजयं तदा ॥ )<BR>7. 164. 48-54, 56-58, 60-63; after the<BR>false news of Aśvatthāman's death twenty<BR>thousand Pāñcāla principal heroes (नर-<BR>र्षभाः) showered arrows from all sides on<BR>Droṇa; he then used ब्रह्मास्त्र to kill<BR>Pāñcālas; with that missile he cut off their<BR>heads and large arms adorned with gold<BR>ornaments (तथैव परिघाकारान् बाहून्<BR>कनकभूषणान्) and killed twenty thou-<BR>sand Pāñcāla chariot-fighters (विंशति-<BR>साहस्रान् पाञ्चालानां रथव्रजान्) 7. 164.<BR>78-83; that day Kauravas, led by Droṇa,<BR>had started fighting only with Pāñcālas<BR>(पाञ्चालैर् एव केवलैः), and when Droṇa<BR>released the ब्रह्मास्त्र, especially Pāñcālas<BR>were killed (पाञ्चालाश् च विशेषतः । … व्यन-<BR>शन्); when their armies were thus thrashed,<BR>Pāñcālas, (though) angered, turned away<BR>from battle (अमर्षवशम् आपन्नाः पाञ्चाला<BR>विमुखाभवन्) 7. 165. 98, 100-101, 104;<BR>Droṇa killed hosts of chariot-fighters of<BR>Pāñcālas but was killed 8. 4. 5; (54) After<BR>the death of Droṇa, Aśvatthāman assured<BR>Duryodhana that he would try to kill<BR>Pāñcālas by all sorts of means, whether<BR>soft or harsh (सर्वोपायाइर् … कर्मणा<BR>येन तेनेह मृदुना दारुणेन वा); only<BR>after killing Pāñcālas he would have peace<BR>of mind; he would force Pāñcālas to run<BR>away by the use of Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 166.<BR>28-29, 52; Sahadeva, in order to pacify<BR>Sātyaki, told him that the Pāṇḍavas had<BR>no allies other than Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and<BR>Pāñcālas; similarly the Pāñcālas had no<BR>allies other than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7.<BR>169. 48, 50; when, after the death of Droṇa,<BR>Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Pāñcālas became<BR>ready to fight, Aśvatthāman aimed his<BR>Nārāyaṇāstra against the Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Pāñcālas; Yudhiṣṭhira, afraid of the effects<BR>produced by the अस्त्र, asked Dhṛṣṭadyu-<BR>mna to run away with Pāñcāla army; he<BR>also remembered that Pāñcālas. led by<BR>Satyajit and making effort for his victory,<BR>were totally destroyed by Droṇa (पाञ्चालाः<BR>सत्यजिन्मुखाः । कुर्वाणा मज्जये यत्नं<BR>समूला विनिपातिताः) 7. 170. 10, 15, 26, 34;<BR>Duryodhana urged Aśvatthāman to use<BR>Nārāyaṇāstra again when Pāficālas, wishing<BR>victory, had steadied themselves (व्यवस्थिता<BR>हि पाञ्चालाः पुनर् एव जयैषिणः); Aśva-<BR>tthāman told him his inability to do that<BR>but he forced Pāñcālas to run away wound-<BR>ing them with arrows; when Aśvatthāman<BR>succeeded in killing many prominent<BR>(Pāñcāla) heroes on the side of Pāṇḍavas<BR>he blew his large conch with delight;<BR>hearing that all Pāñcālas, and even Bhīma,<BR>ran in all directions leaving Dhṛṣṭadyumna<BR>behind 7. 171. 25, 45, 67; (55) Saṃjaya,<BR>summarizing the events between the death<BR>of Droṇa and that of Karṇa, told Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra that Duryodhana assured his army<BR>that they would be witnesses to the heroism<BR>of Karṇa and Aśvatthāman against the<BR>Pāñcālas; Karṇa killed and afflicted many<BR>Pāñcālas, but was ultimately killed by<BR>Arjuna 8. 2. 15, 18, 20; 8. 5. 30; Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had once be-<BR>fore defeated Pāñcālas and made them pay<BR>tribute (अजैषीत् … पाञ्चालांश् च … चक्रे<BR>बलिभृतः पुरा) 8. 5. 18-20 (reference<BR>to Karṇa's conquests before the Vaiṣṇava<BR>sacrifice of Duryodhana 3. 241. 29, 32; 3.<BR>App. I. 24. 28-34); (56) On the sixteenth<BR>day, Duryodhana requested Karṇa to lead<BR>the Kaurava army because when Pāñcālas<BR>would see him they would run away;<BR>Pāṇḍavas together with Pāñcālas would be<BR>disheartened on seeing Karṇa ready to<BR>fight (पाण्डवा गतचेतसः … पाञ्चालैः<BR>सह); the bards urged Karṇa to kill<BR>Pāñcālas and bring victory to Kauravas;<BR>they also said that Pāñcālas would not be<BR>able to withstand Karṇa ready with his<BR>arms 8. 6. 30-31, 40, 42; Pāñcālas and<BR>others rushed at the Kaurava army; their<BR>chariot-fighters, elephant-riders and impor-<BR>tant foot-soldiers, delighted, danced and<BR>laughed making different sounds (नाना-<BR>विधरवैर् हृष्टा नृत्यन्ति च हसन्ति च)<BR>8. 8. 19-20; Karṇa put to death twenty<BR>Pāñcāla chariot-fighters along with their<BR>horses and charioteers and felled down<BR>their banners; he also killed many other<BR>Pāñcālas; then Pāñcāla princes (? पाञ्चाल-<BR>पुत्राश् च) attacked Karṇa 8. 16. 16, 22-23;<BR>heroes from the east and south, skilled<BR>in elephant-warfare, showered arrows,<BR>तोमरस् and नाराचस् on Pāñcālas; Pāñcā-<BR>las, with sharp weapons, surrounded the<BR>elephants and showered arrows on them;<BR>they covered Nakula to protect him from<BR>those who were fighting from elephants;<BR>Karṇa, after defeating Nakula, turned<BR>towards Pāñcālas; Pāṇḍavas raised a loud<BR>cry seeing Karṇa approach Pāñcāla<BR>chariot-fighters (दृष्ट्वा सेनापतिं यान्तं<BR>पाञ्चालानां रथव्रजान् 8. 17. 99); their<BR>chariots then were carried away (by horses)<BR>with or without the charioteers and<BR>their axles broken; those Pāñcāla महा-<BR>रथस् who survived began to run away;<BR>Karṇa, showering arrows, persecuted Pāñ-<BR>cālas whose armours and banners were<BR>broken and tormented them with arrows 8.<BR>17. 7, 21, 98-99, 101, 119-120; Ulūka, after<BR>defeating Yuyutsu, turned towards Pāñcālas<BR>striking them with arrows 8. 18. 11; when<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira fought a duel with Duryo-<BR>dhana, Pāñcālas attacked Kauravas making<BR>sounds (क्ष्वेडाः किलकिलाशाब्दाः) and<BR>striking thousands of तूर्यस्; men fought<BR>against men, elephants against elephants,<BR>chariots against chariot-fighters and horses<BR>against horse-riders; those duels were for<BR>a while pleasing to watch (द्वन्द्वान्य् आसन्<BR>महाराज प्रेक्षणीयानि संयुगे; मुहूर्-<BR>तम् एव तद् युद्धम् आसीन् मधुरदर्श-<BR>नम्); all fought the battle according to the<BR>rules; nobody struck the opponent from<BR>behind (अन्योन्यं समरे जघ्नुर् योध-<BR>व्रतम् अनुष्ठिताः । न हि ते समरं चक्रुः<BR>पृष्थतो वै कथंचन ॥ ) 8. 19. 45-49;<BR>but later the battle was fought disregarding<BR>the proper norms; the battle described<BR>in 8. 19. 49 ff.; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas 8. 19.<BR>74; (57) On the seventeenth day, Duryo-<BR>dhana wanted Karṇa and Śalya together<BR>to kill Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas and<BR>Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; Karṇa asked Śalya to<BR>drive his chariot to Pāñcālas and others;<BR>either he would kill them or they would<BR>kill him; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa that<BR>the banners and the chariots of Pāñcālas<BR>were making sound (ध्वजाः कणकणा-<BR>यन्ते … सपताका रथाश् चापि पाञ्चालानाम्)<BR>8. 31. 51; a fierce battle broke out between<BR>Pāñcālas and Kauravas; Duryodhana<BR>protected Karṇa fighting with Pāñcālas and<BR>other heroes; Karṇa rushed towards<BR>Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Pāñcālas who rushed<BR>at him; Karṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla<BR>warriors with equal number of arrows;<BR>hosts of Pāñcāla chariot-fighters then<BR>surrounded Karṇa; Karṇa killed with five<BR>arrows five Pāñcāla prominent warriors viz.<BR>Bhānudeva, Citrasena, Senābindu, Tapana<BR>and Śūrasena; then there was a loud cry<BR>of anger among the Pāñcālas (हाहाकारो<BR>महान् आसीत् पाञ्चालानां महाहवे); but<BR>Pāñcālas, equipped (दंशिताः), attacked<BR>Karṇa 8. 32. 15, 20, 25-26, 33, 35-38,<BR>43; they checked the advance of Karṇa; he<BR>could not break through their resistance<BR>to reach Yudhiṣṭhira; when he reached<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira and defeated him the latter<BR>turned back and Pāñcālas followed him 8.<BR>33. 7, 9, 15, 41; Pāñcālas and others gathered<BR>together and, disregarding the terrible fear<BR>of death (त्यक्त्वा मृत्युभयं घोरम्),<BR>attacked Aśvatthāman 8. 39. 10; Karṇa<BR>killed Pāñcālas by thousands 8. 40. 4-5;<BR>when he attacked them, no one of them<BR>turned back; they attacked Karṇa from all<BR>sides; he moved among them unafraid;<BR>he made hosts of their chariot-fighters run<BR>away 8. 40. 42, 44, 58-59; Karṇa, single-<BR>handed, announcing his name (विश्राव्य<BR>नाम) killed many Pāñcālas, respected by<BR>brave (शूरसंमताः); onlookers like<BR>Saṃjaya felt that no Pāñcāla warrior<BR>would be allowed to live by Karṇa; Karṇa,<BR>while blowing away Pāñcālas (विधमन्),<BR>rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira; he, alone,<BR>fought with Cedis, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas<BR>8. 40. 62-64, 68; Pāñcālas, led by Dhṛṣṭa-<BR>dyumna, followed Bhīma and returned to<BR>battle (तम् एते ऽनु निवर्तन्ते) 8. 41. 3;<BR>Karṇa, alone, held back Pāñcālas and<BR>others; when Pāñcālas saw that Dhṛṣṭa-<BR>dyumna was saved by Arjuna, they, consi-<BR>dering themselves victorious, sounded<BR>musical instruments by thousands and<BR>made loud roar 8. 42. 32, 54-55; Pāñcālas<BR>quickly rallied round Yudhiṣṭhira to help<BR>him; in the presence of Pāñcālas and<BR>others, Karṇa broke the banner on the<BR>chariot of Yudhiṣṭhira; he destroyed the<BR>army of Pāṇḍavas (including Pāñcālas);<BR>Pāñcālas started to run away; Karṇa had<BR>already defeated them; it was felt that Karṇa<BR>attacking them would extirpate Pāñcālas<BR>(समुच्छेत्स्यति); but when Bhīma appear-<BR>ed, Pāñcālas started killing Kaurava army<BR>8. 43. 3, 22-29, 31-32, 50, 53; chariot-<BR>fighters (रथिनः) of Kauravas, struck<BR>by Pāñcālas, fell down from their chariots;<BR>Pāñcālas returned towards the army of<BR>Kauravas (धार्तराष्ट्रान्) and killed those<BR>who, riding elephants, horses and chariots,<BR>were fighting; supported by Bhīma, Pāñcālas<BR>disregarded their lives and crushed their<BR>enemies; while killing their adversaries,<BR>they blew conches and shouted; when the<BR>Pāñcālas were thus killing the Kaurava<BR>army, Kṛpa, Karṇa and other heroes made<BR>great attempt to stop their attack 8. 43.<BR>59-65; but Pāñcālas, enraged and feeling<BR>victorious, attacked the Kaurava army<BR>from all sides 8. 44. 8; Karṇa assured Śalya<BR>that he would kill all Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-<BR>vas and then released his Bhārgavāstra<BR>against them; Pāñcālas, afflicted by that<BR>missile, raised a loud cry (हाहाकारो महान्<BR>आसीत् पाञ्चालानाम् … ); getting killed by the<BR>missile Pāñcālas were all confused (तत्र<BR>तत्र व्यमुह्यन्त) 8. 45. 32, 37, 41; Karṇa<BR>cut off the banner of Yudhiṣṭhira and killed<BR>his two side-charioteers in the presence of<BR>Pāñcālas (हतौ च पार्ष्णिसारथी) 8.<BR>46. 12; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: all Pāñcālas,<BR>under Arjuna's guidance, were ready to<BR>fight; protected by him, they had killed<BR>enemies; Bhīṣma had earlier killed Pāñcālas;<BR>Arjuna now should kill the enemies, viz.<BR>the five great warriors Aśvatthāman, Kṛta-<BR>varman, Karṇa, Śalya and Kṛpa, so that<BR>Pāñcālas might rejoice (अद्य मोदन्तु पाञ्-<BR>चाला … ); Pāñcālas wished to rescue Pāṇḍa-<BR>vas (पाण्डवान् उज्जिहीर्षवः) but were fleeing<BR>as they got killed by Karṇa; they were as<BR>good as under the control of Karṇa (विद्धि<BR>कर्णवशं गतान्); Pāñcālas, struck by<BR>Karṇa, raised a fierce cry (श्रूयते निनदो<BR>घोरस् … ); when they faced Bhīṣma, they<BR>never turned back (नासन् पराङ्मुखाः);<BR>they would not turn back due to fear of<BR>Karṇa; Karṇa was killing the attacking<BR>Pāñcālas by hundreds — Pāñcālas who<BR>gave lives for their friends; Pāñcālas were<BR>fleeing in all directions (एते चरन्ति पाञ्चाला<BR>दिक्षु सर्वासु) as they faced the irresisti-<BR>ble अस्त्र of Karṇa obtained by him from<BR>Bhārgava (8. 51. 101); if Karṇa was<BR>neglected (उपेक्षितः कर्णो … ); he would<BR>kill Pāñcālas and the rest 8. 51. 5-6, 12, 27,<BR>54, 91-96, 98-100, 104, 106; Arjuna saw<BR>Pāñcāla army running away; he desired to<BR>pay back the debt he owed to Pāñcālas<BR>by killing Karṇa (पाञ्चालानां च माधव ।<BR>अद्यानृण्यं गमिष्यामि) 8. 52. 5, 28; as<BR>desired by Karṇa, Śalya drove his chariot<BR>towards Pāñcālas; entering their army,<BR>Śalya stopped Karṇa's chariot wherever<BR>he desired; seeing Karṇa's chariot, the<BR>Pāñcālas trembled (त्रस्ता आसन्); when<BR>Karṇa killed Pāñcālas a loud cry arose<BR>among them (तत्राक्रन्दो महान् आसीत्);<BR>although the great Pāñcāla archers were<BR>defeated, they returned to fight till death<BR>(मृत्युं कृत्वा निवर्तनम्); Karṇa killed<BR>twentyfive chariot-fighters and more than<BR>hundred horse-riders; the wonderful<BR>heroism of Pāñcālas was witnessed by<BR>others when Pāñcālas did not abandon<BR>fighting although they were getting killed<BR>(तत्राद्भुतम् अपश्याम पाञ्चालानां<BR>पराक्रमम् । वध्यमानापि कर्णेन<BR>नाजहू रणमूर्धनि ॥ ); two sons (not<BR>named) of Karṇa killed strong Pāñcālas<BR>8. 56. 8-11, 23, 31, 47, 49, 54, 56; but<BR>at one stage Pāñcālas, afraid of Karṇa,<BR>began to flee (एते द्रवन्ति पाञ्चालाः कर्णात्<BR>त्रस्ता … ) 8. 57. 3; Karṇa rushed towards<BR>Pāñcālas in spite of Arjuna (पश्यतः<BR>सव्यसाचिनः); he killed Pāñcālas by releas-<BR>ing thousands of arrows; there was fierce<BR>battle of Karṇa with Pāñcālas who were<BR>getting killed while fighting for the sake<BR>of their allies (वध्यतां सूतपुत्रेण<BR>मित्रार्थे ऽमित्रघातिनां) 8. 59. 42, 44-45;<BR>Karṇa scattered away Pāñcāla princes<BR>(? पाञ्चालपुत्रान्); Karṇa was making the<BR>Pāṇḍava army devoid of Pāñcālas (अपाञ्चा-<BR>ल्यं क्रियते); then five senior Pāñcāla<BR>chariot-fighters, Uttamaujas and others,<BR>attacked Karṇa but were not able to fell<BR>down Karṇa from his chariot; all of them<BR>were hit by Karṇa with arrows after he cut<BR>off their bows and banners and killed their<BR>horses and chariots; all of them were<BR>defeated by Karṇa; when they were rescued<BR>by Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki, the five<BR>chariot-fighters got other chariots and, well-<BR>armed, they rallied round Sātyaki to<BR>protect him 8. 60. 1, 10, 15-17, 21-22, 26;<BR>Karṇa tormented Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas<BR>by the lustre of his missiles (प्रताप्य<BR> … अस्त्रतेजसा), but was thoroughly paci-<BR>fied by the lustre of Arjuna (i. e. by<BR>his missiles) (संशान्तः पार्थतेजसा)<BR>8. 68. 43; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas honour-<BR>ed Arjuna when Karṇa was killed 8. 69.<BR>37; (58) In the evening of the seven-<BR>teenth day Duryodhana told Śalya that<BR>when he would be on the battle-field<BR>Pāñcālas would give up all effort (निरुद्य-<BR>माः) 9. 5. 24; Śalya, when chosen by<BR>Duryodhana to lead his army, assured him<BR>that he would kill all Pāñcālas in battle:<BR>“let them see in battle my heroism, strength<BR>of my arms and bow, my skill and power<BR>of my missiles” (विक्रमं मम पश्यन्तु<BR>धनुषश् च महद् बलम् । लाघवं<BR>चास्त्रवीर्यं च भुजयोश् च बलं युधि ॥ )<BR>9. 6. 11, 13-14; after listening to Kṛṣṇa's<BR>advice, Yudhiṣṭhira permitted all Pāñcālas<BR>to leave and he slept that night freed of<BR>all care; all Pāñcālas too, delighted at<BR>Karṇa's death, slept (happily) that night<BR>9. 6. 38-40; (59) On the eighteenth day,<BR>the victorious Pāñcālas went to the battle-<BR>field 9. 7. 42; seeing Śalya's heroism, Duryo-<BR>dhana felt Pāñcālas, Sṛṃjayas and Pāṇḍa-<BR>vas as good as dead 9. 12. 28; having<BR>heard Yudhiṣṭhira's vow to kill Śalya, all<BR>Pāñcālas felt delighted; they blew conches,<BR>beat भेरिस् and पुष्करस् by hundreds and<BR>made loud roar in anticipation of the ful-<BR>filment of the vow (ततः प्रहर्षः … पुनर्<BR>आसीत् … पाञ्चालानां … प्रतिज्ञाम् तां च सं-<BR>ग्रामे धर्मराजस्य पूरयन्) 9. 15. 27-<BR>28; Pāñcālas and others, angered by Śalya's<BR>killing their army, surrounded him 9. 16. 6;<BR>when the Madra army, incited by Duryo-<BR>dhana, entered the Pāṇḍava army, Pāñcālas<BR>and others surrounded Yudhiṣṭhira wishing<BR>his safety (युधिष्ठिरं परीप्सन्तः);<BR>Madra warriors shouted: “where are the<BR>great warriors of Pāñcālas (पाञ्चालानां<BR>महावीर्याः) 9. 17. 8, 13; when the Kau-<BR>rava army fled after the death of Śalya,<BR>Pāñcālas, desirous of victory, persecuted<BR>them; seeing the Kaurava army, oppressed<BR>by fear, running away, Pāñcālas and<BR>Pāṇḍavas spoke to each other about the<BR>victory of Yudhiṣṭhira and the defeat of<BR>Duryodhana 9. 18. 11, 13-14; seeing Śālva's<BR>heroism, Pāñcālas raised cries of despair<BR>(हाहाकारैर् नादयन्तः) and surrounded<BR>his elephant 9. 19. 21; hearing the loud<BR>roar of delighted Kauravas (सिंहनादः<BR>प्रहृष्टानां … ), Pāñcālas were dejected;<BR>when Kṛtavarman and Sātyaki were engaged<BR>in a duel, Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas acted as<BR>spectators (प्रेक्षकाः समपद्यन्त);<BR>when Kaurava army started running away<BR>at the defeat of Kṛtavarman, Duryodhana<BR>attacked Pāñcālas and halted them with<BR>arrows 9. 20. 6-7, 11, 33-34; Pāṇḍavas,<BR>helped by Pāñcālas, stopped the advance of<BR>Kurus and killed their seven hundred<BR>chariot-fighters; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saha-<BR>deva to kill Śakuni; he himself, along with<BR>Pāñcālas, would guard the division of<BR>chariots (रथानीकम् अहं रक्ष्ये) 9. 22.<BR>14, 34; (60) Aśvatthāman left the army of<BR>Pāñcāla king (पाञ्चालराजस्य तद् अनीकम्,<BR>i. e. Pāñcālas) and went to Śakuni 9. 24.<BR>42; (61) Aśvatthāman assured Duryo-<BR>dhana, who had hid himself in water, that<BR>he would that very day kill all Pāñcālas,<BR>or else he would not remove his armour; on<BR>learning the whereabouts of Duryodhana,<BR>when Pāṇḍavas started towards the lake,<BR>the delighted Pāñcālas raised a loud roar<BR>(किलकिलाशब्दः प्रादुरासीद् … ); those<BR>Pāñcālas who survived the war of eighteen<BR>days followed Pāṇḍavas to the lake (पाञ्-<BR>चालानां च ये शिष्टाः) 9. 29. 21, 46, 52:<BR>Duryodhana even in that condition wished<BR>to destroy the enthusiasm of Pāñcālas 9. 30.<BR>43; Duryodhana was not afraid of either<BR>Pāṇḍavas or Pāñcālas; with mace in his<BR>hand he was confident to defeat them in<BR>battle; equipped with mace, he appeared<BR>to Pāñcālas like Indra with his वज्र or<BR>Śiva with his शूल; Pāñcālas and other<BR>Pāṇḍava warriors clapped each other's<BR>palms (अन्योन्यस्य तलान् ददुः); Duryo-<BR>dhana considered that to be his insult;<BR>angered, he said that he would send Pāṇḍa-<BR>vas and Pāñcālas to the abode of Yama<BR>9. 31. 13, 30, 40-44; Pāñcālas welcomed<BR>the decision of Bhīma to fight with Duryo-<BR>dhana and kill him (तद् वचो भीमसेन-<BR>स्य सर्व एवाभ्यपूजयन्) 9. 32. 27; hear-<BR>ing Duryodhana's challenging words, they<BR>also applauded him (संपूजयाम् आसुस्<BR>तद् वचः) 9. 32. 50; seeing the bad omens<BR>which occurred at the time of the down-<BR>fall of Duryodhana, Pāñcālas were dejected<BR>(आविग्नमनसः) 9. 57. 57; they were not<BR>very happy when Balarāma, displeased<BR>with the way Duryodhana was made to<BR>lie low, left for Dvārakā (नातिप्रमनसो<BR>ऽभवन्) 9. 59. 27; when Duryodhana<BR>fell down, Pāñcālas, delighted (प्रहृष्ट-<BR>मनसः), threw up their upper garments<BR>and made roaring sounds; some expressed<BR>their joy by stretching their bows, others<BR>by sounding bow-strings; some blew big<BR>conches and still others beat दुन्दुभिस्;<BR>some made sportive gestures and laughed<BR>(चिक्रीडुश् च तथैवान्ये जहर्षुश् च); they<BR>said many things in praise of Bhīmasena<BR>9. 60. 3-16; hearing that, Kṛṣṇa rebuked<BR>them 9. 60. 17-18; hearing Kṛṣṇa's words<BR>reassuring Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas for the<BR>means they adopted to defeat Kauravas,<BR>Pāñcālas were very much delighted; they<BR>roared like herds of lions (भृशसंहृष्टा<BR>विनेदुः सिंहसंघवत्); Aśvatthāman<BR>assured Duryodhana that he would kill<BR>all Pāñcālas with all sorts of means in the<BR>very presence of Kṛṣṇa (सर्वोपायैर् हि<BR>नेष्यामि प्रेतराजनिवेशनम्) 9. 64. 35;<BR>(a reference to this incident in 1. 2. 180);<BR>(62) References to what happened during<BR>the night of the eighteenth day are found<BR>at the beginning of the Śalyaparvan: (i)<BR>Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that during<BR>that night the three heroes on the side of<BR>Kauravas who survived the war (हतशिष्टास्<BR>त्रयो रथाः) killed the entire Pāñcāla<BR>army; that was told by Saṃjaya to Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra 9. 1. 13, 30; (ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remem-<BR>bered that Duryodhana had assured him<BR>that he would kill all Pāñcālas; he then<BR>asked Saṃjaya to tell him how all Pāñcā-<BR>las, together with foot-soldiers, were killed<BR>(पाञ्चालाश् च यथा सर्वे निहताः सपदा-<BR>नुगाः) 9. 2. 22, 63; (63) In the night<BR>of the eighteenth day Aśvatthāman re-<BR>solved to kill Pāñcālas when they were<BR>asleep; he told Kṛpa that Pāñcālas, tired<BR>due to exertion, would sleep that night<BR>delightfully, trustfully, feeling themselves<BR>victorious, unyoking their horses and keep-<BR>ing away their armours; he would storm<BR>Pāñcālas in their camp to kill them with his<BR>sword and then get peace of mind; he would<BR>repay the debt he owed to his father by<BR>killing Pāñcālas; by killing the Pāñcāla army<BR>at night he will have done his duty and<BR>feel happy 10. 1. 53; 10. 3. 25, 28-32, 34-<BR>35; earlier when Bhīma had stepped on<BR>Duryodhana's head, Pāñcālas growled,<BR>laughed, blew conches and sounded<BR>दुन्दुभिस् 10. 1. 58-59; Kṛpa told Aśva-<BR>tthāman that they should kill Pāñcālas next<BR>day in battle; Aśvatthāman was quite<BR>capable of defeating the Pāñcāla army while<BR>fighting with them; they would return<BR>from the battle-field only after killing the<BR>wretched Pāñcālas or get themselves killed<BR>10. 4. 4, 15, 18; but Aśvatthāman was un-<BR>able to live even for a while since he had<BR>heard Pāñcālas saying: “Droṇa was<BR>killed”; they deserved to be killed by him<BR>10. 4. 25-26; Kṛpa tried to dissuade Aśva-<BR>tthāman by telling him that it would not<BR>be proper to kill Pāñcālas when they were<BR>trustfully asleep 10. 5. 11; but Aśvatthā-<BR>man asked Kṛpa why he did not blame<BR>Pāñcālas who had committed sin by not<BR>following धर्म and broken all norms<BR>of life (एवम् अधार्मिकाः पापाः पाञ्चाला<BR>भिन्नसेतवः); he had therefore decided<BR>to kill them during their sleep 10. 5. 24-<BR>25; Mahādeva told Aśvatthāman that he<BR>formerly protected Pāñcālas only out of<BR>regard for Kṛṣṇa; but now they were over-<BR>powered by Kāla and did not deserve to live<BR>(अभिभूतास् तु कालेन नैषाम् अद्यास्ति<BR>जीवितम्) 10. 7. 63; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked<BR>Saṃjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman<BR>did what was expected of them or<BR>whether they were killed by Pāñcālas<BR>10. 8. 4; when Aśvatthāman came out<BR>of the camp, Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told<BR>him that they had killed Pāñcālas (when<BR>they tried to escape) by thousands; Aśva-<BR>tthāman told them that he had killed the<BR>rest of the Pāñcālas in the camp 10. 8. 141,<BR>150; after killing all Pāñcālas, the three<BR>of them went to Duryodhana; they told<BR>him that all Pāñcālas were killed by them<BR>10. 9. 1, 9, 49; the killing of Pāñcālas<BR>referred to earlier by Dhṛtarāṣṭra as a<BR>disgusting and disgraceful act of Aśva-<BR>tthāman and others 1. 1. 153; 1. 2. 181;<BR>Kṛṣṇa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira by telling<BR>him that Pāñcālas and their companions<BR>(पाञ्चालाश् च सहानुगाः) were killed by<BR>Mahādeva (and not by Aśvatthāman) 10.<BR>18. 26; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was on his way<BR>to the battlefield, Aśvatthāman and others<BR>told him and Gāndhārī that they had<BR>killed Pāñcālas and others 11. 10. 12; (64)<BR>When Yudhiṣṭhira started to meet Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra, Pāñcāla women present there,<BR>followed him (सह पाञ्चालयोषिद्भिर् यास्<BR>तत्रासन् समागताः) 11. 11. 4; (65)<BR>When Pāñcāla and Kuru women saw their<BR>husbands and relatives lying dead on the<BR>battlefield they fell down from their<BR>chariots; tired and helpless they were<BR>almost deprived of their consciousness<BR>(श्रान्तानां चाप्य् अनाथानां नासीत् काचन<BR>चेतना) 11. 16. 13-15; Gāndhārī told Kṛṣṇa<BR>that looking at the destruction of Kurus<BR>and Pāñcālas, she burnt with grief 11. 16.<BR>25; she asked him how was young Abhi-<BR>manyu killed by many in the presence of<BR>Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 11. 20. 18; (66)<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that he was much<BR>more grieved to learn the truth about<BR>Karṇa's birth than by the death of Pāñcālas<BR>and others (ततः शतगुणं दुःखम्)<BR>11. 27. 18-19; (67) Yudhiṣṭhira, repent-<BR>ing after the war, said that Pāñcālas and<BR>Kurus were no doubt killed; but those<BR>of them who were not killed would, after<BR>death, go to the lowest regions on account<BR>of their (i. e. of both Pāñcālas and<BR>Kurus) acts 12. 7. 20; Yudhiṣṭhira while<BR>taking leave of Kuntī said that Pāñcālas<BR>(i. e. their males) were very much depleted,<BR>only their daughters remained (पञ्चालाः<BR>सुभृशं क्षीणाः कन्यामात्रावशेषिताः); he<BR>did not know who would establish their<BR>line again, since most of them were redu-<BR>ced to ashes by Droṇa and those who<BR>survived were killed by Aśvatthāman at<BR>night 15. 44. 32-33.<BR>D. Past event:<BR>Formerly, the ऋषिस् of the Naimiṣa forest<BR>after completing the Viśvajit sacrifice went<BR>to the Pāñcāla country (पुरा … विश्वजितो<BR>ऽन्ते वै पाञ्चालान् ऋषयो ऽगमन्) 9. 40. 3.<BR>E.

Past events: (1) Bhṛgus<BR>acted as priests in the sacrifices of Kṛtavīrya<BR>(also cf. 13. 56. 2); he gave them corn<BR>and wealth at the end of Soma sacrifices<BR>(धान्येन च धनेन च); after the death<BR>of Kṛtavīrya, his kinsmen, when in need<BR>of money, asked eminent Bhṛgus to give it<BR>since they knew Bhṛgus had wealth; some<BR>Bhṛgus, afraid of Kṣatriyas, parted with<BR>their wealth, but others hid it underground;<BR>when one of the kings was digging the<BR>ground he, by chance, found wealth in the<BR>house of a Bhṛgu; the assembled Kṣatriyas,<BR>due to anger, disregarded the supplications<BR>of the Bhṛgus and killed them all with<BR>sharp arrows; they killed even children,<BR>yet unborn (आ गर्भाद् अनुकृन्तन्तश् … )<BR>(also cf. 13. 56. 3); when Bhṛgus were thus<BR>being extirpated their wives took shelter<BR>in mountain Himavant; one of them held<BR>her embryo in her thigh for the conti-<BR>nuation of the line of her husband (तासाम्<BR>अन्यतमा गर्भं भयाद् दाधार तैज-<BR>सम् । ऊरुणैकेन वामोरूर् भर्तुर् कुल-<BR>विवृद्धये ॥ ); when the embryo came out<BR>breaking the thigh he deprived the Kṣatrī-<BR>yas of their eyesight; the Kṣatriyas begged<BR>pardon of the Bhṛgu wife 1. 169. 11-22;<BR>the Bhṛgupatnī told the Kṣatriyas that she<BR>had not deprived them of their eyesight;<BR>that was done by the angry Bhārgava<BR>(Aurva); since the Kṣatriyas started killing<BR>even the unborn Bhṛgus she had held her<BR>embryo in the thigh for a hundred years;<BR>in order to do a favour to the Bhṛgu line-<BR>age, the entire Veda along with the six<BR>Vedāṅgas entered her child even when he<BR>was unborn; the child angered by the death<BR>of his ancestors (Bhṛgus) at the hands of<BR>Kṣatriyas had deprived them of their<BR>eyesight and wished to kill them 1. 170.<BR>1-5; Aurva told the Kṣatriyas born in<BR>the lineage of Kṛtavīrya that while he<BR>was in the thigh of his mother he had<BR>heard the cry of his mothers (आरावं<BR>मातृवर्गस्य भृगूणां) due to the<BR>killings of Kṣatriya; he was angered<BR>because the wretched Kṣatriyas killed<BR>Bhṛgus not sparing even those unborn;<BR>when nobody offered shelter to the wives<BR>of Bhṛgus due to fear, one of them had<BR>concealed him in her thigh (1. 171. 5, 6, 8);<BR>Aurva practised severe penance to take<BR>revenge of the Bhṛgus who were killed<BR>by destroying the worlds; he thought he<BR>would delight the dead Bhṛgus (इच्छन्न्<BR>अपचितिं कर्तुं भृगूणां भृगुसत्तमः<BR>1. 170. 11; Nī., however, on Bom.

hearing<BR>the loud roar of Bhīma and Jarāsandha<BR>the people of Magadha were much afraid,<BR>their pregnant women lost their foetus<BR>(स्त्रीणां गर्भाश् च सुस्रुवुः); they<BR>wondered whether the Himālaya had<BR>broken down or whether the earth was<BR>being torn apart (किं नु स्विद् धिमवान्<BR>भिन्नः किं नु स्विद् दीर्यते मही । इति स्म<BR>मागधा जज्ञुर् … ) 2. 22. 8-9;

(12) On the<BR>fourteenth day, when Vyāghradatta was<BR>killed by Sātyaki, Māgadhas rushed towards<BR>Sātyaki and showered him with arrows and<BR>तोमरस् by thousands and also with<BR>भिण्डिपाल, प्रास and मुद्गर; but Sātyaki<BR>easily defeated them all and they fled 7. 82.<BR>33-36; (13) After the death of Droṇa,<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra, lamenting, recalled Kṛṣṇa's<BR>exploits which included his victory over<BR>Māgadhas 7. 10. 15;

(एवं<BR>हत्वा तव गजान् ॥ ) 8. 17. 28; (16) On<BR>the seventeenth day, Kṛpa, along with the<BR>energetic Māgadha warriors, stood on the<BR>right side of the Bārhaspatyavyūha (8. 31.<BR>26) of the Kauravas (कृपः शारद्वतो<BR>राजन् मागधश् च (for मागधाश् च ?)<BR>तरस्विनः । सात्वतः कृतवर्मा च दक्षि-<BR>णं पक्षम् आश्रिताः ॥ 8. 31. 11 (the cr.<BR>edn. adopts the reading मागधः (sg.);<BR>but it is almost certain that we have to<BR>read मागधाः (pl.); the plural तरस्विनः<BR>is hardly meant to include Kṛpa, Kṛtavar-<BR>man and some Māgadha prince (sg.); he<BR>cannot be Jayatsena since he was already<BR>killed by Abhimanyu; adjective like<BR>तरस्विनः are used with reference to<BR>general warriors;

(18) After the war Gāndhārī<BR>pointed out to Kṛṣṇa Māgadhī women,<BR>who in grief had discarded their gold<BR>ornaments, surrounding the dead body<BR>of Jayatsena and weeping; they rolled on<BR>the ground; their wailing sound deluded<BR>the mind of Gāndhārī ( … प्ररुदिता<BR>मागध्यः पश्य योषितः ॥ प्रकीर्ण-<BR>स्वर्णाभरणा रुदन्त्यः शोककर्शिताः । …<BR>मागध्यः शेरते भुवि ॥ ) 11. 25. 7, 9;<BR>(आसां … मनःश्रुतिहरो नादो मनो<BR>मोहयतीव मे) 11. 25. 8; (19) While<BR>recounting Kṛṣṇa's past exploits, Vasu-<BR>deva remembered that Kṛṣṇa had slain<BR>Māgadha Kings (चक्रे (विदेहान्) कालिङ्ग-<BR>मागधान्) 16. 7. 10.<BR>E. Past events;<BR>(1) The eight sons of Asurī Kālakā<BR>were born as kings; the first of them,<BR>the great Asura, was Jayatsena who was<BR>the illustrious king of the Magadha country<BR>(कालकायास् तु ये पुत्रास् तेषाम् अष्टौ<BR>नराधिपाः । जज्ञिरे … ॥ मगधेषु जयत्-<BR>सेनः श्रीमान् आसीत् स पार्थिवः । अष्टानां<BR>प्रवरस् तेषां कालेयानां महासुरः ॥ )<BR>1. 61. 45-46; (2) Kākṣīva(t) and others<BR>were born of Śūdrā Auśīnarī from the<BR>magnanimous sage Gautama in Maga-<BR>dha; Gautama took his residence in<BR>Magadha; since the kings favoured him,<BR>he took resort with the Magadha dynasty<BR>(शूद्रायां गौतमो यत्र महात्मा सं-<BR>शितव्रतः । औशीनर्याम् अजनयत् काक्षीवा-<BR>दीन् सुतान् ऋषिः ॥ गौतमः क्षयणाद् अस्माद्<BR>अथासौ तत्र वेश्मनि । भजते मागधं<BR>वंशं स नृपाणाम् अनुग्रहात् ॥ ) 2. 19.<BR>5-6; (3) Ambuvīca was formerly the<BR>king at Rājagṛha who ruled over the<BR>Māgadha chieftains (श्रूयते हि पुरा कश्चिद्<BR>अम्बुवीच इति श्रुतः । आसीद् राजगृहे राजा<BR>मागधानां महीक्षिताम् ॥ ) 1. 196. 17.<BR>F.

after receiving their<BR>gifts, Yudhiṣṭhira honoured the great<BR>warriors of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्य्-<BR>अन्धकमहारथान्); the best among the<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्यन्धकोत्त-<BR>माः) lived happily with Kurus and enjoyed<BR>with them great drinking bouts (महा-<BR>पानैर् … विजह्रुः कुरुवृष्णयः);

(8) They were taught the science<BR>of archery by Arjuna (कुमारा … वृष्णि-<BR>नन्दनाः) 2. 4. 29; (9) Vṛṣṇis fled<BR>from Mathurā and settled down at Kuśa-<BR>sthalī in the west; they fortified the new<BR>settlement in such a way as to make it<BR>difficult to be captured even by gods; even<BR>women could fight and hold it against<BR>the attack (स्त्रियो ऽपि यस्यां युध्येयुः<BR>किं पुनर् वृष्णिपुंगवाः 2. 13. 51);<BR>Vṛṣṇis lived there without fear from any<BR>quarter (अकुतोभयाः); although powerful,<BR>they had allied themselves with Pāṇḍavas<BR>because of their relationship (सामर्थ्य-<BR>वन्तः सम्बन्धाद् भवन्तं समुपा-<BR>श्रिताः); Cārudeṣṇa and all other Vṛṣṇi<BR>heroes though free from grief, lived at<BR>Kuśasthalī still remembering the Madhya-<BR>deśa (where they formerly lived) (स्मरन्तो<BR>मध्यमं देशं वृष्णिमध्ये गत-<BR>व्यथाः) 2. 13. 53, 59;

(12) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas<BR>did not pay tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira for<BR>Rājasūya because of their friendly relations<BR>with Pāṇḍavas (सख्येनान्धकवृष्णयः)<BR>2. 48. 42; however, Vārṣṇeyas are said to<BR>have brought for Yudhiṣṭhira many kinds<BR>of tribute (वार्ष्णेयान् हारहूणांश् च<BR> … बल्यर्थं ददतस् तस्मै नानारूपान्<BR>अनेकशः) but were stopped at the gate 2.<BR>47. 19-20, 25; the tribute is described in 2.<BR>47. 21-25 (since Vārṣṇeyas are here listed<BR>along with Cīnas, Hūṇas, Śakas, Oḍras,<BR>forest-dwellers, and Hārahūṇas, are these<BR>Vārṣṇeyas different from Vṛṣṇis who formed<BR>a section of the Yādavas and did not pay<BR>tribute ?): (13) Śiśupāla instigated the<BR>kings assembled for the Rājasūya to fight<BR>with Vṛṣṇis and Pāṇḍavas 2. 36. 14; (14)<BR>Vidura warned Kauravas that Vṛṣṇis would<BR>never forgive the hardship suffered by Drau-<BR>padī in the Sabhā (तस्याः … परिक्लेशं<BR>न क्षंस्यन्ते … । वृष्णयो वा महेष्वासाः)<BR>2. 72. 29; (15) Hearing that Pāṇḍavas<BR>had gone into exile, Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas, and<BR>Andhakas went to meet them in the<BR>Dvaitavana (3. 12. 68); they sat around<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira, blamed Kauravas and won-<BR>dered what they could do (to help them)<BR>3. 13. 1, 3-4; (16) Draupadī complained<BR>to Kṛṣṇa that Kauravas had desired to<BR>reduce her to the status of a दासी although<BR>Vṛṣṇis were alive (दासीभावेन भोक्तुं<BR>माम् ईषुस् ते मधुसूदन । जीवत्सु … अथ<BR>वृष्णिषु) 3. 13. 56; 5. 80. 25; (17) When<BR>Śālva attacked Dvārakā in the absence of<BR>Kṛṣṇa, young Vṛṣṇi heroes fought with him<BR>(बालकैर् वृष्णिपुंगवैः); Śālva killed<BR>many of the excellent Vṛṣṇi heroes (वृष्णि-<BR>प्रवीरांस् तान् बालान् हत्वा) 3. 15. 6-7;<BR>during Śālva's attack on Dvārakā drinking<BR>liquor was prohibited; Vṛṣṇis and Andha-<BR>kas had to remain alert apprehending<BR>Śālva might attack them when they were<BR>drunk (प्रमत्तेष्व् अभिघातं हि कुर्यात्<BR> … इति कृत्वाप्रमत्तास् ते सर्वे वृष्ण्य्-<BR>अन्धकाः स्थिताः ॥ ) 3. 16. 12-13; it was<BR>then ruled that no one in the town of<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could leave or enter<BR>the town without valid permit (न चामुद्रो<BR>ऽभिनिर्याति न चामुद्रः प्रवेश्यते । वृष्ण्य-<BR>न्धकपुरे) 3. 16. 19; when the youthful<BR>Vṛṣṇi princes saw Śālva's army attacking<BR>Dvārakā, they came out and fought with<BR>the opponents (कुमारा वृष्णिनन्दनाः)<BR>3. 17. 8; when Pradyumna swooned, the<BR>army of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas raised a<BR>cry of grief; when Pradyumna regained<BR>consciousness he blamed his charioteer for<BR>removing his chariot away from the battle-<BR>field for that was not the battle-धर्म<BR>of Vṛṣṇ warriors (नैष वृष्णिप्रवीराणाम्<BR>आहवे धर्म उच्यते) 3. 19. 1-2, 5; he<BR>told the charioteer that one who left the<BR>battlefield was not born in the family of<BR>Vṛṣṇis (न स वृष्णिकुले जातो यो वै त्यजति<BR>संगरम्), nor he who killed one fallen<BR>on the ground or who had surrendered,<BR>or a woman, an old man or a child, or<BR>one who was without a chariot, who was<BR>shattered, and whose weapons were broken;<BR>he reminded the charioteer that he (the<BR>charioteer) knew what the धर्म of<BR>Vṛṣṇis was in battles, and since he knew<BR>the entire code of conduct of Vṛṣṇis en-<BR>gaged in fighting he should not have taken<BR>Pradyumna away form battlefield; (धर्-<BR>मज्ञश् चासि वृष्णीनाम् आहवेष्व् अपि … । स<BR>जानंश् चरितं कृत्स्नं वृष्णीणां पृतना-<BR>मुखे । ) 3. 19. 13-16; Pradyumna wonder-<BR>ed what the women of Vṛṣṇi heroes would<BR>say to him when he met them 3. 19. 21;<BR>Pradyumna asked his charioteer how he<BR>could face Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis who<BR>always vied with him (मया स्पर्धन्ति<BR>सततं) 3. 19. 28; the charioteer in reply<BR>told Pradyumna that he was conversant<BR>with the war (conduct) of Vṛṣṇis (and<BR>he defended his action) (युद्धज्ञश् चास्मि<BR>वृष्णीनाम्) 3. 20. 2; Śālva tormented by<BR>Vṛṣṇis rode his Saubha to rise up in<BR>the sky and left Dvārakā 3. 20. 27; when<BR>Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā he was sur-<BR>prised to see the town of Vṛṣṇis with men<BR>and women extremely uneasy (अस्वस्थ-<BR>नरनारीकम् इदं वृष्णिपुरं भृशम्) 3.<BR>21. 4; Kṛṣṇa then spoke to Āhuka, Vasu-<BR>deva and Vṛṣṇi heroes asking them to<BR>remain alert (अप्रमादः सदा कार्यो); he<BR>announced his decision to attack Śālva<BR>which delighted Vṛṣṇis; comforted, they<BR>asked him to kill the enemies and blessed<BR>him 3. 21. 7-11; (18) Dhṛtarāṣṭra feared<BR>that Vṛṣṇi archers and spirited Pāñcālas,<BR>led by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the army of<BR>Kauravas 3. 48. 6; he told Saṃjaya that<BR>it was not possible even for mountains<BR>to withstand the velocity (of the attack)<BR>of Vṛṣṇis when led by Rāma and Kṛṣṇa<BR>(वृष्णीनाम् … । न शक्यः सहितुं वेगः)<BR>3. 48. 7; (19) When Vṛṣṇis went to<BR>Prabhāsa to meet the Pāṇḍavas during<BR>the period of their exile, they found<BR>them smeared with dirt resting on bare<BR>ground; seeing them, Vṛṣṇis were filled<BR>with sorrow and cried loudly; Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>approached Vṛṣṇis and honoured them as<BR>they deserved; they too in return honoured<BR>Pāṇḍavas and sat around them 3. 118. 15,<BR>18-21; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana to<BR>tell him the details of the talks between<BR>Vṛṣṇis, sitting around, and Pāṇḍavas at<BR>Prabhāsa 3. 119. 1-3; Sātyaki suggested to<BR>Balarāma that he should permit the army<BR>of Daśārhas to march against Duryodhana<BR>so that he would perish when overtaken<BR>by the army of Vṛṣṇis; he also said that<BR>the army consisting of principal Kṣatriya<BR>warriors of Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas<BR>should kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and<BR>enhance its fame (क्षत्रियशूरसेना लोके<BR>यशः स्फीतम् उपाकरोतु) 3. 120. 5, 19;<BR>(20) Kṛṣṇa told Draupadī that her<BR>sons while they were in the town of<BR>Vṛṣṇis (Dvārakā) they were not jealous<BR>of gods (तवात्मजा वृष्णिपुरं प्रविश्य<BR>न दैवतेभ्यः स्पृहयन्ति कृष्णे) 3. 180.<BR>25; Satyabhāmā assured Draupadī that<BR>Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis had the same affec-<BR>tion for her sons as for Pradyumna 3. 224.<BR>14; (21) Draupadī warned Jayadratha<BR>that if he insisted on abducting her, Vṛṣṇi<BR>heroes led by Kṛṣṇa, would chase him<BR>(वृष्णिवीरा … पदवीं चरेयुः) 3. 252. 16<BR>(Nī. on 3. 268. 14 (in another context)<BR>पदवीं चरेतां अन्वेषणं कुरुतः);<BR>(22) Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas went<BR>to Upaplavya to attend the marriage of<BR>Abhimanyu 4. 67. 14, 24; Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas<BR>and Bhojas returned to Dvārakā after the<BR>marriage 5. 7. 1; (23) Saṃjaya advised<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira that it was more beneficial for<BR>him to live by begging in the kingdom of<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas than get back the<BR>kingdom by resorting to war (भैक्ष्य-<BR>चर्यां अन्धकवृष्णिराज्ये श्रेयो मन्ये न<BR>तु युद्धेन राज्यम्) 5. 27. 2; (24) An-<BR>dhakas, Vārṣṇeyas and Bhojas followed<BR>the advice of Kṛṣṇa and therefore they<BR>could restrain the enemies and delight their<BR>friends (अन्धकाश् च वार्ष्णेयभोजाः);<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, led by Kṛṣṇa, were<BR>like Indra (कृष्णप्रणीताः सर्व एवेन्द्र-<BR>कल्पाः) 5. 28. 11-12; (25) The son of<BR>Ugrasena (Kaṃsa) once shone amongst<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्यन्धकानां<BR>मध्यगतं तपन्तम्) 5. 47. 72; (26)<BR>Once Nārada advised Vṛṣṇis that they<BR>should do their duty (तस्मात् कर्मैव<BR>कर्तव्यम् इति होवाच नारदः । … वृष्णि-<BR>चक्रस्य) 5. 48. 22 (Nī., however, on<BR>Bom.

Kuntī) (मातृपक्षे<BR>च वृष्णयः । द्वौ पक्षाव् अभिजानीहि); in<BR>that case Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis would<BR>follow him 5. 138. 10, 13, 23; (34) Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira settled down in his camp at Kuru-<BR>kṣetra along with Vṛṣṇis (वृष्निभिश् चैव<BR> … वृतम्) 5. 150. 2; (35) Balarāma came<BR>to Pāṇḍavas along with Vṛṣṇi chiefs (वृष्णि-<BR>मुख्यैर् अभिगतैः) 5. 154. 17; but he<BR>decided not to take part in the war from<BR>any side and left for pilgrimage along with<BR>Vṛṣṇis 9. 34. 1, 5, 12;

(40) Subhadrā<BR>wondered who could have killed Abhi-<BR>manyu when Vṛṣṇi heroes were there to<BR>protect him; she pitied the heroism of<BR>Vṛṣṇi warriors (नाथेषु … वृष्णिवीरेषु;<BR>धिग् वीर्यं वृष्णिवीराणाम्) 7. 55. 9, 12;<BR>(41) On the fourteenth day, Saṃjaya told<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and<BR>others would blame him for the confusion<BR>in his mind (ते बुद्धिव्यभीचारम् उप-<BR>लप्स्यन्ति) 7. 62. 7; the same day, Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira remembered that Arjuna, to praise<BR>Sātyaki, had told him in Dvaitavana that<BR>he would need Sātyaki's help even though<BR>Vṛṣṇis, led by Kṛṣṇa, were ready to help him<BR>7. 85. 54, 58-60; Bhūriśravas wondered how<BR>Arjuna could look upon Vṛṣṇis and Andha-<BR>kas who, by very nature were despicable, as<BR>authority (while deciding what was proper<BR>or improper in war) (प्रकृत्यैव विगर्-<BR>हिताः । वृष्ण्यन्धकाः कथं पार्थ प्र-<BR>माणं भवता कृताः ॥ ) 7. 118. 15; (42)<BR>During the night war (14th-15th day),<BR>Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would<BR>defeat Vṛṣṇis and the rest 7. 133. 11; after<BR>the death of Droṇa, Sātyaki told Dhṛṣṭa-<BR>dyumna that he deserved to be expelled<BR>(from the war) by Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis<BR>since he did a vile act and yet praised<BR>himself (याप्यस् त्वम् असि … सर्वैश् चाप्य्-<BR>अन्धकवृष्णिभिः) 7. 169. 11; (43) Saha-<BR>deva told Sātyaki that just as Pāṇḍavas<BR>had no friends other than Andhakas and<BR>Vṛṣṇis, they too had no friends other than<BR>Pāṇḍavas 7. 169. 48-49; Pāñcālas too<BR>had no friends better than Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 50; (44) On the fifteenth<BR>day, when the Pāṇḍava army was being<BR>burnt by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Yudhiṣṭhira<BR>advised Sātyaki to leave the battle-field<BR>along with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas 7. 170.<BR>26; (45) On the seventeenth day, at<BR>night (निशि 8. 1. 25), Dhṛtarāṣṭra while<BR>lamenting the death of Karṇa, told Saṃjaya<BR>that Karṇa, depending on the strength of<BR>his arms, never thought highly of Vṛṣṇis<BR>(नामन्यत वै नित्यम् … न वृष्णीन् अपि …<BR>स्वबाहुबलम् आश्रितः ॥ ) 8. 5. 15; (46)<BR>After the fall of Duryodhana, when Bala-<BR>rāma, in anger, left for Dvārakā, Pāñcālas<BR>and Vārṣṇeyas were disheartened (पाञ्चालाश्<BR>च सवार्ष्णेयाः … नातिप्रमनसो ऽभवन्)<BR>9. 59. 27; (47) Kṛṣṇa narrated to Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira that Aśvatthāman had once come to<BR>Dvārakā where he was highly honoured by<BR>Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णिभिः परमार्चितः) 10. 12. 11;<BR>Kṛṣṇa told Aśvatthāman that he was never<BR>before requested to part with his चक्र by<BR>any one of the great warriors among Vṛṣṇis<BR>and Andhakas (as Aśvatthāman did) 10.<BR>12. 33; (48) Kṛṣṇa told Gāndhārī that<BR>there was no one else except himself who<BR>could extirpate the clan of Vṛṣṇis (सं-<BR>हर्ता वृष्णिचक्रस्य) 11. 25. 44; (49)<BR>While repenting the loss of life in war,<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira said to Arjuna that if Pāṇḍa-<BR>vas, instead of waging war, had chosen to<BR>beg in the town of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas<BR>they would not have killed the males in the<BR>army of their kinsmen and would not have<BR>met with the misfortune (यद् भैक्षम्<BR>आचरिष्याम वृष्ण्यन्धकपुरे वयम् ।<BR>ज्ञातीन् निष्पुरुषान् कृत्वा नेमां प्राप्स्याम<BR>दुर्गतिन्) 12. 7. 3; (50) Yudhiṣṭhira while<BR>addressing Vyāsa pitied the plight of war<BR>widows who would curse Pāṇḍavas along<BR>with Vṛṣṇis 12. 33. 8; (51) Kṛṣṇa told<BR>Arjuna that a very long time had elapsed<BR>since he was with Baladeva and other Vṛṣṇi<BR>chiefs in Dvārakā (वृष्णिपुंगवान्) and he<BR>would therefore like to return to Dvārakā<BR>14. 15. 20; Arjuna assured him that he<BR>would soon meet them; Yudhiṣṭhira re-<BR>quested Kṛṣṇa to return to Hāstinapura<BR>for the Aśvamedha after meeting Vṛṣṇis 14.<BR>51. 23, 46; (52) When Kṛṣṇa returned<BR>to Dvārakā, Vṛṣṇi heroes were celebrating<BR>the festival of the Raivataka mountain<BR>(विहारो वृष्णिवीराणाम् महे रैवतकस्य<BR>ह) 14. 58. 13; Bhojas, Andhakas and<BR>Vṛṣṇis received Kṛṣṇa on the Raivataka;<BR>Kṛṣṇa honoured them and enquired about<BR>the welfare of Vṛṣṇis who sat around him<BR>(स तान् अभ्यर्च्य मेधावी पृष्ट्वा च<BR>कुशलं तदा) 14. 58. 17-19; (53) On<BR>hearing the war account from Kṛṣṇa, Vṛṣṇis<BR>experienced the feelings of grief, pain,<BR>as well as delight (दुःखहर्षपरिक्लेशा<BR>वृष्णीनाम् अभवंस् तदा) 14. 59. 36; (54)<BR>Kṛṣṇa, along with Vṛṣṇis, went to Hāstina-<BR>pura for the horse sacrifice; when Vṛṣṇi<BR>heroes lived there, Parikṣit was born,<BR>Abhimanyu had told Uttarā that her son<BR>would learn from Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas<BR>the science of archery, the different अस्त्रस्,<BR>and the entire science of morals (गत्वा<BR>वृष्ण्यन्धककुलं धनुर्वेदं ग्रही-<BR>ष्यति । अस्त्राणि च विचित्राणि नीतिशास्त्रं च<BR>केवलम् ॥ ) 14. 65. 1, 8, 24; (55) When<BR>Parikṣit was restored to life by Kṛṣṇa,<BR>Vṛṣṇi chiefs (वृष्णिशार्दूलाः) gave Uttarā<BR>many jewels as gift; when Pāṇḍavas arrived<BR>at the place where Parikṣit was born,<BR>Vṛṣṇi chiefs (वृष्णिपुंगवाः) came out<BR>to welcome them (14. 69. 8-9, 13);<BR>Pāṇḍavas, along with Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णिभिः<BR>सह), entered Hāstinapura; when Vyāsa<BR>arrived, Kuru chiefs (Pāṇḍavas) sat near<BR>him along with Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka<BR>heroes (सह वृष्ण्यन्धकव्याघ्रैः) 14.<BR>70. 2, 11; (56) The Aśvamedha horse<BR>went to Dvāravatī which was protected by<BR>Vṛṣṇi heroes (वृष्णिवीर-) 14. 84. 13; when<BR>the horse sacrifice was in progress, Kṛṣṇa,<BR>with Vṛṣṇis reached Hāstinapura 14. 88. 4;<BR>(57) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that only the<BR>Vṛṣṇi circle (वृष्णिचक्रम्) had survived<BR>the war due to the favour of Kṛṣṇa 15. 44.<BR>34; (58) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana<BR>how were Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Bhojas<BR>destroyed in the presence of Vāsudeva<BR>and who pronounced the curse on them<BR>due to which they perished 16. 2. 1, 3;<BR>Vaiśaṃpāyana then told him that thirtysix<BR>years (after the coronation of Yudhiṣṭhira)<BR>Vṛṣṇis misbehaved and, as dictated by<BR>Kāla, they killed each other with pestle;<BR>the sages (Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and Nārada)<BR>pronounced a curse to the effect that Sāmba<BR>would give birth to an iron pestle for the<BR>destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्य्-<BR>अन्धकविनाशाय); that pestle would wipe<BR>out the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas who were ill-<BR>behaved, cruel and naughty, and the entire<BR>race except Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa (येन<BR>यूयं सुदुर्वृत्ता नृशंसा जातमन्य-<BR>वः । उच्छेत्तारः कुलं कृत्स्नम् ऋते राम-<BR>जनार्दनौ); when Kṛṣṇa heard what had<BR>happened, he told Vṛṣṇis that the curse<BR>would prove true (भवितव्यं तथा) 16.<BR>2. 2, 8-9, 13; the next day Sāmba gave<BR>birth to a pestle for the destruction of<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; when the matter was<BR>reported to Ugrasena he prohibited fer-<BR>mentation of liquor in all the houses of<BR>Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (अद्यप्रभृति सर्-<BR>वेषु वृष्ण्यन्धकगृहेष्व् इह । सुरासवो न<BR>कर्तव्यः सर्वैर् नगरवासिभिः ॥ ) 16. 2.<BR>15, 18; (59) When Vṛṣṇis and Andha-<BR>kas were trying to protect themselves,<BR>Kāla constantly visited their houses; a<BR>certain bald, fierce man surveyed their<BR>houses and disappeared; day after day<BR>strong winds blew to foretell the de-<BR>struction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; day and<BR>night, सारिकास् produced shrill, unceasing<BR>sounds in the houses of Vṛṣṇis; pale pigeons<BR>with red feet, inspired by Kāla, moved in<BR>the houses of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; there<BR>occurred many other bad omens; asses with<BR>shrill voices responded to the sound pro-<BR>duced by Pāñcajanya (एवं प्रयतमाना-<BR>नां वृष्णीनाम् अन्धकैः सह । कालो गृहाणि<BR>सर्वेषां परिचक्राम नित्यशः; पाण्डुरा<BR>रक्तपादाश् च विहगाः कालचोदिताः । वृष्ण्य्-<BR>अन्धकानां गेहेषु कपोता व्यचरंस् तदा;<BR>नदन्तं पाञ्चजन्यं च वृष्ण्यन्धक-<BR>निवेशने । समन्तात् प्रत्यवाश्यन्त रासभा<BR>दारुणस्वराः ॥ ) 16. 3. 1-7, 10-15; Vṛṣṇis,<BR>except Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, were not ashamed<BR>to commit sins; the rest hated Brāhmaṇas,<BR>fore-fathers and gods, disrespected elders<BR>in general; women and men transgressed<BR>rules of morality (पत्न्यः पतीन् व्युच्च-<BR>रन्त पत्नीश् च पतयस् तथा) 16. 3.<BR>8-9; (60) Vṛṣṇi women dreamt at night<BR>that a black woman with white teeth,<BR>laughing, ran around Dvārakā robbing<BR>them and men dreamt that fierce demons<BR>deprived them of their ornaments, छत्रस्<BR>flag-staffs and armours; the चक्र given to<BR>Kṛṣṇa by Agni rose up to the sky within<BR>the sight of Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णीनां पश्यताम्);<BR>the four horses took the chariot upwards<BR>and the Apsarases took away, day and<BR>night, the flag-staffs of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa<BR>and asked Vṛṣṇis to proceed on a तीर्थ-<BR>यात्रा 16. 4. 1-5; (61) The great Vṛṣṇi<BR>and Andhaka heroes desired to go for a<BR>तीर्थयात्रा along with their women; they<BR>took with them eatables (meat) and drinks<BR>(liquors) of different kinds and set out<BR>of the city 16. 4. 6-8; (62) Vṛṣṇi and<BR>Andhaka heroes, overpowered by Kāla,<BR>saw Uddhava deserting them; Kṛṣṇa knew<BR>the iminent destruction of Vṛṣṇis and<BR>hence he did not object to Uddhava's<BR>leaving Vṛṣṇis (कालपरीतास् ते वृष्ण्य्-<BR>अन्धकमहारथाः) 16. 4. 11-12; (63)<BR>Goaded by Kāla, Andhakas, Bhojas, Śaine-<BR>yas and Vṛṣṇis struck one another with<BR>the दर्भस् turned into pestles 16. 4. 36<BR>(cf. 16. 4. 34-35); (64) Brooding over the<BR>destruction of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, Kṛṣṇa<BR>thought it was time for him to depart<BR>(स चिन्तयानो ऽन्धकवृष्णिनाशम् … मेने<BR>ततः संक्रमणस्य कालम्) 16. 5. 18;<BR>(65) Dāruka went to Kurus (i. e.

the Saṃśaptakas<BR>arranged their chariots on even ground<BR>in the व्यूह called Candrārdha; they were<BR>delighted to see Arjuna approaching them<BR>for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was<BR>surprised to find that they were delighted<BR>when actually they should have been<BR>grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were<BR>delighted because they would go to excellent<BR>worlds (after death) which were otherwise<BR>difficult to be obtained by bad people 7.<BR>17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta<BR>conch blown by Arjuna, the army of<BR>Saṃśaptakas became motionless; regaining<BR>consciousness they started fighting with<BR>Arjuna by showering कङ्कपत्रिन् arrows<BR>against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle des-<BR>cribed in which Subāhu, Sudharman and<BR>Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22;<BR>at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers,<BR>afraid, ran towards the army of Duryo-<BR>dhana 7. 17. 23; Suśarman, king of Tri-<BR>gartas, rebuked those who fled; he remind-<BR>ed them of their terrific oaths (शप्त्वा तु<BR>शपथान् घोरान्); the troops of Saṃśap-<BR>takas then blew their conches and returned<BR>to fight till death (मृत्युं कृत्वा निवर्त-<BR>नम् ॥ ) 7. 17. 27-31; seeing that the troops<BR>of Saṃśaptakas were returning Arjuna asked<BR>Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards them;<BR>he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3;<BR>the Vāyavyāstra released by Arjuna to ward<BR>off the arrows of the opponents also blew<BR>away a large number of Saṃśaptakas along<BR>with their chariots, horses, elephants and<BR>weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of<BR>Saṃśaptakas; their condition as well as the<BR>condition of the battle-field described 7. 18.<BR>22-37; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how<BR>Arjuna dealt with the army of Saṃśaptakas<BR>(संशप्तकबलं प्रति) and how did<BR>they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left<BR>Saṃśaptakas for a while to fight with<BR>Bhagadatta who was routing the Pāṇḍava<BR>army; fourteen thousand Saṃśaptakas<BR>followed him and challenged him; Arjuna<BR>hesitated for a while whether to fight with<BR>Saṃśaptakas or go to help Yudhiṣṭhira;<BR>ultimately he decided to kill Saṃśaptakas<BR>(first) (अभवद् भुयसी बुद्धिः संश-<BR>प्तकवधे स्थिरा); the great Saṃśaptaka<BR>chariot-fighters (संशप्तकमहारथाः)<BR>discharged numerous smooth arrows (शत-<BR>सहस्राणि शराणां नतपर्वणां) on<BR>Arjuna with the result that, covered with<BR>the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kṛṣṇa, nor<BR>his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when<BR>Kṛṣṇa was deluded (मोहम् अनुप्राप्तः …<BR>जनार्दनः) Arjuna killed Saṃśaptakas<BR>with Vajrāstra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the<BR>condition of Saṃśaptakas described 7. 26.<BR>21-27; having killed Saṃśaptakas Arjuna<BR>asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards<BR>Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Suśarman and<BR>his Saṃśaptaka brothers followed Arjuna<BR>challenging him for a fight (युद्धार्थी<BR>पृष्थतो ऽन्वयात् ॥ … सुशर्माह्वयते<BR>ऽच्युत ॥ ); Arjuna therefore was again in<BR>doubt-whether to kill Saṃśaptakas first<BR>or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5;<BR>he asked Kṛṣṇa to turn back and started<BR>fighting with Suśarman; his battle with<BR>Saṃśaptaka brothers described in which<BR>Suśarman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later,<BR>Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Saṃ-<BR>śaptakas and Nārāyaṇas on the southern<BR>side of the army (दक्षिणेन तु सेनायाः<BR>कुरुते कदनं बलि । संशप्तकावशेषस्य<BR>नारायणबलस्य च ॥ ) 7. 30. 29; after<BR>killing the Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna returned to<BR>attack Droṇa and the Kaurava army 7. 31.<BR>41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when<BR>Droṇa reiterated the necessity of removing<BR>Arjuna from the main battle, Saṃśapta-<BR>kas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and<BR>took him away to the south of the battle-<BR>field (आह्वयन्न् अर्जुनं संख्ये दक्षिणाम्<BR>अभितो दिशम्) 7. 32. 15; towards the end<BR>of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his<BR>camp after killing Saṃśaptakas 7. 50. 1-3;<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira, grieved over the death of<BR>Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left<BR>to fight with the Saṃśaptaka army, Droṇa<BR>made a serious attempt to capture him 7.<BR>51. 1;

when<BR>Duḥśāsana was wounded by Sātyaki,<BR>Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with<BR>Sātyaki; Saṃśaptakas again made a deter-<BR>mined effort to attack Sātyaki; Sātyaki<BR>killed their five hundred chief warriors,<BR>showering arrows on them, at the head of<BR>the army (अग्रानीके व्यपोथयत्) 7. 99.<BR>3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11;<BR>ultimately they retreated in the direction of<BR>Droṇa 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>was told that on the sixteenth day, angry<BR>Arjuna attacked the Saṃśaptaka troops<BR>(संशप्तकगणान् 8. 9. 8) he wished to<BR>know the details of the fight between Saṃ-<BR>śaptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the<BR>large ocean-like troops of Saṃśaptakas<BR>(संशप्तकगणं … अर्णवसंनिभम्)<BR>and agitated it (व्यक्षोभयत्); the fight<BR>in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads<BR>of his opponents with sharp arrows and<BR>killed elephants and horses along with their<BR>riders as well as chariot-fighters was hair-<BR>raising (लोमहर्षणम्) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at<BR>that point Aśvatthāman challenged Arjuna;<BR>hence he asked Kṛṣṇa whether he should<BR>continue killing Saṃśaptakas or accept the<BR>challenge of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa drove<BR>him to Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 21-22; after<BR>fighting with Aśvatthāman, Arjuna return-<BR>ed to Saṃśaptaka horse-riders, chariot-<BR>fighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers<BR>(ततः संशप्तकान् भूयः साश्वसूतरथ-<BR>द्विपान् । ध्वजपत्तिगणान्) 8. 12. 36;

he cut off the<BR>hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents<BR>who did not turn back (अपराङ्मुखानाम्)<BR>8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more<BR>encounter with Aśvatthāman in which the<BR>latter was removed from the battle by his<BR>horses, Arjuna continued his battle with<BR>Saṃśaptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was<BR>loud noise to the north of the battle-field<BR>(8. 13. 1), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to go<BR>there and first fight with Māgadha Daṇḍa-<BR>dhāra; he could later kill the Saṃśaptakas<BR>8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed<BR>Daṇḍadhāra and his elephant and came<BR>back to Saṃśaptakas 8. 13. 25; in the<BR>battle that followed, Arjuna killed many<BR>Saṃśaptakas, while Kṛṣṇa drove his chariot<BR>in various roundabout ways (वक्रानुव-<BR>क्रगमनात्) 8. 14. 1; the battle described<BR>8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kṛṣṇa advised<BR>Arjuna not to while away his time with<BR>Saṃśaptakas; he should kill them without<BR>loss of time and hasten to kill Karṇa<BR>(किं क्रीडसे ऽनघ । संशप्तकान् प्रम-<BR>थ्यैतांस् ततः कर्णवधे त्वर); Arjuna<BR>agreed and killed quickly the remaining<BR>Saṃśaptakas (क्षिप्रं शिष्टान् संशप्त-<BR>कांस् तदा । आक्षिप्य शस्त्रेण बलाद् …<BR>अवधीत्) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with<BR>Śālvas, Saṃśaptakas, and Nārāyaṇas, led<BR>by the king of Trigartas and his brothers,<BR>attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in<BR>which Saṃśaptakas were killed by hundreds<BR>and thousands (शतशो ऽथ सहस्रशः 8.<BR>19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded<BR>Arjuna and showered him with weapons,<BR>described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost<BR>the entire Saṃśaptaka army turned back<BR>and did not stay to face Arjuna (प्रायशो<BR>विमुखं सर्वं नावतिष्ठत संयुगे);<BR>Arjuna thus won victory over many Saṃ-<BR>śaptaka troops (संशप्तकगणान् बहून्)<BR>8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth<BR>day, thirty-four thousand chariot-fighters of<BR>Śaṃśaptakas determined to fight to the end<BR>stood on the left side of the Bārhaspatya-<BR>vyūha of Kauravas (चतुस्त्रिंशत्सहस्राणि<BR>रथानाम् अनिवर्तिनाम् । संशप्तका …<BR>वामं पार्श्वम् अपालयन् … बार्हस्पत्यः<BR> … महाव्यूहः) 8. 31. 14, 26; Śalya<BR>drew attention of Karṇa to Saṃśaptakas<BR>who had challenged Arjuna; in response,<BR>they were being attacked and killed by<BR>Arjuna; angered Saṃśaptakas covered him<BR>on all sides making Arjuna invisible<BR>(संशप्तकैः क्रुद्धैः … छन्नः पार्थो<BR>न दृश्यते) 8. 31. 56-57; Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>asked Saṃjaya to describe to him the<BR>battle between Arjuna and Saṃśaptakas;<BR>Saṃjaya told him that when the armies<BR>were arrayed (अथ व्यूढेष्व् अनीकेषु),<BR>Arjuna attacked Saṃśaptakas; wishing<BR>to kill Arjuna and determined to win<BR>victory not minding death (विजये कृत-<BR>संकल्पा मृत्युं कृत्वा निवर्तनम्) they<BR>rushed towards Arjuna; their army consi-<BR>sted of many horses, elephants, chariot-<BR>fighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle<BR>then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands,<BR>holding different weapons, as well as their<BR>heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was<BR>drowned in the large army, Saṃśaptakas<BR>delightfully raised a roar (तस्मिन् सैन्ये<BR>महावर्ते … । निमग्नं तं रथं मत्वा<BR>नेदुः संशप्तका मुदा । ) 8. 32. 1-13; at<BR>the site where Arjuna was killing Saṃśapta-<BR>kas a loud sound of Gāṇḍīva was heard;<BR>very much angered Saṃśaptakas, coveting<BR>victory (जयगृद्धाः प्रमन्यवः) sho-<BR>wered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved<BR>their attack and reached Suśarman; when<BR>Arjuna started showering arrows on Suśar-<BR>man, Saṃśaptakas responded the same way;<BR>hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's<BR>chariot, the army of Saṃśaptakas was much<BR>terrified and became motionless; regain-<BR>ing consciousness, the warriors showered<BR>arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot;<BR>they held firmly the horses, the wheels and<BR>the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared<BR>loudly (ते हयान् रथचक्रे च रथेषाश्<BR>चापि भारत । निगृह्य बलवत्); some<BR>mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him<BR>and Kṛṣṇa; shaking his hands Kṛṣṇa felled<BR>them down; Arjuna saw Saṃśaptaka great<BR>chariot-fighters encircling him and holding<BR>his chariot and Kṛṣṇa; he felled many of<BR>them down who had mounted the chariot<BR>and other foot-soldiers who were close to<BR>him by shooting arrows which went short<BR>distances (अपातयत् । आसन्नांश् च ततो<BR>योधाञ् शरैर् आसन्नयोधिभिः); he made<BR>the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to<BR>Kṛṣṇa that he had killed thousands of<BR>Saṃśaptakas who had achieved the difficult<BR>task of checking his chariot (कुर्वाणान्<BR>दारुणं कर्म … रथबन्धं इमं ।<BR>घोरं); Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa blew Deva-<BR>datta and Pāñcajanya conches respy.;<BR>hearing that sound, the Saṃśaptaka army<BR>shook and became very much afraid (सं-<BR>चचाल … वित्रस्ता चाभवद् भृशम्);<BR>Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing<BR>नागास्त्र; he killed them in that condition;<BR>when they were being killed, they gave up<BR>fighting with Arjuna and threw down their<BR>weapons; then Suśarman released them<BR>from their bonds by using सौपर्णास्त्र;<BR>once free, they showered arrows and<BR>weapons on Arjuna (ससृजुर् बाणसं-<BR>घांश् च शस्त्रसंघांश् च); Arjuna cut<BR>off the missiles with arrows and killed many<BR>elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by<BR>using ऐन्द्रास्त्र; the troops of Saṃśaptakas<BR>and Nārāyaṇas were then very much afraid;<BR>no one was able to fight back Arjuna (न<BR>हि कश्चित् पुमांस् तत्र यो ऽर्जुनं प्रत्य-<BR>विध्यत); Arjuna then killed an अयुत of<BR>the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand<BR>(foot) warriors, an अयुत of chariot-<BR>fighters, and three thousand elephant-<BR>riders of Saṃśaptakas who survived (यानि<BR>शिष्टानि) once again surrounded Arjuna<BR>determined either to return with victory<BR>or die (मर्तवयम् इति निश्चित्य जयं वापि<BR>निवर्तनम्); a fierce fighting then was<BR>fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37.<BR>1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Saṃśapta-<BR>kas; their Kṣatriyas, tormented by him,<BR>were killed (ते क्षत्रिया दह्यमानास् …<BR>जग्मुर् विनाशम्) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing<BR>many Saṃśaptaka troops (निहत्य … सं-<BR>शप्तकगणान् बहून्), Arjuna pointed out<BR>to Kṛṣṇa the great Saṃśaptaka chariot-<BR>fighters who along with their troops ran<BR>away as they were unable to resist his<BR>arrows (धावन्ति सगणाः संशप्तकमहा-<BR>रथाः । अपारयन्तो मद्बाणान्) 8. 40. 78-<BR>80; Duryodhana again incited Saṃśaptakas<BR>to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariot-<BR>fighters, three hundred elephant-riders,<BR>fourteen thousand horse-riders and two<BR>hundred thousand archers turned towards<BR>Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna covering them with<BR>arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand<BR>Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna<BR>completely destroyed (कृत्स्नेन व्यध-<BR>मत्) the Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 130; when<BR>the armies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas met<BR>again only a few Saṃśaptakas had sur-<BR>vived (संशप्तकेषु … किंचिच्छिष्टेषु);<BR>Arjuna, after defeating Aśvatthāman (8.<BR>42. 51), asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Saṃ-<BR>śaptakas since fighting with them was his<BR>main task (कार्यम् एतत् परं मम) 8.<BR>42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Saṃ-<BR>śaptaka troops with sharp arrows with the<BR>result that they became the guests of Indra<BR>and became free from grief as they were<BR>happy (शक्रस्यातिथिताम् गत्वा विशोका ह्य्<BR>अभवन् मुदा) 8. 43. 76-77; when Arjuna<BR>told Bhīma that he could not leave the<BR>battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira) without killing Saṃśaptakas who<BR>faced him, Bhīma assured him that he<BR>himself would fight with the Saṃśaptakas<BR>8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira why he had not yet killed<BR>Karṇa told him that during his fight with<BR>Saṃśaptakas, Aśvatthāman had unexpec-<BR>tedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47.<BR>2; later, while boasting about his heroic<BR>deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed<BR>almost all Saṃśaptakas and only a few of<BR>them had survived (संशप्तकानां किंचिद्<BR>एवावशिष्टम्) 8. 49. 96; at one stage, Duḥśā-<BR>sana along with the fully equipped army of<BR>Saṃśaptakas (पृतना समृद्धा) attacked<BR>Bhīma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding<BR>towards Karṇa, Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters<BR>attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna<BR>killed many of them along with their chari-<BR>oteers, and cut off their bows and banners<BR>with sharp arrows; they all fell down from<BR>their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the<BR>seventeenth day, at night, when Saṃjaya<BR>reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa<BR>(8. 1. 25), he (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), while recalling<BR>some of the major events of war, mention-<BR>ed the killing of the Saṃśaptaka army by<BR>Arjuna 8. 1. 41; in reply to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's<BR>question who of the Kurus were still alive<BR>and who dead (के नु जीवन्ति के मृताः)<BR>8. 4. 3, Saṃjaya mentioned Saṃśaptaka<BR>troops (संशप्तकगणाश् च ये) among<BR>those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4.<BR>38; (12) On the eighteenth day, Arjuna<BR>speedily rushed towards Kṛtavarman and<BR>Saṃśaptaka troops which were posted on<BR>the left side of the Sarvatobhadravyūha of<BR>Kauravas 9. 7. 30, 19, 24 (where Saṃ-<BR>śaptakas are designated as Trigartas);<BR>Arjuna, having killed Saṃśaptakas in battle<BR>(हत्वा संशप्तकान् रणे) rushed towards,<BR>the army of Kauravas 9. 9. 59; as the<BR>day advanced (मध्यंदिनगते सूर्ये),<BR>Aśvatthāman, helped by Saṃśaptakas<BR>(संशप्तकवृतो रणे), fought with Arjuna;<BR>the battle was terrific in which a large<BR>number of warriors were killed (तत्र<BR>युद्धं महच् चासीत् … यमराष्ट्रविवर्-<BR>धनम्) 9. 13. 42-43; (विमर्दस् तु महान्<BR>आसीत्) 9. 13. 45; (13) On the nineteenth<BR>day, after the war was over, Saṃjaya,<BR>having returned early in the morning from<BR>the camp (ततः पूर्वाह्णसमये शिबिराद्<BR>एत्य संजयः 9. 1. 14), while reporting<BR>to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the war-events mentioned<BR>Saṃśaptakas among those who were killed<BR>in war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛtarāṣṭra lamenting the<BR>loss of life in war mentioned that many<BR>Saṃśaptakas were killed (संशप्तकाश् च<BR>बहवः (निहताः)) 9. 2. 34; (14) Kṛṣṇa,<BR>while giving an account of war to Vasu-<BR>deva, mentioned that before the fall of<BR>Abhimanyu, Saṃśaptakas had challenged<BR>Arjuna for a battle and took him away<BR>from the main scene (समाहूते तु सं-<BR>ग्रामे पार्थे संशप्तकैस् तदा) 14. 60.<BR>19.<BR>C.

but Sātyaki assured<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira that the warriors of Suvīra<BR>countries were not at all a match for<BR>Arjuna once he was angry (ये च सौवीरका<BR>योधास् … । एते ऽर्जुनस्य क्रुद्धस्य कलां<BR>नार्हन्ति षोडशीम्) 7. 86. 28-29; the army<BR>of Kauravas which included warriors from<BR>Sindhu, Suvīra and Kuru countries was<BR>scattered by the swift arrows of both Karṇa<BR>and Bhīma fighting with each other (ततो<BR>व्युदस्तं तत् सैन्यं सिन्धुसौवीरकौर-<BR>वम् । प्रोत्सारितं … ); afflicted by arrows<BR>and with their horses and men killed and<BR>chariots broken (हताश्वनरवाहनाः) they<BR>left Bhīma and Karṇa and ran in all direc-<BR>tions; thinking that the gods were deluding<BR>them for the benefit of Bhīma (नूनं<BR>पार्थार्थम् एवास्मान् मोहयन्ति दिवौ-<BR>कसः) they stopped shooting arrows and<BR>became spectators (शरपातं समुत्सृज्य<BR>स्थिता युद्धदिदृक्षवः) 7. 113. 7, 11-14;<BR>Karṇa was enraged to see the destruction<BR>all around of the army of Kuru, Sindhu<BR>and Suvīra countries (कुरुसौवीरसैन्ध-<BR>वानां बलक्षयम् … सर्वतः), the dead<BR>bodies of elephants, and the earth covered<BR>with the armours, banners and weapons 7.<BR>114. 17-18; (13) On the fifteenth day,<BR>when Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard the death of Droṇa<BR>he remembered that Sātyaki had formerly<BR>defeated the large army of a king (not<BR>named) of the Suvīra country (सौवीर-<BR>राजस्य प्रमथ्य महतीं चमूं) 7.<BR>9. 29; (14) When the war was over,<BR>Gāndhārī, on the battle-field, pointed out<BR>to Kṛṣṇa women of the Sindhu and Suvīra<BR>countries who sat around the dead body<BR>of Jayadratha keeping watch over him<BR>(तम् एताः पर्युपासन्ते रक्षमाणा महा-<BR>भुजम् । सिन्धुसौवीर° °स्त्रियः॑) 11.<BR>22. 9. 11.<BR>E.

Epic events: (1) Bhīma told<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to<BR>get back the kingdom by waging war<BR>with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count<BR>on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and<BR>Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified<BR>with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him<BR>that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas<BR>wish well of him and keep quiet (only he<BR>and Draupadī got excited) (सर्वे ते प्रियम्<BR>इच्छन्ति बान्धवाः सह सृञ्जयैः । अहम्<BR>एको ऽभिसंतप्तो माता च प्रतिविन्ध्यतः ॥ )<BR>3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it<BR>was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their<BR>share of kingdom before war broke out<BR>in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by<BR>Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5.<BR>56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upa-<BR>plavya, he asked him (Saṃjaya) to enquire<BR>about the health of all including Sṛñjayas<BR>(तेषां भागं … पुरा युद्धात् साधु तस्य<BR>प्रदानम् ॥ … अनामयं मद्वचनेन पृ-<BR>च्छेः) 5. 22. 8-9, 38; (3) Sañjaya wanted<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that<BR>Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and the rest<BR>of the assembled kings would live in happi-<BR>ness (शमं कुर्या येन शर्माप्नुयुस् ते)<BR>5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya to<BR>communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were<BR>also present 5. 25. 1; Saṃjaya appealed to<BR>all of them to act in a way that would<BR>lead to the well-being of Kurus and Sṛñja-<BR>yas (कृताञ्जलिः शरणं वः प्रपद्ये<BR>कथं स्वस्ति स्यात् कुरुसृञ्जयानाम्) 5.<BR>25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there<BR>could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas<BR>when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had usurped the pro-<BR>sperity of Pāṇḍavas (कथं स्वस्ति स्यात्<BR>कुरुसृञ्जयानाम् । आत्तैश्वर्यो धृतराष्ट्रः<BR>परेभ्यः । ) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also<BR>told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the<BR>advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were cap-<BR>able of controlling their enemies and de-<BR>lighting their friends (सृञ्जयाश् … । उपासीना<BR>वासुदेवस्य बुद्धिं … ) 5. 28. 11; (4)<BR>Saṃjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas<BR>and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that<BR>Arjuna wanted him to convey to the<BR>Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana<BR>would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭa-<BR>dyumna fighting at the head of the army<BR>of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṃjaya that<BR>their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in<BR>astrology had predicted the destruction of<BR>Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37,<BR>93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who<BR>could see and listen to the words of Kṛṣṇa<BR>which were meant for the welfare of<BR>Sṛñjayas (भारतीम् … शङ्करीं सृञ्जया-<BR>नाम्) 5. 69. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 71. 2:<BR>शंकरीं कल्याणकरीम्); (6) Kṛṣṇa<BR>assured Yudhiṣṭhira that when he met the<BR>Kauravas he would try to keep the agitated<BR>Kurus and Sṛñjayas away from the noose<BR>of death (मोचयेयं मृत्युपाशात् संरब्-<BR>धान् कुरुसृञ्जयान्) 5. 70. 81; (7) Before<BR>Kṛṣṇa left to meet the Kauravas, Drau-<BR>padī told him that the Pāṇḍavas, along<BR>with Sṛñjayas would be able to face the<BR>army of Kauravas (शक्ष्यन्ति हि महाबाहो<BR>पाण्डवाः सृञ्जयैः सह । धार्तराष्ट्र-<BR>बलं … प्रतिसमासितुम्) 5. 80. 11 (Nī.<BR>on Bom.

(9) Duryodhana<BR>wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong<BR>did the Kauravas do to Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Sṛñjayas or for what fault of Kauravas<BR>did they want to kill Kauravas (किम् अस्मा-<BR>भिः कृतं तेषां कस्मिन् वा पुनर् आगसि) 5.<BR>125. 11; (10) When Ulūka was asked by<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira to convey to the assembly the<BR>view of Duryodhana, he spoke to them<BR>who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas<BR>5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryo-<BR>dhana that in case of war Droṇa would<BR>kill Sṛñjayas (गच्छेद् अन्तं सृञ्जयानाम्)<BR>5. 164. 15;

(14) On the<BR>fourth day, at one stage, Kurus and Sṛñja-<BR>yas watched the duel between Bhīṣma and<BR>Arjuna 6. 56. 28; (15) On the fifth day,<BR>towards midday (मध्यन्दिनगते सूर्ये 6.<BR>68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle<BR>with Kurus in which arrows, शक्तिस्, तोमरस्<BR>were used 6. 68. 15-16; the battle describ-<BR>ed 18-19; the same day, later, Sṛñjayas,<BR>when they lost their armours, and their<BR>chariots were broken and bows were cut<BR>off, and their hair dishevelled, they wrestled<BR>with Kurus (बाहुभिः समयुध्यन्त) 6.<BR>69. 39; when the sun was about to set<BR>(सूर्ये ऽस्तम् उपगच्छति 6. 70. 34), and<BR>when the stopping of the war was declared,<BR>Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas, went to<BR>their camps 6. 70. 37; (16) On the sixth<BR>day, when Bhīṣma and Droṇa started killing<BR>the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas<BR>fied (पलायनपराभवन्) 6. 71. 32;

later in the afternoon (अपरां<BR>दिशम् आस्थाय स्थिते सवितरि 6. 82. 28)<BR>Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikha-<BR>ṇḍin and attacked Sṛñjayas; they were<BR>happy to face Bhīṣma (सृञ्जयास् तु ततो<BR>हृष्टा … ) and raised loud roars and blew<BR>their conches; a fierce battle followed in<BR>which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders<BR>mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28;<BR>(18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started<BR>killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they<BR>attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñja-<BR>yas not directly mentioned, only Pāñcālas<BR>are mentioned); Bhīṣma cut off arms and<BR>heads of those riding horses and elephants<BR>and deprived the chariot-fighters of their<BR>chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84.<BR>3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and<BR>Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their<BR>army; the Kṣatriyas rolled on the ground<BR>like those afflicted by ailments; their cry<BR>was like one of those who become lean<BR>due to hunger (विवेष्टन्तः स्म दृश्यन्ते<BR>व्याधिक्लिष्टा नरा इव ॥ … अनिशं श्रूयते<BR>शब्दः क्षुत्कृशानां नृणाम् इव ॥ ) 6. 85.<BR>20-23; after the death of Irāvant, there<BR>was fierce fighting in which the Kaurava<BR>army and Sṛñjayas, not caring for their<BR>lives in battle, killed one another; with<BR>their hair loose and without their armours,<BR>when they were deprived of their chariots<BR>and their bows were cut off they wrestl-<BR>ed with one another (जुह्वतः समरे<BR>प्राणान् निजघ्नुर् इतरेतरम् ॥ मुक्तकेशा<BR>विकवचा विरथाश् छिन्नकार्मुकाः । बाहु-<BR>भिः समयुध्यन्त समवेताः परस्प-<BR>रम् ॥ ) 6. 86. 76-77; when Bhagadatta<BR>proceeded to attack Yudhiṣṭhira, he fought<BR>a severe battle with Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and<BR>Kekayas who were ready to fight with their<BR>weapons (उद्यतायुधैः) 6. 91. 79-80;<BR>Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that since he had<BR>dug up enmity with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas<BR>he should fight with them manfully;

so at the start of<BR>the night (रात्रिमुखे) Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis<BR>and Sṛñjayas held consultation (मन्त्राय<BR>समुपाविशन्) 6. 103. 8, 10-11; (20) At<BR>the start of the tenth day, Kaurava army<BR>was being destroyed by the sharp arrows<BR>of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; hence, Bhīṣma,<BR>not caring for life, attacked them 6. 104.<BR>23, 26, 29; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya<BR>how on the tenth day Bhīṣma, when attack-<BR>ed by Śikhaṇḍin determined to kill him<BR>(6. 104. 45-46), fought with Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Sṛñjayas (दशमे ऽहनि) 6. 105. 3; when<BR>Bhīṣma began to destroy the Pāṇḍava army,<BR>the great chariot-fighters (महारथाः)<BR>of Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma to kill him<BR>(वधायाभ्यद्रवन् भीष्मम्) 6. 105. 35;<BR>as the war advanced Pāṇḍavas, backed<BR>by Sṛñjayas (संहताः सह सृञ्जयैः),<BR>attacked Bhīṣma 6. 110. 40; Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>once again asked Saṃjaya how Bhīṣma<BR>fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas on<BR>the tenth day 6. 111. 1; as advised<BR>by Bhīṣma, Arjuna led Sṛñjayas (and<BR>Pāñcālas) to attack Bhīṣma and kill him;<BR>Sṛñjayas were asked to attack Bhīṣma<BR>without fear as they would be protected by<BR>Bhīma and Arjuna 6. 111. 15-20; exhorted<BR>by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas<BR>attacked Bhīṣma showering weapons on<BR>him (शस्त्रवृष्ट्या); angered Bhīṣma fought<BR>with them 6. 113. 16-18; the weapons used<BR>by Sṛñjayas are detailed in 6. 114. 2-3;<BR>Sṛñjayas and Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar<BR>when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 101; at the<BR>end of the tenth day when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was<BR>informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he<BR>wondered who could be the warriors who<BR>surrounded Bhīṣma (के वीराः पर्यवारयन्)<BR>while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas<BR>and Sṛñjayas; he also wished to know who<BR>from among the Kauravas were on the<BR>left side of the wheel of Bhīṣma and shot<BR>arrows on Sṛñjayas (वामे चक्रे वर्तमानाः<BR>के ऽघ्नन् संजय सृञ्जयान्) 6. 15. 25,<BR>28, 32; (21) On hearing the death of<BR>Bhīṣma (7. 2. 1), Karṇa admitted that the<BR>army which included Pāṇḍavas, Sātyaki,<BR>Kṛṣṇa and Sṛñjayas was invincible by kings;<BR>7. 2. 31; (22) On the eleventh day,<BR>Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas met with arrows<BR>Droṇa's attack on them; Droṇa broke and<BR>scattered their army; agitated by the arrows<BR>of Droṇa, they were again and again sca-<BR>ttered by him (ते कम्प्यमाना द्रोणेन<BR>बाणैः पाण्डवसृञ्जयाः । पुनः पुनर् अभ-<BR>ज्यन्त) 7. 6. 33, 35, 41; Sṛñjayas, though<BR>they tried, were not able to kill the army<BR>of Droṇa as it was protected by him; since<BR>Droṇa was acting very swiftly, Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Sṛñjayas felt as if there were many Droṇas<BR>(एकम् आशुकारिणम् आहवे । अनेकम् इव<BR>संत्रासान् मेनिरे) 7. 12. 19, 23; Sṛñjayas<BR>trembled seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning<BR>the army of Pāṇḍavas (साक्षाद् अग्निम् इवो-<BR>त्थितम्) 7. 13. 2; Sṛñjayas and others with<BR>their weapons raised (उद्यतायुधाः) met<BR>the attack of Aśvasena and others; a fierce<BR>battle ensued 7. 15. 11-12; at the sunset<BR>when the withdrawal of the Pāṇḍava army<BR>was declared by Arjuna (स्वान्य् अनीकानि …<BR>अवहारयत्), Sṛñjayas greeted him for his<BR>deeds during the day 7. 15. 49-50; (23) On<BR>the twelfth day, after killing Śatānīka, Droṇa<BR>repeatedly defeated Sṛñjayas and others;<BR>seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of<BR>Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas trembled; due to the<BR>heroism of Droṇa, a river carrying the<BR>bodies of Kurus and Pāñcālas to the god<BR>of death began to flow (नदीम् अन्तक-<BR>गामिनीम्) 7. 20. 23-24, 34, 36; when Droṇa<BR>killed a Pāñcāla prince, Sṛñjayas and others<BR>attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill<BR>Droṇa’ (हत द्रोणं हत द्रोणम् इत्य्<BR>आसीत् तुमुलं महत् । ); but Droṇa agitated<BR>them who were very angry 7. 20. 48-49;<BR>when Sṛñjayas and others were agitated and<BR>were pushed back (चलितान् … प्रणुन्नान्)<BR>by the arrows of Droṇa, Kauravas raised a<BR>loud roar 7. 21. 7-8; Duryodhana drew<BR>attention of Karṇa towards Bhīma who was<BR>deserted by Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas<BR>(हीनः पाण्डवसृञ्जयैः) 7. 21. 16; (24)<BR>On the thirteenth day, Pāñcāla army which<BR>included thousands of Sṛñjayas attacked<BR>Droṇa; but Droṇa arrested their advance<BR>with arrows; then Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas did<BR>not attack him 7. 34. 5-7, 10; when Abhi-<BR>manyu defeated Duḥśāsana, Sṛñjayas and<BR>others were delighted 7. 39. 11, 17-18;<BR>when Subhadrā heard the death of Abhi-<BR>manyu, she pitied Sṛñjayas and the rest<BR>who did not seem to know when Abhi-<BR>manyu was felled down (धिक् केकयांस् …<BR>सृञ्जयान् । ये त्वा रणे गतं वीरं न<BR>जानन्ति निपातितम्) 7. 55. 13; (25) On the<BR>fourteenth day, Sātyaki shot arrows at<BR>Droṇa who was as though swallowing<BR>(ग्रसन्तम् इव) Sṛñjayas 7. 72. 34; the<BR>demon Alambusa made a river flow on the<BR>battle-field carrying the dead bodies of<BR>Sṛñjayas and others (नदीं प्रवर्तयाम्<BR>आस) 7. 83. 30; when the Pāṇḍava army,<BR>which included Sṛñjayas, attacked Droṇa<BR>there was a loud roar among the Sṛñjayas<BR>(तत्रारावो महान् आसीत्); when Droṇa<BR>started killing them, Sṛñjayas found no<BR>protector 7. 85. 20, 26; Yudhiṣṭhira assured<BR>Sātyaki that when he (Sātyaki) would leave<BR>to assist Arjuna, Sṛñjayas and others would<BR>be there to protect him (Yudhiṣṭhira) 7.<BR>86. 45; Sṛñjayas and others, thrilled, rushed<BR>at Droṇa to fight with him with all their<BR>might (सर्वशक्त्या); but Droṇa killed<BR>them 7. 101. 50-52; Droṇa asked Duryo-<BR>dhana to go to help Jayadratha; he himself<BR>would obstruct the onward march of<BR>Sṛñjayas and others 7. 105. 21; (26) After<BR>the death of Jayadratha, before the start<BR>of the night war between the fourteenth<BR>and fifteenth day, Droṇa pointed out to<BR>Duryodhana the armies of Pāṇḍavas and<BR>Sṛñjayas marching towards him (Droṇa)<BR>7. 126. 31; he directed Duryodhana to hold<BR>back his army if he could, for Kurus and<BR>Sṛñjayas would continue to fight even dur-<BR>ing the night; with these words, Droṇa mar-<BR>ched against Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas (त्वं<BR>च दुर्योधन बलं यदि शक्नोषि धारय)<BR>7. 126. 38-39; then, there was fierce fighting<BR>in the evening (संध्यायाम्) all around<BR>between Droṇa and Sṛñjayas 7. 129. 18;<BR>when the fierce fighting progressed during<BR>the night, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas together<BR>attacked Droṇa (रात्रियुद्धे तथा घोरे<BR>वर्तमाने सुदारुणे); Droṇa forced all<BR>of them back killing some of them (तान्<BR>सर्वान् विमुखांश् चक्रे कांश्चिन् निन्ये<BR>यमक्षयम्) 7. 129. 34-35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>asked Saṃjaya how did Kauravas feel<BR>when Droṇa entered the (army of) Sṛñjayas<BR>(का वो ऽभूद् वै मतिस् तदा) 7. 130. 1;<BR>Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas followed Bhīma and<BR>Arjuna who showered arrows on Droṇa<BR>trying to scatter the army of Drupada with<BR>Vāyavyāstra 7. 132. 37, 41; 7. 136. 14;<BR>Aśvatthāman challenged his opponents to<BR>attack him and then killed Pāñcālas and<BR>Sṛñjayas; they abandoned Aśvatthāman and<BR>fled in all directions (व्यद्रवन्त दिशो दश<BR>7. 135. 19) when their chariots and banners<BR>were scattered (विप्रकीर्णरथध्वजाः) 7.<BR>135. 51; Duryodhana asked Duḥśāsana and<BR>his other brothers to offer protection to<BR>Droṇa who would then kill Sṛñjayas and<BR>their kings (सृञ्जयांश् च सराजकान्); when<BR>all Sṛñjayas were killed, Aśvatthāman would<BR>kill Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 139. 24-25; in the<BR>fighting that followed Aśvatthāman cover-<BR>ed Drupada and Droṇa covered Sṛñjayas<BR>with smooth arrows (छादयाम् आसतुः<BR>संख्ये शरैः संनतपर्वभिः) 7. 139.<BR>31; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fight-<BR>ing with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas<BR>raised a loud roar (सिंहनादं प्रच-<BR>क्रिरे) 7. 141. 32; considering that Bhīma<BR>had killed Duryodhana, Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas<BR>and others made all effort to attack Droṇa<BR>to fight with him (सर्वोद्योगेनाभिजग्मुर्<BR> … ); a fierce battle then was fought 7.<BR>141. 60; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were<BR>being killed by Karṇa, they apprehended<BR>his presence nearby even when a blade of<BR>grass stirred (तृणप्रस्पन्दनाच् चापि सूत-<BR>पुत्रं स्म मेनिरे) 7. 148. 15 (Nī. on<BR>Bom. Ed. 7. 173. 19: अतिभयात् तृणचलन-<BR>मात्रेणापि कर्णं प्राप्तं मेनिरे); they<BR>mistook a running warrior on their own<BR>side to be Karṇa (अपि स्वं समरे योधं<BR>धावमानं विचेतसः । कर्णम् एवाभ्य-<BR>मन्यन्त … ); hence, afraid, they ran<BR>but Karṇa attacked them from behind<BR>(पृष्ठतो विकिरञ् शरान्) 7. 148. 15-17;<BR>when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were excessi-<BR>vely tormented by the Rākṣasas of Alā-<BR>yudha they had no peace of mind (न<BR>शान्तिं लेभिरे तत्र) 7. 152. 31; Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra wondered why Karṇa, instead of<BR>killing Ghaṭotkaca, did not kill Arjuna<BR>with the शक्ति given to him by Indra; for,<BR>the death of Arjuna would have meant the<BR>death of all Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas long<BR>ago 7. 157. 2; the same opinion was held<BR>by Kṛṣṇa (and hence he deluded the mind<BR>of Karṇa whenever he faced Arjuna) 7.<BR>157. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how<BR>did Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas with their armies<BR>arrayed and in striking position (व्यूढानी-<BR>काः प्रहारिणः) fight with Kurus and how<BR>did they attack Droṇa who, not caring for<BR>his life, had plunged into their army after<BR>the death of Ghaṭotkaca (जीवितं त्यक्त्वा<BR>गाहमानं वरूथिनीम्) 7. 158. 13-15;<BR>Droṇa killed three grand-sons of Drupada<BR>and then defeated Cedis, Kekayas, Sṛñjayas<BR>and Matsyas 7. 161. 31-32; (27) On<BR>the fifteenth day, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas,<BR>although they were being killed by Droṇa,<BR>attacked him and confused him (मोहयन्तो<BR>महारथम्) 7. 164. 60; after killing Vasu-<BR>dāna (king of Pāṃśurāṣṭra), Droṇa killed<BR>six thousand Sṛñjayas 7. 164. 85; exhorted<BR>by Yudhiṣṭhira to assist Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the<BR>great chariot-fighters of Sṛñjayas attacked<BR>Droṇa in order to kill him; Droṇa with<BR>great speed moved against them not mind-<BR>ing his death (मर्तव्यम् इति निश्चितः);<BR>bad omens occurred; Droṇa, encircled by<BR>the armies of Drupada, moved burning<BR>host of Kṣatriyas and killed a very large<BR>number of them 7. 165. 8-16; when ulti-<BR>mately Droṇa was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna,<BR>Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas attacked the dis-<BR>heartened Kurus with the result that their<BR>army was shattered (निरुत्साहान् कुरून्<BR> … अभ्यद्रवन् … ततः सैन्यं व्यदीर्-<BR>यत) 7. 165. 58; when Aśvatthāman<BR>used his नारायणास्त्र, Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas<BR>and Sṛñjayas were dismayed to see the<BR>mid-region filled with different weapons<BR>(शस्त्राकृतिभिर् आकीर्णम् अतीव … दृष्ट्वा-<BR>न्तरिक्षम् आविग्नाः पाण्डुपाञ्चालसृञ्जयाः)<BR>7. 170. 20; at the end of the day, when<BR>Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the<BR>death of Droṇa, he asked Saṃjaya what<BR>was Droṇa doing on the battle-field<BR>when Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas managed<BR>to kill him (किं कुर्वाणं रणे द्रोणम्<BR>जघ्नुः पाण्डवसृञ्जयाः) 7. 8. 1; Saṃjaya<BR>assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that since he was an<BR>eye-witness to the whole event (सर्वं<BR>प्रत्यक्षदर्शिवान्) he would narrate to him<BR>how Droṇa fell when overpowered (सादितः)<BR>by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 7. 11. 1; (28)<BR>On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana was<BR>confident that with Karṇa as their general<BR>Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas would<BR>loose their consciousness (गतचेतसः) 8.<BR>6. 31; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that<BR>Karṇa, as intended by Aśvatthāman (अश्व-<BR>त्थामनश् च संकल्पाद् … ) had killed<BR>Sṛñjayas 8. 16. 5; Karṇa brought Sṛñjayas<BR>and Pāñcālas within the range of his arrows<BR>and crushed them (शरगोचरम् आनयत् ।<BR>ममर्द); Kurus, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas<BR>fought with great effort not caring for<BR>their life (व्यायच्छमानाः सुभृशम् …<BR>प्रियान् असून् रणे त्यक्त्वा) 8. 16. 22, 24-<BR>25; battle described 8. 16. 26-38; at mid-<BR>day (मध्यं गते दिनकरे 8. 17. 100),<BR>although Karṇa killed Sṛñjayas they attack-<BR>ed him 8. 17. 117; (29) On the seven-<BR>teenth day, early morning (प्रभातायां<BR>रजन्यां तु 8. 22. 29) before the start of<BR>the war, Duryodhana while requesting Śalya<BR>to act as a charioteer of Karṇa told him<BR>that with a good charioteer like him, Karṇa<BR>would be able to destroy Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcā-<BR>las and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; at the start of<BR>the war on that day, Pāñcālas, Cedis and<BR>Sṛñjayas fought a fierce battle with the<BR>Kaurava army 8. 32. 15; Dhṛtarāṣṭra<BR>remembered that Karṇa had boasted earlier<BR>that he alone would kill Sṛñjayas along<BR>with Pāṇḍavas 8. 35. 2; Sṛñjayas cut off<BR>(शातयाम् आसुः) the arrows shot at them<BR>by Kṛpa 8. 38. 4; Karṇa stopped the on-<BR>ward march of Sṛñjayas and others who<BR>were led by Bhīma 8. 38. 16; Karṇa killed<BR>Cedis, Karūṣas and Sṛñjayas in the presence<BR>of Bhīma; when Bhīma left Karṇa to fight<BR>with the Kuru army, Karṇa killed thou-<BR>sands of great archers of Sṛñjayas (सृञ्-<BR>जयांश् च महेश्वासान् निजघान सहस्र-<BR>शः) 8. 40. 2-4; Sṛñjayas were ‘burnt’ by<BR>the fire in the form of Karṇa (कर्णाग्निना<BR> … दग्धा … ) 8. 40. 61; Arjuna pointed out<BR>to Kṛṣṇa that the large army of Sṛñjayas<BR>was being scattered (दीर्यते) by Karṇa<BR>8. 40. 81; when Bhīma returned to fight<BR>(संनिवृत्तो रणं प्रति), Pāñcālas and<BR>Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed<BR>him 8. 41. 3; Kurus led by Karṇa and<BR>Sṛñjayas led by Yudhiṣṭhira faced one<BR>another without fear (अभीताः) 8. 42. 1;<BR>Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa,<BR>after defeating Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and<BR>Sṛñjayas was looking for Arjuna: when<BR>the Kuru warriors saw Karṇa displaying<BR>his valour by harassing Pāṇḍavas and<BR>thousands of Sṛñjayas they raised a loud<BR>roar (नदन्ति); Karṇa encouraged Kau-<BR>rava warriors to attack Sṛñjayas so that<BR>none of them escaped alive (यथा जिवन्<BR>न वः कश्चिन् मुच्यते) 8. 43. 36; Kṛṣṇa<BR>was glad to point out to Arjuna that Bhīma,<BR>along with Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas, had once<BR>again returned to the battle-field 8. 43. 52;<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira wondered whether the en-<BR>counter of Sṛñjayas and Kauravas in which<BR>he was humiliated had become known to<BR>the fighters (कच्चित् संग्रामे विदितो वा<BR>तदायं समागमः सृञ्जयकौरवा-<BR>णाम् । यत्रावस्थाम् ईदृशीं प्रापितो ऽहम्)<BR>8. 46. 41; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that all<BR>Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with their followers<BR>were prepared to fight when they had<BR>resorted to him (एते च सर्वे पाञ्चालाः<BR>सृञ्जयाश् च सहान्वयाः । त्वां समासाद्य<BR> … व्यवस्थिताः) 8. 51. 5; while taking<BR>stock of some of the events of the battle<BR>which had lasted for seventeen days (अद्य<BR>सप्तदशाहानि 8. 51. 2), Kṛṣṇa reminded<BR>Arjuna that while Bhīṣma was fighting,<BR>Sṛñjayas were unable to look at him;<BR>Bhīṣma routed Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas<BR>and distinguished himself as the sole<BR>war hero (एकवीरत्वम् आगतः) 8. 51. 35;<BR>Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Bhīma,<BR>covered on all sides by Sṛñjayas, was<BR>being tormented while fighting with Karṇa:<BR>if Karṇa was neglected he might kill<BR>Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas 8. 51.<BR>105-106; at one stage in the battle, Utta-<BR>maujas had engaged Sṛñjayas 8. 53. 6;<BR>Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot<BR>towards Karṇa, lest he destroyed all Sṛñ-<BR>jaya great chariot-fighters in battle in their<BR>presence (राधेयो ऽप्य् अन्यथा पार्थान्<BR>सृञ्जयांश् च महारथान् । निःशेषान्<BR>समरे कुर्यात् पश्यतोर् नौ जनार्दन ॥ )<BR>8. 57. 8; later, Kuru warriors and Sṛñjayas<BR>fought with one another using straight-<BR>flying and very sharp arrows (शरैस्<BR>तदाञ्जोगतिभिः सुतेजनैः) 8. 57. 67; once<BR>again a very severe fighting broke out<BR>between Kurus and Sṛñjayas in which they<BR>used besides arrows weapons like swords,<BR>शक्तिस्, lances, maces and परश्वधस् 8.<BR>62. 40; when Karṇa was killed, Arjuna was<BR>honoured by Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others<BR>8. 69. 37; on the seventeenth night (निशि 8.<BR>1. 25) while reporting Karṇa's death to<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra Saṃjaya told him that Karṇa,<BR>before his death, had killed Kekayas and<BR>Videhas in the presence of all Sṛñjayas<BR>and Pāñcālas (स सृञ्जयानां सर्वेषां<BR>पाञ्चालानां च पश्यताम् । केकयानां<BR>विदेहानाम् अकरोत् कदनं महत् ॥ ) 8. 2.<BR>18; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya who among<BR>the Kurus and Sṛñjayas were dead and who<BR>were alive 8. 4. 3; (30) On the eighteenth<BR>day, when Śalya became the general the<BR>Madras encouraged him saying that he<BR>was capable of defeating in battle even<BR>gods and demons, let alone mortals like<BR>Somakas and Sṛñjayas 9. 6. 9; a fierce battle<BR>was fought by Sṛñjayas with Kurus which<BR>terrorized Kurus (कुरूणां भयवर्ध-<BR>नम्) 9. 8. 1; as a result of the battle<BR>there began to flow a terrific river (नदी<BR>रौद्रा) filled with the bodies of Kurus<BR>and Sṛñjayas (कुरुसृञ्जयसंकुला) 9. 8.<BR>32; seeing the heroic deeds (विक्रमम्) of<BR>Śalya, Duryodhana considered Pāṇḍavas,<BR>Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas (as good as) dead<BR>(निहतान् … मेने) 9. 12. 28; finally, when<BR>Śalya was killed, Pāṇḍavas and Śṛñjayas<BR>chased the shattered (प्रभग्नान्) army<BR>of Kauravas 9. 18. 28; when Śālva, riding<BR>an elephant, attacked the Pāṇḍava army,<BR>Sṛñjayas and others thought his swiftly<BR>moving single elephant, to be several<BR>thousands (सहस्रशो वै विचरन्तम्<BR>एकम्) 9. 19. 6; when the Pāṇḍava army<BR>was broken, Kaurava heroes blew, in joy,<BR>their conches; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the general<BR>of the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,<BR>could not bear the sound of the roar indi-<BR>cative of the joy of Kauravas (8. 19. 10);<BR>seeing the (heroic) deeds of Śālva, Sṛñjayas<BR>and others encircled his elephant 9. 19. 21;<BR>during the war of eighteen days eleven<BR>अक्षौहिणिस् of Duryodhana's army were<BR>killed by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 9. 28.<BR>14; Duryodhana felt confident to defeat<BR>Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with<BR>mace as his weapon 9. 31. 30; Bhīma<BR>told Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by Sṛñjayas<BR>(सृञ्जयैः सह तिष्ठन्तम्), that he was<BR>prepared to accept the challenge of Duryo-<BR>dhana 9. 32. 28; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas<BR>applauded Duryodhana's words asking<BR>Bhīma to prove his words (दर्शयस्व<BR>बलं युद्धे) 9. 32. 49-50; when Balarāma<BR>came to witness the duel between Bhīma<BR>and Duryodhana, he embraced Pāṇḍavas<BR>and Sṛñjayas and enquired about their<BR>well being (अपृच्छत् कुशलं सर्वान्) 9.<BR>33. 11; Duryodhana asked Yudhiṣṭhira,<BR>along with Sṛñjayas, to watch the duel<BR>9. 54. 38-39; when Duryodhana was forced<BR>to kneel down by Bhīma, Sṛñjayas raised<BR>a loud roar; hearing their roar, Duryo-<BR>dhana was enraged 9. 56. 54-55; when<BR>Bhīma felled down Duryodhana he told<BR>Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas that he<BR>had killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra on<BR>the strength of Draupadī's तपस् (रणे<BR>हतांस् तपसा याज्ञसेन्याः) 9. 58. 9-10;<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya what did the<BR>Sṛñjayas do when Duryodhana was struck<BR>down; Saṃjaya told him that they waived<BR>their upper garments and raised a loud<BR>roar; the earth was unable to bear them<BR>who were filled with delight (आविध्यन्<BR>उत्तरीयाणि सिंहनादांश् च नेदिरे । नैतान्<BR>हर्षसमाविष्टान् इयम् सेहे वसुन्धरा ॥ )<BR>9. 60. 3-4; some shook their bows, others<BR>their bow-strings; still others blew their<BR>large conches or struck the दुन्दुभिस्; some<BR>made sportive gestures, others laughed<BR>(चिक्रीडुस् तथैवान्ये जहसुश् च) 9. 60.<BR>5-6; they praised Bhīma's act in so many<BR>words and were happy that he had brought<BR>the enmity to an end (वैरस्य च गतः<BR>पारम्); they said that the horripilation<BR>experienced by them at the time of Duryo-<BR>dhana's fall had not yet subsided (दुर्यो-<BR>धनवधे यानि रोमाणी हृषितानि नः । अद्यापि<BR>न विहृष्यन्ति तानि … ) 9. 60. 7-16; Kṛṣṇa<BR>told Sṛñjayas not to rebuke Duryodhana<BR>anymore because he was already killed when<BR>he refused to give Pāṇḍavas their share<BR>although advised to do that, among others,<BR>by them (°गाङ्गेवसृञ्जयैः । … प्रोच्य-<BR>मानो ऽपि) 9. 60. 20; (31) During the<BR>massacre which took place at night of the<BR>eighteenth day, Aśvatthāman killed Pāṇḍava<BR>warriors and Sṛñjayas who were without<BR>weapons and armours and were agitated<BR>(अपेतशस्त्रसंनाहान् संरब्धान् पाण्डु-<BR>सृञ्जयान्) 10. 8. 74;

Kau-<BR>ravas and Pāṇḍava-Somakas sat together<BR>before the start of the war and mutually<BR>agreed upon certain conventions and<BR>rules to be followed in the war (ततस् ते<BR>समयं चक्रुः कुरुपाण्डवसोमकाः ।<BR>धर्मांश् च स्थापयाम् आसुर् युद्धानाम्<BR> … ॥ ) 6. 1. 26, 33; the conventions and<BR>rules detailed in 6. 1. 27-32; (8) Duryo-<BR>dhana told Duḥśāsana that if Bhīṣma was<BR>protected in war he would kill Pāṇḍavas,<BR>Somakas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; (9) When<BR>Arjuna got prepared for the war Somakas<BR>and others blew their conches 6. 41. 2;<BR>(10) On the second day of the war,<BR>Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Somakas showered<BR>arrows on Droṇa 6. 48. 30; (11) On the<BR>third day, Kṛṣṇa noticed Bhīṣma routing<BR>Somakas chased by the delighted Kauravas<BR>(प्रभग्नान् दृश्य सोमकान्) 6. 55. 68;<BR>(12) On the fifth day, when Bhīṣma<BR>started killing Pāñcālas and Somakas, they<BR>acted nobly and decided to attack Bhīṣma<BR>(आर्यां युद्धे मतिं कृत्वा भीष्मम्<BR>एवाभिदुद्रुवुः) 6. 68. 31; (13) On the<BR>sixth day, Śikhaṇḍin surrounded by Soma-<BR>kas and Irāvant stood at the ‘tail’ of<BR>the Makaravyūha of Pāṇḍavas (पुच्छे<BR>मकरस्य) 6. 71. 4, 11; Somakas were<BR>terrified (वित्रेसुः) to hear the sound of<BR>Droṇa's conch when he blew it after defeat-<BR>ing Drupada 6. 73. 46; (14) On the eighth<BR>day, when the Pāṇḍava army attacked<BR>Bhīṣma he killed Pāñcālas, Somakas and<BR>Sṛñjayas with his arrows; nevertheless,<BR>abandoning the fear of death they attacked<BR>Bhīṣma (त्यक्त्वा मृत्युकृतं भयम्)<BR>6. 84. 2-4; battle that ensued, in which<BR>Bhīṣma cut off their hands and heads and<BR>felled down those riding chariots, horses<BR>and elephants (विरथान् रथिनश् चक्रे;<BR>हयेभ्यो हयसादिनाम्; निर्मनुष्यांश् च<BR>मातङ्गाञ् … ), described in 6. 84. 5-7;<BR>when Droṇa attacked Somakas and Sṛñjayas<BR>in order to kill them (अभ्यद्रवत …<BR>प्रेषयिष्यम् यमक्षयम्) a loud cry was<BR>raised by Sṛñjayas (by implication also by<BR>Somakas) (तत्राक्रन्दो महान् आसीत् सृञ्ज-<BR>यानाम्) 6. 85. 20-21; that night, Karṇa<BR>assured Duryodhana that he would kill all<BR>Pārthas and Somakas if Bhīṣma laid down<BR>his arms and left the battlefield 6. 93. 13;<BR>Duryodhana then went to Bhīṣma and<BR>reminded him that he had assured him<BR>(Duryodhana) to kill Somakas; he asked<BR>Bhīṣma to carry out his assurance by killing<BR>Somakas 6. 93. 37-38; thereupon Bhīṣma<BR>once again assured Duryodhana that next<BR>day he would either kill Somakas and Pāñ-<BR>cālas to delight him or they would kill<BR>him (तैर् वाहं निहतः संख्ये गमिष्ये<BR>यमसादनम् । तान् वा निहत्य संग्रामे<BR>प्रीतिम् दास्यामि वै तव ॥ ) 6. 94. 14-15;<BR>(15) On the ninth day, in the morning,<BR>Duryodhana asked the kings to get ready<BR>with their armies since Bhīṣma was going<BR>to kill that day Somakas (अद्य भीष्मो …<BR>निहनिष्यति सोमकान्) 6. 95. 1; at mid-day,<BR>Bhīṣma fought a fierce battle with Somakas<BR>blowing them away by hundreds and thou-<BR>sands with his sharp arrows (व्यधमन्<BR> … शतशो ऽथ सहस्रशः) 6. 99. 1-2;<BR>in the evening when the sun had set<BR>(भास्करे ऽस्तम् उपागते 6. 103. 1), Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira seeing that great chariot-fighters<BR>among Somakas had been defeated and<BR>had lost enthusiasm (जितान् दृष्त्वा … निरुत्-<BR>साहान् महारथान्) felt like ordering<BR>cessation of hostilities for that day (अव-<BR>हारम् अरोचयत्) 6. 103. 4; (16) Dhṛta-<BR>rāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how, on the tenth<BR>day, did Bhīṣma face Pāṇḍavas while at<BR>the same time killing Somakas 6. 104. 25;<BR>Dhṛṣṭadyumna, aided by Somakas, attack-<BR>ed Droṇa 6. 111. 30; Bhīṣma, when attack-<BR>ed by Śikhaṇḍin, killed Somakas who<BR>followed Arjuna (पार्थपदानुगान्) 6.<BR>112. 64; none of the great chariot-fighters<BR>of Somakas hoped to live after facing<BR>Bhīṣma in battle (न … यः संप्राप्य रणे<BR>भीष्मं जीविते स्म मनो दधे) 6. 112.<BR>75; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas<BR>and Sṛñjayas rushed at Bhīṣma showering<BR>weapons on him from all sides (अभ्यद्र-<BR>वन्त … शस्त्रवृष्ट्या समन्ततः) 6. 113.<BR>16-17; Somakas and Pāñcālas were delight-<BR>ed when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 107;<BR>(17) On the fourteenth day, when Droṇa<BR>started killing Somakas no one succeeded<BR>in facing him, nor was any one able to<BR>pierce him (with an arrow) (न चाप्य-<BR>भिययुः केचिद् अपरे नैव विव्यधुः) 7.<BR>85. 34; watching the fierce duel between<BR>Satyasena and Sātyaki, Kauravas and<BR>Somakas praised them 7. 94. 7; in the<BR>afternoon of that day, Droṇa again fought<BR>with Somakas (अपराह्णे … संग्रामः<BR>समपद्यत । … पुनर् द्रोणस्य सोमकल्ः)<BR>7. 101. 1; when the different alignments of<BR>the Pāṇḍava army were being agitated by<BR>Droṇa (व्यूहेष्व् आलोड्यमानेषु), Pāṇḍavas,<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas went deep into the<BR>army of Kauravas (सुदूरम् अन्वयुः); the<BR>battle fought was so fierce that it looked<BR>like the end of the world (युगान्त इव<BR>भारत) 7. 102. 1-2; when Bhīma<BR>marched to offer assistance to Arjuna,<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas followed him 7.<BR>102. 67; after the death of Jayadratha, in<BR>the evening (अस्तं गच्छति भास्करे),<BR>Droṇa fought a fierce battle with Somakas<BR>(सोमकैः सार्धम् संग्रामो लोमहर्ष-<BR>णः); at that time great chariot-fighters<BR>of Somakas made every attempt to kill<BR>Droṇa (ते तु सर्वे प्रयत्नेन भारद्वाजं<BR>जिघांसवः । … अयुध्यन्त महारथाः ॥ )<BR>7. 121. 45-46; Droṇa sent a message to<BR>Aśvatthāman through Duryodhana not to<BR>spare Somakas in order to save his own<BR>life (न सोमकाः प्रमोक्तव्या जीवितं<BR>परिरक्षता) 7. 126. 33; (18) In the<BR>night war (which took place between the<BR>fourteenth and the fifteenth day), Duryo-<BR>dhana assured his fleeing army that he<BR>would himself kill Pārthas together with<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas 7. 134. 54: Duryo-<BR>dhana requested Aśvatthāman to kill<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas who, agitated, were<BR>moving in his army like a conflagration;<BR>he should kill them before they killed<BR>Kauravas (एते हि सोमका … मम सैन्येषु<BR>संरब्धा विचरन्ति दवाग्निवत्) 7. 134.<BR>76-78; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana<BR>that for his sake and to delight him he<BR>would fight with Pāñcālas, Somakas and<BR>Kekayas (एष गच्छामि संग्रामे त्वत्-<BR>कृते … । … त्वत्प्रियार्थम्); scorched by<BR>his arrows, Somakas and others would<BR>run away in all directions; seeing his<BR>valour, Yudhiṣṭhira and Somakas would<BR>consider the world full of Aśvatthāman<BR>(अश्वत्थाममयं लोकं मंस्यन्ते);<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira would be dejected seeing the<BR>slain Pāñcālas and Somakas; Aśvatthāman<BR>would kill only those who engaged him in<BR>battle (ये मां युद्धे ऽभियोत्स्यन्ति तान्<BR>हनिष्यामि … ); once Somakas were within<BR>his reach they would not return alive 7.<BR>135. 10-14; in the battle that followed<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas fled 7. 135. 20;<BR>Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas, Matsyas and Somakas<BR>followed Arjuna and Bhīma to attack Droṇa<BR>from right and left respectively (बीभत्सुर्<BR>दक्षिणं पार्श्वम् उत्तरं तु वृकोदरः)<BR>7. 136. 13-14; Duryodhana advised his<BR>brothers to offer protection to Droṇa so<BR>that he would be able to kill Pārthas,<BR>Somakas and Sṛñjayas along with their<BR>kings (सोमकान् हन्यात् सृञ्जयांश् च सरा-<BR>जकान्) 7. 139. 21, 24; in the midst of the<BR>fierce night war (रौद्रे रात्रियुद्धे),<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira exhorted Pāṇḍavas and Soma-<BR>kas to attack Droṇa alone in order to kill<BR>him; accordingly, they attacked Droṇa<BR>uttering frightening cries (अभ्यद्रवत<BR>गच्छध्वं द्रोणम् एव जिघांसया । …<BR>द्रोणम् एवाभ्यवर्तन्त नदन्तो भैर-<BR>वान् रवान्) 7. 140. 2-3; when Karṇa's son<BR>Vṛṣasena cut off the armours of Drupada's<BR>army, Somakas, frightened, fied (सोमका<BR>विप्रदुद्रुवुः); while they were running<BR>away they appeared bright due to the light<BR>of the torches (ततस् तु द्रुपदानीकं<BR>शरैश् छिन्नतनुच्छदम् । संप्राद्रवत्<BR> … । द्रवमाणाश् च सोमकाः व्यराजन्त …<BR>प्रदीपैर् अवभासिताः); after defeating<BR>great Somaka charriot-fighters Vṛṣasena<BR>turned towards Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 143. 21, 24-<BR>25, 28; when Śikhaṇḍin, defeated by Kṛpa<BR>turned back, Somakas and others covered<BR>him on all sides; then the battle started<BR>again 7. 144. 25, 27-28; seeing Droṇa kill-<BR>ing the Pāṇḍava army (पाण्डवीं चमूम्),<BR>Somakas quickly pierced him by showering<BR>arrows (विव्यधुः सोमकास् तूर्णं …<BR>शरवृष्टिभिः); but Droṇa deprived them<BR>of their lives 7. 147. 13-14; Kṛṣṇa drew<BR>Arjuna's attention to Bhīma who, cover-<BR>ed by Somakas and the Pāṇḍava army,<BR>attacked Droṇa and Karṇa (वृतः सोमक-<BR>पाण्डवैः) 7. 147. 28; when only the three<BR>parts of the (last quarter of the) night<BR>remained and the sun was about to rise,<BR>Droṇa divided his army into two parts and<BR>attacked Somakas and Pāṇḍavas along with<BR>Pāñcālas (त्रिभागमात्रशेषायाम् रात्र्यां;<BR>अरुणो ऽभ्युदयां चक्रे) 7. 161. 1-3 (Nī.<BR>on Bom. Ed. 7. 186. 1; त्रिभागमात्रशेषा-<BR>यां मुहूर्तत्रयावशिष्टायाम्); (19) On<BR>the fifteenth day, Droṇa released ब्राह्म<BR>missile trying to kill all Somakas (विनिघ्नन्<BR>सर्वसोमकान्) 7. 164. 80; just before the<BR>fall of Droṇa, Kurus and Somakas got<BR>mixed up with one another in a battle<BR>shouting and felling each other with wea-<BR>pons (ततः प्रवृत्ते संग्रामे विमिश्राः<BR>कुरुसोमकाः । … शस्त्रैर् देहान् अपात-<BR>यन् ॥ ) 7. 165. 99; when the fleeing Pāñcāla<BR>warriors did not return to fight they were<BR>made to stand still where they were by<BR>Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna (7. 171. 67-69; 7. 172.<BR>1-2); only Arjuna, along with Somakas<BR>and the constituents of their armies (?)<BR>returned to fight with Aśvatthāman (एक<BR>एव तु बीभत्सुः सोमकावयवैः सह)<BR>7. 172. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 201. 3;<BR>सोमकावयवैः सोमकानाम् अवयवरूपैर्<BR>माण्डलिकैः); (20) On the sixteenth day,<BR>when Aṅgas attacked Nakula, Pāṇḍavas,<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas attacked them to<BR>cover Nakula (नकुलं … परि पेतुः …<BR>पाण्डुपाञ्चालसोमकाः); then chariot-<BR>fighters fought with elephant-riders (रथि-<BR>नां हस्तिभिः सह) 8. 17. 21-22; when<BR>Somakas were being killed by the arrows<BR>of Karṇa, afflicted by pain and wounded<BR>by arrows, they hid themselves (अवालीयन्त<BR>राजेन्द्र वेदनार्ताः शरार्दिताः); (the<BR>Kaurava army too, being killed by Nakula,<BR>dispersed in all directions); the two armies<BR>then, standing beyond the range of arrows,<BR>chose to act as spectators (ते सेने …<BR>प्रेक्षकवत् स्थिते) 8. 17. 73-75; (21)<BR>Even after the battle of the sixteenth day,<BR>Dhṛtarāṣṭra was confident that Karṇa alone<BR>was capable of killing Pāṇḍavas and Soma-<BR>kas 8. 22. 16; (22) On the seventeenth<BR>day, Arjuna felt that by killing Karṇa he<BR>would give satisfaction to the great chariot-<BR>fighters of Somakas for having fulfilled<BR>their task to help their allies in war (कृतं<BR>कार्यं च मन्यन्तां मित्रकार्येप्सवो<BR>युधि) 8. 52. 25; Karṇa in the afternoon<BR>(अपराह्णे) of that day killed all Somakas<BR>in the presence of Bhīma 8. 56. 7, 53;<BR>Arjuna expressed his fear to Kṛṣṇa that<BR>if Kṛpa, Kṛtavarman and Aśvatthāman<BR>were not killed they would cause the des-<BR>truction of Somakas (अवध्यमानास् ते<BR>ऽस्माभिर् घातयिष्यन्ति सोमकान्) 8. 57. 5;<BR>Karṇa fought a great battle with Somakas<BR>in which he crushed them while destroy-<BR>ing their chariots and killing horses and<BR>elephants (सुमहत् … चक्रे युद्धं सोम-<BR>कान् संप्रमृद्नन्) 8. 60. 14; when Karṇa<BR>came up to Arjuna to kill him, Somakas<BR>urged (अभ्यक्रोशन्) Arjuna to hasten to<BR>pierce Karṇa (with an arrow), cut off his<BR>head without delay and shatter the hope<BR>of Duryodhana to get kingdom (विध्य<BR>कर्णम् । छिन्द्ध्य् अस्य मूर्धानम् अलं<BR>चिरेण श्रद्धां च राज्याद् धृतराष्ट्र-<BR>सूनोः) 8. 65. 10; when Karṇa cover-<BR>ed (समाचिनोत्) Arjuna with a hundred<BR>Kṣudraka arrows and pierced (बिभेद)<BR>Kṛṣṇa with sixty arrows, Somakas fied;<BR>Arjuna stopped them (तदन्तरं सोमकाः<BR>प्राद्रवन्त । … पार्थः सोमकान् प्रत्य-<BR>गृह्णात्) 8. 65. 32-34; seeing Karṇa lying<BR>dead on the ground, Somakas, delighted,<BR>made loud noise, sounded musical instru-<BR>ments and shook their (upper) garments<BR>and hands; others danced and embraced<BR>each other saying: “Karṇa is pierced with<BR>an arrow as fire is extinguished by a strong<BR>wind at the end of a sacrifice or at day-<BR>break in a bedroom; Karṇa's body with<BR>arrows all over it and smeared with blood<BR>shines like sun with his rays; the sun in<BR>the form of Karṇa has been forced to set<BR>by Kāla in the form of Arjuna; as the sun<BR>while setting takes away his light, so has<BR>the arrow taken away Karṇa's life” 8.<BR>67. 28-32; after the death of Karṇa, in the<BR>evening, at the foot of the Himavant<BR>(हैमवते प्रस्थे 9. 5. 1) and near the<BR>river Sarasvatī (9. 4. 49), Śalya when<BR>requested by Duryodhana to lead the army<BR>(9. 5. 26-27), he (Śalya) assured him that<BR>he would defeat Pārthas and Somakas in<BR>battle 9. 6. 3; after Śalya's election as the<BR>general, the great chariot-fighters of Madra-<BR>kas while praising Śalya said that he was<BR>capable of defeating in battle even gods,<BR>demons and men, let alone Somakas and<BR>Sṛñjayas (किमु सोमकसृञ्जयान्) 9. 6. 9;<BR>that night, in the camp of Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa<BR>encouraged Yudhiṣṭhira to fight with Śalya;<BR>after he left, Yudhiṣṭhira gave leave to<BR>Pāñcālas and Somakas to leave his camp<BR>(विसृज्य पाञ्चालान् अथ सोमकान्) 9. 6. 39;<BR>(23) On the eighteenth day when Bhīma<BR>attacked Kṛpa, the great chariot-fighters of<BR>Somakas too attacked him and others in<BR>order to kill their opponents (अभ्य-<BR>द्रवन्त … जिघांसन्तः परान् युधि) 9.<BR>7. 31; Somakas fell down by thousands<BR>due to the arrows of Śalya; after a while,<BR>Śalya again struck down Somakas and<BR>Pāṇḍava army and caused distress to Yudhi-<BR>ṣṭhira (सोमकाश् च सहस्रशः । पतिताः;<BR>शल्यो ऽपि … निघ्नन् सोमकपाण्डवान् । …<BR>युधिष्ठिरम् अपीडयत्) 9. 10. 21, 41;<BR>when Yudhiṣṭhira announced his decision<BR>to kill Śalya, the army of Pāṇḍavas, espe-<BR>cially the Pāñcālas, Somakas and Matsyas,<BR>expressed delight which helped the fulfil-<BR>ment of Yudhiṣṭhira's vow (i. e. encouraged<BR>him) (ततः प्रहर्षः सैन्यानां … पाञ्चा-<BR>लानां सोमकानां मत्स्यानां च विशेषतः ।<BR>प्रतिज्ञां तां च सङ्ग्रामे धर्मराजस्य<BR>पूरयन्) 9. 15. 26-27; seeing Śalya, killing<BR>his opponents, angered Somakas and others,<BR>surrounded him (परिवव्रुः) 9. 16. 6;<BR>after the death of Śalya, when the Madra<BR>army attacked the Pāṇḍava army, Somakas<BR>and others covered Yudhiṣṭhira on all<BR>sides to protect him (युधिष्ठिरं परी-<BR>प्सन्तः समन्तात् पर्यवारयन्) 9. 17. 8;<BR>Somakas and others thought that the ele-<BR>phant of king Śālva (9. 19. 2-3), though<BR>one, was moving in thousand forms around<BR>them (तम् एव नागं ददृशुः समन्तात् ।<BR>सहस्रशो वै विचरन्तम् एकम्) 9. 19. 6;<BR>Duryodhana alone halted (अवारयत्) with<BR>his sharp missiles the attack of Somakas<BR>and others 9. 20. 34; Aśvatthāman assured<BR>Duryodhana who had taken shelter in the<BR>Dvaipāyana lake that he would kill Soma-<BR>kas and others on that very day (अद्य<BR>निहनिष्यामि सोमकान्) 9. 29. 19; when<BR>Duryodhana's whereabouts became known,<BR>delighted Somakas shouted loudly (प्रा-<BR>क्रोशन् सोमकास् तत्र) 9. 29. 48; Somakas<BR>and others held Duryodhana in high regard<BR>(सर्व एवाभ्यपूजयन्) when he cha-<BR>llenged Bhīma to prove his boasts 9. 55.<BR>40; after the duel began, Somakas and<BR>Pāṇḍavas were afraid when they noticed<BR>the velocity of the wind produced by<BR>Duryodhana's mace (गदा मारुतवेगं हि<BR>दृष्ट्वा) 9. 56. 31; when at one stage<BR>Bhīma lost consciousness due to the stroke<BR>of Duryodhana's mace on his chest, Soma-<BR>kas and Pāṇḍavas, their hopes dashed to<BR>the ground, became dejected (भृशोपहत-<BR>संकल्पा नहृष्टमनसो ऽभवन्) 9. 56.<BR>49; Somakas were thrilled to see Duryo-<BR>dhana fall down (ददृशुः हृष्टरोमाणः)<BR>9. 58. 2; the chief warriors among Somakas,<BR>who were righteous, did not approve of<BR>Bhīma's putting his foot on the head of<BR>fallen Duryodhana (नाभ्यनन्दन् धर्मा-<BR>त्मानः सोमकानां प्रबर्हाः) 9. 58.<BR>13; (24) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya<BR>whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman took part<BR>in destroying the camp of Pāṇḍavas and in<BR>killing them and Somakas while fighting,<BR>and then go the way Duryodhana did<BR>(i. e. die in battle) (कच्चित् प्रमथ्य<BR>शिबिरं हत्वा सोमकपाण्डवान् । दुर्यो-<BR>धनस्य पदवीं गतौ परमिकां रणे ॥ )<BR>10. 8. 3; while moving in the camp, Aśva-<BR>tthāman happened to see the sons of Drau-<BR>padī and the surviving Somakas (अव-<BR>शिष्टांश् च सोमकान्) 10. 8. 44; as far as<BR>the destruction of Somakas, who were<BR>asleep and not on their guard, was con-<BR>cerned that night proved to be extremely<BR>cruel (एवंविधा हि सा रात्रिः सोमकानां<BR>जनक्षये । प्रसुप्तानां प्रमत्तानाम् आसीत्<BR>सुभृशदारुणा ॥ ) 10. 8. 142; Aśvatthāman<BR>was delighted that Somakas and the Mat-<BR>syas who had survived were all killed by<BR>him; he felt that he and his associates<BR>had done their duty; he wanted to give<BR>that very delightful news to Duryodhana<BR>if he was still alive (सोमका मत्स्यशेषाश्<BR>च सर्वे विनिहता मया ॥ इदानीं कृत-<BR>कृत्याः स्म … । यदि जीवति नो राजा तस्मै<BR>शंसामहे प्रियम् ॥ ) 10. 8. 150-151.<BR>C.

Kuṇḍa-<BR>dhāra figures in an ancient narrative<BR>(इतिहासं पुरातनम्) told by Bhīṣma to<BR>Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his question:<BR>What is most profitable among the three<BR>Puruṣārthas viz. धर्म, अर्थ and काम<BR>(2. 263. 1-2); in the narrative, Kuṇḍadhāra<BR>obliges a Brāhmaṇa due to affection for<BR>his devotee (कुण्डधारेण यत् प्रीत्या<BR>भक्तायोपकृतं पुरा) 12. 263. 2-55;<BR>the narrative runs as follows: A certain<BR>poor Brāhmaṇa desired to obtain wealth<BR>in order to perform a sacrifice; he therefore<BR>worshipped many deities but did not get<BR>wealth; he then wondered which could be<BR>that one deity which would show him favour<BR>quickly; he then saw standing near him<BR>the cloud Kuṇḍadhāra (जलधरं कुण्ड-<BR>धारं st. 6) who appeared before him<BR>assuming an agreeable form (सौम्येन<BR>वपुषा st. 6); the Brāhmaṇa felt assured<BR>by Kuṇḍadhāra's form and felt that he<BR>would definitely give him ample wealth;<BR>the Brāhmaṇa became his devotee and<BR>worshipped Kuṇḍadhāra with incenses,<BR>perfumes, garlands and oblations (ततो<BR>धूपैश् च गन्धैश् च माल्यैर् उच्चावचैर्<BR>अपि । बलिभिश् चापि … , st. 9); the cloud,<BR>satisfied, told the Brāhmaṇa that there were<BR>expiations for the sins committed due to<BR>killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, theft,<BR>breaking a vow, but there was no expiation<BR>for the sin of ungratefulness (कृतघ्ने<BR>नास्ति निष्कृतिः st. 11); अधर्म was the<BR>child of craving, anger of envy, greed of<BR>insult (निकृत्याः), and that an ungrateful<BR>person did not deserve progeny (कृतघ्नो<BR>नार्हति प्रजाम् st. 12); then the Brāhmaṇa,<BR>lying on the कुश grass, due to the lustre<BR>(तेजस्) of Kuṇḍadhāra, saw in a dream<BR>(निदर्शनम् अपश्यत st. 14), Maṇibhadra<BR>distributing kingdoms and wealth as desir-<BR>ed by gods (मणिभद्रं व्यादिशन्तम् … ।<BR>तत्र देवाः प्रयच्छन्ति राज्यानि च<BR>धनानि च st. 15-16); Kuṇḍadhāra fell<BR>at the feet of Maṇibhadra; Maṇibhadra, at<BR>the instance of gods, asked Kuṇḍadhāra<BR>what he desired; Kuṇḍadhāra replied that if<BR>the gods were satisfied with him they should<BR>show that kind of favour to the Brāhmaṇa<BR>which would lead him to happiness (अस्या-<BR>नुग्रहम् इच्छामि कृतं किंचित् सुखो-<BR>दयम् st. 19); again, at the instance of<BR>the gods, Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra<BR>that he was willing to give the Brāhmaṇa<BR>as much wealth as desired by him; Kuṇḍa-<BR>dhāra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth)<BR>was fickle, decided to fix the Brāhmaṇa's<BR>mind on practising austerities (विचार्य<BR>कुण्डधारस् तु मानुषं चलम् अध्रुवम् ।<BR>तपसे मतिम् आधत्त ब्राह्मणस्य यशस्-<BR>विनः) 12. 263. 22; Kuṇḍadhāra therefore<BR>told Maṇibhadra that he would not seek<BR>wealth for the Brāhmaṇa, but that the<BR>Brāhmaṇa be devoted to धर्म; he desir-<BR>ed that the Brāhmaṇa should take delight<BR>in धर्म and should live following the<BR>धर्म (भवेद् एष तु धार्मिकः । धर्मे<BR>ऽस्य रमतां बुद्धिर् धर्मं चैवोप-<BR>जीवतु । ) 12. 263. 25; when Maṇibhadra<BR>persisted on giving the Brāhmaṇa kingdom<BR>and various kinds of happiness since that<BR>was what one aspired to get by follow-<BR>ing धर्म, Kuṇḍadhāra did not change<BR>his mind and wanted his Brāhmaṇa devotee<BR>to live following the धर्म; the gods<BR>were pleased with him; Maṇibhadra told<BR>Kuṇḍadhāra that the gods were satisfied<BR>with him and that the Brāhmaṇa's mind<BR>would be fixed on धर्म and that he would<BR>be a धर्मात्मा; Kuṇḍadhāra was delight-<BR>ed for having obtained what was desired in<BR>the form of a boon not easily obtained by<BR>others; the Brāhmaṇa saw thin garments<BR>around him but his mind was not deluded;<BR>abandoning them, he went to the forest<BR>and practised severe austerities; he felt that<BR>if he so desired he could certainly give<BR>some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39);<BR>at that juncture Kuṇḍadhāra again appeared<BR>before the Brāhmaṇa due to his friendship<BR>with him and the severe austerities per-<BR>formed by him; the Brāhmaṇa, surprised,<BR>received him according to the rites; Kuṇḍa-<BR>dhāra told the Brāhmaṇa that he had now<BR>obtained the highest divine insight (दिव्यं<BR>ते चक्षुर् उत्तमम् 12. 263. 42) and by<BR>using it the Brāhmaṇa should see the ulti-<BR>mate fate of the kings and the worlds<BR>they would get; then the Brāhmaṇa by his<BR>divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in<BR>the hell; Kuṇḍadhāra wondered that if the<BR>Brāhmaṇa, after worshipping him was to<BR>get unhappiness, what kind of favour had<BR>he done to him ? He therefore asked the<BR>Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to<BR>realize that it was futile to run after various<BR>longings because the door to heaven was<BR>closed for such men (कामान् इच्छेद् कथं<BR>नरः । स्वर्गद्वारं हि संरुद्धं मानु-<BR>षेषु विशेषतः ॥ 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa<BR>then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear,<BR>arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder<BR>men from going to heaven (ततो ऽपश्यत् स<BR>कामं च क्रोधं लोभं भयं मदम् ।<BR>निद्रां तन्द्रीं तथालस्यम् आवृत्य पुरुषान्<BR>स्थितान् ॥ 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again<BR>told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned<BR>before, stopped men from going to heaven;<BR>gods were afraid of such men; (these vices),<BR>as ordained by the gods, create obstacles<BR>all around (तथैव देववचनाद् विघ्नं<BR>कुर्वन्ति सर्वशः ॥ 12. 263. 47); no one<BR>who was not permitted by gods could be<BR>virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his auste-<BR>rities, could confer kingdoms and wealth<BR>on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet<BR>of the cloud (तोयधारिणे i. e. Kuṇḍa-<BR>dhāra) and told him that he had done a<BR>great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍa-<BR>dhāra to forgive him for having formerly<BR>envied him (पुरा ते यद् असूयितम्) due<BR>to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra<BR>embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that<BR>he had forgiven him and then disappeared;<BR>the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the<BR>skies due to his austerities to which he was<BR>led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness<BR>he also gained what he wanted and the<BR>highest bliss (विहायसा च गमनं तथा<BR>संकल्पितार्थता । धर्माच् छक्त्या तथा<BR>योगाद् या चैव परमा गतिः ॥ ) 12. 263.<BR>53.
