2. Ghaṭotkaca: (No. 1, L. 28; No. 47, L. 1; No. 53, LL. 1-2;
No. 46, L. 1; No. 49, L. 1; No. 50, L. 1; No 40, L. 3;
No. 21, L. 4:
The inscriptions name Mahārājā Ghaṭotkaca as the successor
of Gupta. He should not be confused with Ghaṭotkacagupta
whose name occurs on some seals found at Vaīśālī, and also
in the Tumain Inscription of Kumāragupta and Ghaṭotkaca-
gupta (G. E. 116).^46
Ghaṭotkaca was the name of a son of Bhīma-sena by the
Rākṣasī Hiḍimbā.^47 Names based on Ghaṭa are very rare in
Sanskrit literature. Thus Gaṇeśa is named Ghaṭodara ‘pot-
bellied’.^48 The name Ghaṭotkaca refers to the practice of
bearing traditional names based on Epics and Purāṇas. Deriva-
tively it means a person having a hairless head.^49 In Prācīna
Caritrakośa it has been suggested that Ghaṭotkaca was so
called as his head was like a ghaṭa (pitcher) and was hairless.^50
Tripathi suggests on the basis of the Skanda Purāṇa that
Ghaṭotkaca was so called as he produced a loud voice while
laughing which may be compared to the voice produced by
thumping the pitcher quite aloud at its mouth by hands.^51 But
the first derivation seems to be more plausible from linguistic
point of view^52 while the other explanation may be more
important from socio-psychological or mythological point of
view.
It is possible that it was the nickname of Ghaṭotkaca which
might have become his famous name.

3. Candragupta I: (No. 47, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2; No. 40, L. 3;
No. 21, L. 5; No. 1, L. 28; No. 30, L. 1):
While his two predecessors are each given the title of
Mahārāja, Candragupta I is described in the inscriptions as
Mahārājādhirāja, ‘king of kings’. Mookerjee connects the passage
from the Purāṇas defining the extent of the Gupta territory
with the period before Samudragupta, i.e., under Candragupta
I.^53 It has been suggested that Caṇḍasena of the play ‘Kaumudī-
Mahotsava’ is to be identified with Candragupta I. The
Licchavi alliance is the common point in the account given by
the drama and the inscriptions.^54 Other details of the drama,
however, do not support this identification. The drama
condemns Caṇḍasena as an usurper and belonging to low caste
whom the citizens of Magadha could not tolerate and drove out
to die in exile. Linguistically also Caṇḍasena and Candragupta
are different names. Candra can become Caṇḍa in Prakrit but
Gupta cannot be transformed into Sena. Moreover, in the fifth
act of the play we are informed through a character Lokākṣī
that the cursed Caṇḍasena has been killed and his royal family
uprooted.^55 Thus we know about the total annihilation of the
dynasty after the death of Caṇḍasena which is not applicable
to the dynasty of Caṇḍragupta which ruled for several genera-
tions after him.^56 The name of the deity Candra ‘moon’ has
been given to this king; Gupta is the surname. It may refer
to his handsome physical features.

13, L. 4; No. 12, L. 19):
He is introduced as Mahārājādhirāja in all references except
the Mathurā Pillar Inscription of Candragupta II, G.E. 61^57
where he is mentioned as Bhaṭṭārakamahārāja rājādhirāja. He
was the daughter's son of the Licchavis, and son of Mahārājā-
dhirāja Śrī Candragupta I born on the queen Kumāradevī.^58
He has been mentioned as a ‘Paramabhāgavata’ (a devout
devotee of Lord Viṣṇu).^59 No. 2, L. 10 gives the justification
of his name Samudragupta.^60 Mookerji says that the name
Samudragupta was probably a title assumed after his conquests.
It means ‘protected by the sea’ and may refer to his dominion
which extended upto the sea. The Mathurā Inscription of
Candragupta II actually describes the fame of his conquests as
extending up to the four oceans (caturudadhisalilāsvāditaya-
śasaḥ). The name Samudragupta may be split up into two parts,
Samudra being his personal name, and Gupta being his
surname. This is supported by the fact that the obverse of his
coins of standard type sometimes bears the legend ‘Samudra’
while the reverse has ‘Parākramaḥ’ as his title. The name
‘Samudra’ also appears on some other types of his coins, such
as the Archer type and Battle-Axe type.^61 Mookerji^62 holds that
Samudragupta's personal name was Kāca and that Samudra-
gupta was his title. But the identification of Kāca with
Samudragupta has been rightly opposed by scholars.^63 Vāmana
in his Kāvyalaṃkāra^64 refers to Candraprakāśa as the son of
Candragupta which Goyal takes to be another name of
Samudragupta.^65 But it seems to be the name of a local king of
Ayodhyā rather than that of a member of the Imperial Gupta
dynasty.^66 Another probable and most suitable explanation
of the name ‘Samudragupta’ may be ‘protected by Lord Śiva’,
Samudra being an epithet of Śiva.^67
Samudragupta is given many epithets in No. 1. Some of
these are also supported by numismatic evidence.^68

of his chief queen Dattadevī;^69 or as Bhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja,
the good son of the Bhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja, the illustrious
Samudragupta;^70 or in one case simply as a king (rājā) in No.
30, L. 1. In No, 46, L. 3, L. 4. his title is ‘Vikramāditya’. He is
mentioned by other names as well. Devarāja as his favourite
name (priyanāma) is mentioned in No. 5, L. 7.^71 In the Poona
copper plate inscription of Prabhāvatīguptā and the Ridhapura
grants of Prabhāvatīguptā her father's name is Candragupta.^72
The Chammak copper plate inscription of Vākāṭaka king
Pravarasena II, however, names Prabhāvatīguptā's father as
Devagupta.^73 This proves that Devagupta was another name
of Candragupta. Candragupta had a third name, Deva-Śrī,
which appears on his Archer and Conch-types of Coins.^74 No.
32, L. 2 Justifies his name Candragupta ‘who is like a moon
in the galaxy of Gupta kings with the famous name Candra-
gupta’.^75 No. 20, L. 5 refers to his quality of handsomeness.
‘His name was Candra and he was holding the glory of a full
moon on his face’.^76

6. Govindagupta: (No. 42, L. 2; No. 32, L. 3):
In No. 42, he is mentioned as the son of Candragupta II. His
mother's name was Dhruvasvāminī. No. 32 explains the basis
of his name: “The lord of the earth, i.e. king Candragupta,
produced a son whose exalted name was Govindagupta, who
was as famous as Govinda (Viṣṇu) for the glory of his virtues,
and who resembled the sons of Diti and Aditi, i.e. the demons
and gods.”^77 The poet means that Govindagupta resembled
demons in physical strength and valour, and gods in spiritual
virtues.
Govindagupta probably ruled as emperor between (his
father) Candragupta II and (his younger brother) Kumāra-
gupta 1. His reign could not have been more than three years,
the interval between the last known date of Candragupta II
(G. E. 93) and the earliest known date of Kumāragupta I (G.E.
96).^78 P. L. Gupta assigns his short regnal period between
A.D. 412 and 415.^79 That Govindagupta could have ruled as
emperor only for a very short period is also evident from the
fact that he has left no coins. Being a collateral, Govindagupta
does not appear in the genealogical table in the inscriptions of
Kumāragupta and his successors.^80
It is also likely that Kumāragupta defeated or ousted
Govindagupta and seized the throne; and after his accession,
avoided all references to his elder brother.^81

No. 31, L. 1; No. 39, L. 3; No. 46, L. 4; No. 35,
LL. 1-2; No. 34, L. 2):
No. 30, L. 2 says that Śrī Candragupta's son Kumārgupta
resembled the great Indra (Mahendra), who embraced and
protected the whole earth.^82 In No. 53, L. 5 Kumāragupta is
mentioned as ‘Mahārājādhirāja’ son of ‘paramabhāgavata
Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Candragupta’ born of the cheif queen
Dhruvadevī. He has been mentioned as father of Pūrugupta
and son of Candragupta II.^83 In No. 30, L. 4 Kumāragupta is
described as shining (ruling) over the earth like the Sun in the
winter. He is called ‘Paramabhaṭṭāraka’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’
in No. 31, L. 1. In No. 46, L. 4 he is mentioned only by
his title ‘Mahendrāditya’, and as the grandson of Samudragupta
and son of Candragupta II. The Ārya-Mañju-Śrī-Mūlakalpa
corroborates the title giving his name as Mahendra.^84 In
No. 34, L. 2 he is mentioned as ‘Paramadaivata’, ‘Parmabhaṭṭā-
raka’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’.
Of the two parts of his name Kumāra is the name of god
Skanda (or Kārttikeya)^85 and Gupta was his surname.

8. Skandagupta (No. 15, L. 3; No. 46, LL. 7-8; No. 14,

described as equal to the Cakravartins in prowess and valour, to
Rāma in righteousness and to Yudhiṣṭhira in the matter of
speaking the truth and in good conduct and modesty.^87
According to some scholars^88 these are vague praises; but in
view of his achievements these epithets seem to be richly
deserved. In No. 14, L. 2 he is described as ‘rājarājādhirāja’,
and as ‘Paramabhāgavata’ and ‘Mahārājādhirāja’ in No. 12,
LL. 23, 25.
The name is based on god Skanda which is a synonym of
Kārttikeya.

9. Pūrugupta (No. 47, L. 6; No. 53, L. 6; No. 49, L. 6;
No. 50, L. 6; No. 38, L. 1):
We know from No. 53 that Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Pūrugupta
was the son of Mahārājādhirāja Śrī Kumāragupta by his chief
queen Anantadevī. In No. 38, L. 1 the name of the father
and predecessor of Narasiṃhagupta is spelt as Pūrugupta.^89
The reading Pūrugupta is unmistakeable on the fragmentary
Nālandā Seal of Narasiṃhagupta and is also fairly clear
on the seals of Kumāragupta II. The medial ū sign in
the first letter of the name Pūrugupta is indicated by an
additional stroke attached to the base of the letter and the
downward elongation of its right limb; mere elongation of the
right limb by itself would have denoted the short medial u as
in puttras in LL. 2 and 3. In the second letter of the name,
viz. ru. the medial u is shown by a small hook turned to left
and joined to the foot of r. Palaeographical considerations
apart, the name Purugupta yields a more plausible-sense than
Puragupta and fits better in the series of the grand and digni-
fied names of the Gupta kings. The first part of the Gupta
names constituted the real or substantive name and yielded
satisfactory meaning independently of the latter half, viz.
gupta, which being family surname was a mere adjunct. Pura,
by itself is neither a complete nor a dignified name while Puru
is both. Pūru or its variant Puru may, like Vainya in Vainya-
gupta signify the homonymous epic hero of the lunar race
who was the ancestor of the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, or
may mean abundant or great.^90

10. Kumāragupta II: (No. 48, L. 5):
Kumāragupta II was the immediate successor of Pūrugupta
in the light of the data given in two dated inscriptions, viz. the
Sarnath Buddha Stone Image inscriptions of Kumāragupta and
Budhagupta. The first (No. 48) mentions A.D. 473 as the date of
Kumāragupta who must, therefore, be taken as Kumāragupta II
and the second (No. 54) mentions A.D. 476 as the date of
Budhagupta. No. 48 records the date, Gupta year 154^91 when
Kumāragupta was protecting the earth.^92 The renovation of the
Sun temple mentioned in No 17, LL. 20-21 seems to have taken
place in his reign.^93 It seems that Mookerji has by mistake,
connected the reference^94 meant for Kumāragupta I with
Kumāragupta II.^95 The temple was originally constructed in the
reign of Kumāragupta I in M.S. 493 = A.D. 436 (L. 19).

11. Budhagupta: (No. 54, L. 1; No. 55, L. 2; No. 18, L. 2;
No. 33, L. 1; No. 53, L. 8):
Nos. 54, 55, 18 and 33 respectively mention him as reigning in:
G.Y. 157, 159, 163 and 165. No. 33 gives his titles as ‘parama-
daivata’, ‘paramabhaṭṭāraka’ and ‘mahārājādhirāja’. In No. 53
he is mentioned as the son of Pūrugupta born of the queen
Candradevī.^96 In No. 55 his title is Mahārājādhirāja. Accord-
ing to Sircar there is no space for the name of any other
Gupta prince between Pūrugupta and Bhudhagupta and their
relationship is clearly mentioned by the word ‘putra’ occurring
at the end of line 6.^97 In other words pūrugupta was the
father of Budhagupta.
In his description of Nālandā, Hiuen Tsang says that the
monastic establishments at that place were enriched by the
successive endowments of Śakrāditya, Budhagupta, Tathāgata-
gupta and Bālāditya.^98 On the strength of this statement it has
been suggested that Budhagupta was the son of Kumāragupta I
who had the title of Mahendrāditya (Mahendra = Śakra).^99
In view of the clear epigraphic reference to the parentage of
Budhagupta the proposed identification must be rejected.^100
The statement of Hiuen Tsang was based on hearsay and not
on sound history, or else his Budhagupta is not to be identified
with Budhagupta of the Imperial Gupta line.
The name Budhagupta is based on Mercury. Budhism had
quite a prominent place in the time of Budhagupta. But in view
of the special leaning of Gupta kings towards the brahmanical
faith we prefer to interpret Budha as referring to Mercury
either as god Mercury (regarded as a son of Soma or the Moon)
or as the planet Mercury.^101

12. Narasiṃhagupta: (No. 47, L. 8; No. 49, L. 7; No. 50,

Narasiṃhagupta has been mentioned as ‘Paramabhāgavata’ and
‘Mahārājādhirāja’. Hiranand Shastri^102 says that the seal of
Narasiṃhagupta (No. 47), though not entire is valuable in
establishing his identity as the son of Pūrugupta born of the
the queen consort Śrī Vainyadevī and not Vatsadevī as has
hitherto been believed. But the correct reading of the name of
her mother is Śrī Candradevī, on his seal.^103 In No. 50. L. 6
we find his mother's name as ‘Vatsadevī’. In No. 49 he is
mentioned as the father of Kumāragupta III. No. 38 describes
the issuer of this seal, Viṣṇugupta, as the son and successor of
Kumāragupta III, who in his turn was the son and successor
of Narasiṃhagupta.
Narasiṃha is the name of Viṣṇu in his fourth incarnation
(Avatāra), half man and half lion who slew the demon Hiraṇya-
kaśipu and saved the life of Prahlāda.^104

Viṣṇugupta (and the wife of Kumārgupta III) has been lost in
the portion of the last line.
The Kalighat hoard^105 contained besides Candragupta II's
coins those of Narasiṃhagupta, Kumāragupta III and Viṣṇu-
gupta. Altekar identified Viṣṇugupta of the coins with the
homonymous ruler of the later Gupta family of Magadha,
who flourished in the eighth century A.D.^106 At that time the

Viṣṇugupta.

वैन्यगुप्त
2. Vainyagupta: (No. 51, L. 5; No. 52, L. 1):
Vainya is the synonym for the first king ‘Pṛthu’.^109 Hiranand
Shastri mentions Vainya as a synonym of Kubera, the god of
wealth. According to Sir Richard Burn Vainya was another
name of Vajra whom Hiuen Tsang mentions as the son of
Bālāditya. He chiefly relies on the St. Petersburg dictionary
where Vainya is derived from Vena and is connected with
Indra; Vajra is the thunderbolt and Vainya is a patronymic
from Vena who is Indra.^110 But the suggested identification is
extremely far-fetched. Vajra cannot by any stretch of imagina-
tion be described as a synonym of Vainya. Moreover, it is diffi-
cult to believe that Hiuen Tsang would have referred to the
king by such a name in preference of the real name.
In No. 51 Vainyagupta is mentioned as a paramabhāgavata
and mahārājādhirāja, but in No. 53 he is described as a devotee
of Lord Śiva (bhagavān mahādevapādānudhyāta) and a mahārāja
only. Some scholars hold the opinion that it shall be wrong to
disconnect Vainyagupta from the Gupta family on the basis of
the argument that the Guptas were Vaiṣṇavas while Vainya-
gupta professed to be a Śaiva.^111 We find both the epithets
‘paramabhāgavata’ and ‘mahādevapādānudhyāta’ for him in our
records.
It is interesting that even his Pādadāsa and Uparika are
styled as mahārājas (LL. 3 and 16). His title Mahārāja, there-
fore, cannot prove that Vainyagupta was an insignificant
prince.^112
The legend on No. 51, though partially preserved, resembles
in point of style the legend on the other seals of the Imperial
Guptas. Here Vainyagupta is specifically called paramabhāgavata.
Moreover, his name, like those of other kings in the Gupta
dynasty ends in the word Gupta. It is thus clear that Vainya-
gupta belonged to the line of the Imperial Guptas. He seems
to have ruled in any case over considerable parts of Bengal and
Bihar^113 almost immediately after Budhagupta. We do not
know anything about the relationship of Vainyagupta with
Budhagupta and Bhānugupta of the Eraṇ Inscription of A.D.
510.^114 Some scholars assign him a reign of four years before
Bhānugupta (A.D. 510).^115
The regnal period of Vainyagupta witnessed a considerable
decline in the power and prestige of the Imperial Guptas. The
rise of the ruling dynasty consisting of Dharmāditya, Gopa-
candra and Samācāradeva in Central and South-West Bengal
in the first half of the sixth Century A.D., possibly points to
the extirpation of Gupta rule from Bengal excepting the
bhukti (province) of Puṇḍravardhana (North Bengal).^116

3. Bhānugupta (No. 19, L. 5):
He is known only from No. 19. His no other coin or seal has
yet come to light. As regards the position of Bhānugupta, seve-
ral alternatives are possible. First, he may have been a succes-
sor of Vainyagupta and the dominions of both may have
included parts of Eastern Malwa. Second, Vainyagupta may have
been the lord of the eastern part of the Gupta Empire when its
western part was being ruled by Bhānugupta. Third, Bhānu-
gupta may have been a viceroy in the Malwa region like
Govindagupta and Ghaṭotkacagupta. It is possible that he be-
longed to the Imperial Gupta line but whether he succeeded
Vainygupta, or the two ruled at the same time respectively
over the western and eastern parts of the empire, is difficult to
determine. The latter view seems more probable and this in-
ternal dissension perhaps paved the way for the downfall of the
empire.^117 Bhānugupta, in spite of the high encomiums paid to
his bravery in Eraṇ Inscription, remains a shadowy figure, and
we do not know what was his position in the Gupta Imperial
family, or what part he played in the dark days of the Gupta
empire.^118
His name is based on the god Sun ‘Bhānu’.

appears as the wife of Candragupta II and mother of Kumāra-
gupta I. It is not much likely that Candragupta II had two
queens with almost identical names. As the real name of the
two is the same (Dhruva) it would be better to hold that
Dhruvasvāminī was another name of Dhruvadevī and Kumāra-
gupta I and Govindagupta were real brothers.

highly probable that her name was Candradevī, known from
some seals to have been the name of the queen of Pūrugupta.
Hiranand Shastri takes the relevant legend to be ‘Śrīvainya-
devyām’^122 but regards the correct reading to be Candra in place
of Vainya.^123

name may mean ‘born by the grace of a Nāga’. D.C. Sircar
takes the compound as a Caturthī Tatpuruṣa instance mean-
ing ‘dedicated to a Nāga’. However, the compounds are usually
taken as Tṛtīyā Tatpuruṣa instances. The names do not indi-

Nāgadatta may exhibit reverence to Guru, Śiva or Nāga by
whose worship or blessings the son was born which is attested
to by tradition of such names.

capital or territory is not mentioned. Probably he was the con-
temporary local chief of Daśapura and a feudatory ally of the
Guptas in their struggle against the Hūṇas.^9 Dattabhaṭa does
not include in the inscription the genealogy of his master. It is
possible that Prabhākara was a self-made man who did not
have a distinguished ancestor worthy of record. He may have
been appointed as a ruler of Daśapura by the paramount
power, after the extinction of the Varman dynasty.^10 That
Prabhākara was not a scion of the Varman dynasty would also
appear from his name which, unlike the names of the known
members of that dynasty, does not end in Varman.^11 The
name violates the laws of Gṛhyasūtras which forbid the direct
imposition of the names of deities upon human-beings.

अच्युतनन्दिन्
1. Acyutanandin (No. 1, L. 21):
He is included in the list of kings of Āryyāvartta forcefully
uprooted by Samudragupta. Acyuta is the name of Viṣṇu or
Kṛṣṇa,^12 and Nandin is the name of an attendant of Śiva and
also the name of Śiva's bull.^13 So literally the expression would
mean ‘one who is a servant of god Visṇu’. Nandin also means
gladdening or rejoicing.^14 So it may also mean ‘one who
pleases or wins over god Viṣṇu’.
Acyutanandin seems to have been a ruler of Ahicchatra
(near Bareilly district).^15 The Purāṇas give names ending in
‘Nandin’ in the list of Nāga kings and coins bearing ‘Acyuta’
have been found from Ahicchatra.^16 Therefore, it is possible
that Ahicchatra was a seat of government of Acyutanandin.

kās^21 and may refer to the prevalence of the Mātṛ cult. The
name is formed by the similar process of the combination of
the names of two deities, Mātṛ and Viṣṇu. Mātṛ if taken as a
short form for the Vedic Mātariśvan, together with Viṣṇu
would mean Agni and Viṣṇu an interpretation that is relevant

king Puṣyamitra, the contemporary of Patañjali appears as

The meaning of the first part is not clear. It is clearly not a
Sanskrit word. As Woolner has pointed out words with cereb-
rals are often non-Āryan or influenced by non-Āryan elements.^35
Another possibility is that these names show dialectal elements.
Even now-a-days we give names like Maṇṭu, Baṇṭu, etc., to
little children. There is also a possibility that the Sanskrit
word ‘mantra’ meaning ‘a hymn or magical formula’ got
changed to ‘maṇṭa’ through a process of Prakritization, or
we may derive it from an artificial root ‘maṇṭ’ to act as
intermediator.^36

The name is based on the animal Vyāghra, or tiger imply-
ing that in Mahākāntāra his subordinate chiefs were like tigers
and he was their ruler. The name is a good selection in the
context of the fact that the region of Mahākāntāra is known to
have been infested with tigers.

‘one who protects with his power’.

Bandhuvarmman was the son of Viśvavarman. He was probably
a feudatory chief, ruling at Dasapura, Mandasor in Western
Malwa,^41 in the time of Kumāragupta I. He has been men-
tioned as a king (nṛpa) governing the city of Daśapura and
it was under his rulership that the Sun-temple was caused to
be built by the guild of silk-cloth weavers at Mandasor (Daśa-
pura). The relevant lines in the inscription lay a stress on his
name Bandhu. He is described as possessed of firmness and
statesmanship; beloved of (his) kinsmen; the relative, as it were,
of (his) subjects; the remover of the afflictions of (his) con-
nections; pre-eminently skilful in destroying the ranks of (his)
proud enemies.^42 Varman is a kṣatriya surname meaning
‘the protector’, the entire expression may literally be trans-
lated as ‘the protector of his relatives’.

Kādrava by metathesis becomes Kārddava which literally
means ‘born of Kadru’. In south, among aboriginal people
and lower castes, the practice of matriarchal names is well

inscription which has been termed as a kāvya.^59
Hari is Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa and sena is to be obtained from
Sanskrit senā. The name can be explained in two ways.
That Hari is his personal name and ṣeṇa or sena his surname.
We may also explain it is, ‘one with Hari as his army’. The
Mahābhārata informs us that there was only big army on the side
of the Kauarvas and there was only Hari, i.e., Lord Kṛṣṇa on
the side of the Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas could get Hari on
their side by foregoing the Yādava army to the Kauravas.

of the ‘Praśasti’ inscribed on the Meharauli Iron Pillar
Inscription by Śāba alias Vīrasena who was an accomplished
poet and a favourite minister of Candragupta II, Vikramā-

meaning ‘the happy one’ and is the name of Viṣṇu, Śiva and
an attendant of Śiva. This name-ending was not known in the
time of Pāṇini. According to Sankalia names directly after
deities were probably after the family-god,^23 which in the pre-
sent case seems to have been Śiva. It is possible that the first
part of the name was connected with same deity and than the
name of the family-deity was added as the name-ending surname.
The word nandin is generally used to refer to ‘an attendant
of Śiva’ or the vāhana ‘nandīn’ bull of Śiva. So the name
Divākarnandin may literally mean ‘an attendant of god Sun’.
The word Nandin also means ‘gladdening’.^24 So another inter-
pretation can be ‘one who pleases or wins over Lord Sun’.

कामनकुण्ड
1. Kāmanakuṇḍa (No. 43, L. 11):
It should be taken as Kāmanākuṇḍa. The word kāmanā means
‘desire’. The second part ‘kuṇḍa’ seems to be a family surname.
Literally it means a bowl, pitcher, a vessel for coals, or a round
hole in the ground (for receiving and preserving water or fire.
Cf. Agnikuṇḍa).^22 It is a Dravidian word.^23 We have the
names of mohallas ending in ‘kuṇḍa’, such as Durgākuṇḍa,
Agastyakuṇḍa, Lakṣmīkuṇḍa in Vārāṇasī.
As a surname, we find its use for the Nāgara brāhmaṇas.^24
We find many brāhmaṇa surnames popular among the kāyas-
thas of Bengal.^25 ‘Kuṇḍa’ though originally a brāhmaṇa sur-
name is now a non-brāhmaṇa surname in Bengal. Some of the
people possessing the kuṇḍa surname are found to be oil-men
by profession. Its corrupt form kuṇḍu is also found.

has been mentioned as the great grand-father of the brāh-
maṇa Devaviṣṇu, the giver of an endowment for the maintenance
of a lamp in the temple of the god Sun.
It is an abbreviated name with the ending “ika”^12 like
Devika for Devadatta; Yajñika for Yajñadatta and Chadika
for Chandodatta.^13
The name ‘Ḍaḍḍa’, ‘Ḍuḍḍa’ or ‘Ḍuḍḍā’^14 cannot be
derived from any Sanskrit root. Nor are these names found
in any Sanskrit or Prakrit dictionary. Dr. H.D. Sankalia
suggests that these names were derived from the Sanskrit
term Dardara,^15 meaning ‘a mountain’, or a region having
holes or ravines. The man may have shifted from a hilly
region.
We find references to geographical names like ‘Daddara-
pabbata’ and ‘Mahādaddara’ in the Daddara Jātaka.^16 The
Daddarapabbata may be identified with the mountainous tract
of Dardistan, lying to the north-west of Kashmir, and south
of Little Pamir. Since the river Sindhu after its origin in the
Himalayas near Tibet flows through this country, Pāṇini calls
the river Dāradī Sindhuḥ.^17
The people of this tract, the Daradas are mentioned in the
Mahābhārata in the list of the foreign tribes which sprang up
along with the Yavanas, Mlecchas and Śakas, from the cow
Kāmadhenu, when she was being forcibly driven away by
Viśvāmitra from Vasiṣṭha's āśrama.^18 The Daradas are the
people, living above Peshawar.^19 But the basic weakness in the
suggestion made by Dr. H.D. Sankalia^20 is, as he himself
admits, these names are not found in any Sanskrit or Prakrit
dictionary.
It may be noted that the words Ḍoḍa and Ḍoḍḍa are syno-
nyms used for a brāhmaṇa and Ḍoḍiṇī stands for a brāhmaṇī,
or a brāhmaṇa-woman.^21 These are deśya words and hence
refer to local elements.
In Punjabi language a person who is very simple or credu-
lous or who can be very easily cheated is called ‘Ḍoḍa’. It is
not unlikely that on account of his pious ways and bookish
approach a brāhmaṇa was generally taken to be a simple
person. In the Sanskrit story books the picture of a typical
brāhmaṇa is that of a simpleton who can be easily duped.
Hence it is possible that a brāhmaṇa was called ‘Ḍoḍa’ and
the feminine form of ‘Ḍoḍa’ (i. e. Ḍoḍiṇī) was used for a
brāhmaṇa-womaṇ.^22
In Karnataka ‘Ḍoḍḍu’ means ‘big’ or elder. ‘Ḍoḍḍācārya’
or ‘Ḍuḍḍācārya’ a term of respect for a learned Paṇḍita is also
used in satire.
It is interesting to note that Ḍaḍḍa is also an English slang
word meaning ‘a foolish person’.

1. Abhayamitra (No. 48, L. 2; No. 54, L. 2):
The name consisting of two parts ‘abhaya’ and ‘mitra’ can
mean a friend of unfearfulness or ‘an unfearful friend’. ‘Abhaya’
is also the name of Lord Śiva^28 and ‘mitra’ is a synonym for
the god Sun. Thus it may also be a name formed by combining
the names of two deities as in the case of Rāmakṛṣṇa. Abhaya-
mitra was the name of a Buddhist monk who caused a pratimā
to be built.

भट्टिभव
3. Bhaṭṭibhava (No. 31, L. 2):
The image on which the Mathurā Jaina Inscription of Kumāra-
gupta I, of G. E. 113 is inscribed was set up by Śāmāḍhyā (Śyāmā-
ḍhyā), the daughter of Bhaṭṭibhava. Bhaṭṭibhava seems to have
been a brāhmaṇa-follower of Jainism. Bhaṭṭa or Bhaṭṭi, a surname
meaning ‘a teacher’ has been put here before Bhava. Bhaṭṭi is
the Prakritised form of Sanskrit ‘Bharti’ meaning a lord or
master which came to be accepted as a Sanskrit word. ‘Bhava’
means ‘a god, deity’ and is also the name of Lord Śiva.
Bhava also means ‘prosperity, welfare’.^30 Thus the full name
literally means ‘one who is a (source of) prosperity, for his
teacher’. It can also be a case of a name after the deity ‘Bhava’
or ‘Śiva’.

just like a Soma (a life-giving element) for his teacher.” It can
as well be a case of a name after the deity Soma.

He was a Jaina ācāryya. The correct form of the name should

form. According to Monier Williams^31 ‘Dattila’ is one of the
forms of names terminating in ‘datta’. Names like Devadatta

Skanda’. Guhanandin was the name of a Jaina Ācāryya.
The names of the Digaṃbara Ācāryas of the third and
fourth centuries, such as Yaśonandin Jayanandin, and Kumāra-
nandin generally end in nandin. As Puṇḍravardhana was one
of the seats of Jaina pontiffs, beginning with Gupti-Gupta or
Viśākhācāryya, the disciple of Bhadrabāhu II, it has been
suggested that Guhanandin also belonged to the same place.^35

has won the body’, i.e. one having control over one's senses’.

of the Buddhist order.^37

‘Somadatta’ may be addressed as ‘Somī;’ Somila may be a similar
form convenient to utter. Somila can also be formed by adding

legend about him runs thus — The demon Bali, by his austeri-
ties acquired the dominion over the three worlds, and caused
annoyance and anxiety to the gods. Viṣṇu then reincarnated
himself as a dwarf, appeared before Bali, and asked for as
much land as he could cover with three strides. Bali assented
to his request, and Viṣṇu with two strides covered the heavens
and the earth, but, in commiseration for Bali, who then
humbled himself, left him the dominion over the lower
regions below the earth.^59 We get a reference to this legend
as early as in the Viṣṇusūkta of the Ṛgveda.^60

बुद्ध
2. Buddha (No. 23, LL. 6-7):
He has been given the epithet ‘The Divine’ (Bhagavān Buddha).

the name means awakened, conscious or intelligent. For
Buddhists it stands for a fully enlightened man who has
achieved perfect knowledge of the truth and thereby is liberated
from all existence and before his own attainment of Nirvāṇa
reveals the method of obtaining it. The principal Buddha of
the present age was born at Kapilavastu in the year 566 B.C.^61
His father Śuddhodana was the Rājā of that district. His
mother was Māyādevī, and his original name was Siddhārtha.
He belonged to the Kṣatriya Śākya tribe, while Gautama
seems to refer to the race to which his family belonged. He
had left his home in quest of truth and after a concentrated
meditation for a few years attained the discovery of truths
and was called the Buddha or the enlightened.^62

first king who introduced agriculture. Due to scarcity of
supply when people complained of hunger, he armed his
arrow and the earth was milked. Hilly tracts were levelled
and different kinds of villages, cities and towns were organised
for the first time. Pṛthu has been panegyrised by the Gandhar-
vas, and Siddhas playing on different musical instruments.^68

name of a person it signifies an arranger, compiler or narrator.
Vyāsa is said to have rearranged the Vedas into four parts,
and taught each of them to four respective pupils — Paila,
Vaiśaṃpāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu; he also rearranged
Itihāsa — Purāṇas and composed the Bhārata and the Bhāga-
vata.^76 Subsequently, the name Vyāsa came to be applied to
any great typical compiler or author.^77 He was the son of the
sage Parāśara and was brought forth by his mother Satyavatī
on an island in the river Yamunā. Hence he is also known
as Dvaipāyana and Bādarāyaṇa.^78 As he was called Kṛṣṇa-
Dvaipāyana, it seems that Vyāsa, Dvaipāyana, and Bādarāyaṇa
were epithets; his original name might have been Kṛṣṇa due to
his dark complexion,^79 and he was called ‘Dvaipāyana for
being born on an island (dvīpa).’

Amarakośa gives a better explanation which takes us nearer
to the original meaning. It explains ‘Dāman’ as ‘Sandānam’,
i. e., a rope tethered to a cow at the time of milking it.^2 The
second part of the name is ‘svāminī’ which means ‘a propri-
etress, mistress’ or owner of (gen., loc. or comp.).^3
The parents might have given her this name out of affec-
tion as she was a helping hand in tethering the rope to the
cow while milking it.^4 The name indicates affection by the
parents.

Sircar the simile may further suggest that some maternal uncle
of Skandagupta actually fought against him in support of his
rival and that his mother, possibly not the chief queen of his
father, had to experience difficulties for sometime. ^6
Devakī is a patronymic formed by adding ‘ī’ suffix to
Devaka, literally meaning ‘divine, celestial’, who was her
father.^7 She was the wife of Vasudeva and the mother of
Kṛṣṇa.^8

Monier Williams mentions the form with short ‘i’ suffix (Rāmi)
but it can be with long ‘ī’ as well, as we have ‘Devakī’ a
patronymic from Devaka.^13 Chatterji mentions it to be a
feminine form of Rāma and considers it a naming pattern
prevalent among the lower classes^14

The form of the name should have better been Sabhāṭi. She
was the mother of Dāmasvāminī who raised a pillar in her

The name seems to have some relation with the word
Sabhā.^15 It can be an adjective from the word Sabhā combined
with §‘aṭ’ to move. Literally it may mean “one who moves
in assemblies”.

आभीर
1. Ābhīra (No. 1, L. 22):
They were one of the tribes subdued by Samudragupta.
Ābhīras lived to the north of the Rajaputana desert. We may
also think of Abiravan between Herat and Kandahar which
may have been the original home of the Ābhīras. In the 3rd
century A.D. there was an Ābhīra kingdom in the north-
western Deccan.^21 D.C. Sircar^22 describes Ābhīra in singular as
a member of the Cowherd Community. The tribe can still be
traced in the present Ahīras,^23 who in tribal groups, abound
largely in the Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nepal and some portions
of Rajasthan. They are a band of simple, sturdy people,
mostly cowherds and agriculturists.^24 This tribe^25 is thought to
have played a big part in the propagation of the worship of
Kṛṣṇa Govinda^26 in his pastoral aspect.
The Mahābhārata^27 places the Ābhīras in West Rajasthan
‘where the Sarasvatī disappears’.
In the first and second centuries A.D. they are located in
the country between the lower Sindhu valley and Kathiawar,
as is indicated in the ‘Periplus’ and in the Geography of
Ptolemy.^28 The Periplus calls their country Abiria. Ābhīra
generals served in the armies of Śaka Kṣatraps of Western
India in the second century A.D. as is known from their
inscriptions.^29 They are also mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya
of Patañjali^30 in association with the Śūdras, the Sodrai of
Alexander's time, who lived in northern Sind. Throughout
the third century A.D. the Ābhīras exercised ruling power in
northern Konkan and Mahārāshtra.^31 Vātsyāyana^32 refers to
the Harem of the Ābhīra kings. The Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa^33
and the Vāyu Purāṇa^34 refer to them as ‘Dakṣiṇāpatha-vāsinaḥ’
or dwelling in the Southern Country. The Bṛhat-saṃhitā^35
mentions them as being under the jurisdiction of Śani
(Saturn).
The Jodhpur Inscription of Saṃvat 918, records that the
Ābhīra people of this area were a terror to their neighbours,
because of their violent demeanour.^36 The Ābhīra robbers are
also mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa.^37 Epigraphic evidence
indicates the existence of an Ābhīra kingdom in the 14th
Century in Khandesh.^38
In the Sāhitya Darpaṇa of Viśvanātha,^39 it is stated that
Ābhīrī is the language of the Ābhīras and Cāṇḍālī of the
Caṇḍālas. Those who do woodwork can speak Ābhīrī or Śābarī,
either of the two. Daṇḍin asserts that the speeches of the
Ābhīras, etc., are termed as Apabhraṃśa in the Kāvya^40 on
the basis of which probably Keith writes: “the Prakrit lyrics
passed into Apabhraṃśa as a result of the activities of the
Ābhīras and the Gurjaras.^41 We know from the Amarakośa^42
that ‘Ābhīrī’ was used to denote ‘Ābhīra woman or the wife of
a cowherd’.
The Amarakośa^43 mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṃkhya,
Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Ābhīra and says that
the village or place where Ābhīras lived is named as Ghoṣa or
Ābhīrapallī.^44
In the Kashmirian recension of the Mahābhārata we get
the readings ‘Kābhīra’ and ‘Kabhīra’ in place of Ābhīra.^45
These Kashmirian forms may have resulted from an attempt
to record an initial glottal opening in the language of the
Ābhīras. The Kasmiras probably knew the Ābhīras at an early
date.^46
Bhattacharya^47 describes the Ābhīrs or Ahīrs as a cowherd
caste exceeding 8,000,000, and found almost everywhere in
India north of the Narmadā. The Ābhīras are mentioned as
foreigners in the Purāṇas.^48 Their kings were regarded as
vrātya and mostly śūdras (black).^49 In the Mahābhārata the
Ābhīras are called Mleccha.^50 According to Manu^51 they were
the sons of a brāhmaṇa man and an ambaṣṭha woman, the
Ambaṣṭhas being of mixed origin and known as the Ānava
kṣatriyas.^52 The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^53 places the Ābhīras in the
Southern quarter of India.
Shafer^54 considers them to be an admixture possibly of
white Iranian blood with enough Bhil blood to give them a
a very dark colour and concludes that they were western
Ānavas.^55

आर्जुनायनस्
2. Ārjunāyanas (No. 1, L. 22):
One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta.
The name Ārjuneya is mentioned in the Ṛgveda as the
patronymic of Kautsa.^56 The tribe, associated with the name
of Arjuna, existed in the Punjab and the North-West up to
the advent of Gupta power in the fourth century A.D.^57 The
word Arjuna in the Vedic literature^58 denotes ‘white’ and
‘white lepresy’ and is also an epithet of Indra. But it does not
denote a tribe or a human hero.
The word Arjuna has an unmistakable resemblance with
the Śaka word erzuna, meaning a ‘leader’ or ‘chief’ which is
derived from arzi. Analogous to it are the Śaka words aljsā,
meaning ‘silvery’ and āljsata, meaning ‘silver’, that are akin to
the Avestan word erezata (silver), the Sanskrit word rajata
(silver) and the Persian word arziz (tin).^59 All these words have
the original sense of whiteness and brightness, that are also
connoted by the word arjuna in Sanskrit. It is highly significant
that Arjuna, the hero of the Mahābhārata, is said to have borne
this name, because he was ‘white’ and ‘pure’ in action.^60 All
over the Eurasian steppes the nobles were regarded as ‘white’
and the commoners were considered ‘black’. Hence the word
for white colour was employed to denote the idea of leadership.
This is why erzuna was used in the sense of a ‘leader’ in Śaka
languages.^61
Vedic and Śaka both branched from the same parent Indo-
European language. Hence many words were common to both.
But whereas arjuna in Vedic lost its pristine sense and was
only used as an adjective, signifying ‘whiteness’, in Śaka it
meant a ‘tribe’ and a human hero and later on this sense was
imparted to this word in India as a result of the impact of the
Śakas.^62
The tribe, bearing the name of Arjuna, was also connected
with some people of Chinese Turkestan, whose heroes, and
kings had this designation.^63 In the Uighur redaction of the
Hiḍimbāvadha^64 the name of Arjuna occurs in the form of
Arcuni.^65 According to Sylvain Levi, this episode of the Mahā-
bhārata owed the privilege of entering into the Turkish world
to the presence of the name of Arjuna in it, who was regarded
as the eponymous founder of the dynasties of some Central
Asiatic oases-states.^66
Pāṇini^67 refers to the worshipper of Arjuna, called Arjunaka,
together with the devotee of Vasudeva, called Vāsudevaka.
This remark implies that Arjuna was treated as a deity at the
time of Pāṇini and his followers occupied a prominent posi-
tion. ^68 The Kāśikā replaces Auddālakāyana of Patañjali by
Ārjunāyana,^69 the name of a tribe nearer to its own time in
discussing the meaning of Prācya-bhārata (II. 4. 66).
From the accounts relating to the invasion of India by
Alexander we learn that a tribe named Agalassoi (Arjunāyana)
fought with Alexander.^70
The Bṛhat-saṃhitā^71 places the Ārjunāyana in the northern
division of India and describes them as being in the region of
Bṛhaspati.^72
Ptolemy refers to a people in the Punjab whom he calls
Pandoouoi^73 = Pāṇḍavas with whom the Ārjunāyanas may be
connected.^74 Ārjunāyana coins are found in the Mathurā
region and ‘they may be assigned with probability to the region
lying west of Agra and Mathura, equivalent, roughly speaking,
to the Bharatpur and Alwar States’.^75

आटविकराज
3. Āṭavika-rāja (No. 1, L. 21):
It is stated in the inscription that Samudragupta made all the
kings of the forest countries his servants.^76 A mention
of the forest kingdoms has also been made in Khoh Copper
plate inscription of Saṃkshobha Gupta year 209.^77 These
18 forest kingdoms were apparently in Central India
including Ḍāhala or the Jabalpur region. ^78 We find a refe-
rence to the same in the Kanas plate of Lokavigraha.^79
The Vāyu and Matsya Purāṇas (XLV, 126 and CXIII, 48)
read Āṭavyas which is no doubt the correct reading. Āṭavī as
a city of the Deccan is mentioned in the Mahābhārata.^80 The
Āṭavyas were certainly the same as the Āṭavikas of the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription and were perhaps aboriginal
tribes dwelling in the jungle tracts of Central India.^81 We find
a reference to the Āṭavikas or the forest savages in the
Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya and it was an Arthaśāstra practice
to hire the Āṭavikas as scouts and army auxiliaries,^82 which
needs must influence their future advance to civilization.
Āṭavika-rāja should be translated as ‘forest-kings’ or ‘kings of
forest countries’. We get a reference to Jāṅgalas in the Puranic
List of Peoples.^83 Similar terms ‘vana-rāṣṭra’ ‘forest-countries’
and vana-rājya ‘forest-kingdoms’ also occur in the Bṛhat-
Saṃhitā.^84 But these countries lay in the north-east division
of India, as mapped out by Varāhamihira, and they are, at
any rate, not the countries referred here.^85
In the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata, in one line of
Sahadeva's digvijaya, Professor Franklin Edgerton changes
Āṭavī to Antākhi, so that the line will refer to Antioch, Rome
and the Greeks. Antioch, Rome and Greece were intimately
associated in history and consequently they are still associated
in the minds of Western scholars, and hence Antākhi made
more sense to Edgerton in connection with Rome and the
Greeks than Āṭavī. But it only represents his personal opi-
nion.^86

दैवपुत्र
4. Daivaputra^87 (No. 1, L. 23):
Daivaputras along with Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and
Muruṇḍas are mentioned to have paid homage to Samudra-
gupta by rendering to him all kinds of service.
The word ‘Daivaputra’ denotes those ‘who belong to
devaputra’, i. e., Kaniṣka, i. e., the Kuṣāṇa ruler. The title
devaputra has frequently been used as a title by the Kuṣāṇa
kings.^88
The common belief is that the designation devaputra ‘god-
son’ was copied by the Kuṣāṇas from the ancient Chinese
imperial title, ‘T’ien-tzu’, ‘son of heaven’.^89 Thomas considers
that this title used by the Kuṣāṇas must have been borrowed
from the Hsiung-nu (a Central Asian Tribe) and not directly
from the Chinese.^90 Narain also believes the title to have been
borrowed by the Kuṣāṇas from Central Asia.^91 The title has
been frequently used by the kings in the Kharoṣṭhī documents
discovered from Chinese Turkestan.^92 As regards the origin of
the title, the divinity of the kings has been stressed upon in
many ancient empires.^93 The ancient Indian concept for ‘Deva-
putra’^94 meaning ‘god-son’ is slightly different. It was not used
for worldly kings but specifically for a class of distinguished
divinities, which in Indian Buddhist texts was specifically used
for four regional ‘great kings’, i. e., regents of four quarters,
East, West, North and South who were ‘sons of heaven’. In
the later Kuṣāṇa times, the term seems to have denoted the
sense of Royal insignia.^95 In a Buddhist text of this period the
question is raised ‘why kings are called devaputra’ and the
answer is that before being born as a man, he was abiding
among the gods (devas) and that, because the thirty-three gods
(each) contributed to his substance, therefore, he is ‘god-son’.^96
That Daivaputra denotes the Kuṣāṇas is obvious, since, no
other Indian king is known to have been styled ‘devaputra’.
Though Indian kings were usually addressed as ‘Deva’, we do
not find any evidence of an Indian king referring to himself as
deva. The Kuṣāṇas did not adopt devaputra as an official title
in early times. It is totally absent from their coins, its reading
on one coin of Kujula Kara Kaphsa being an error which
has been noticed by Thomas after re-examining the coin in
consultation with Allan.^97 Kaniṣka has not used the title even
in Peshawar Casket Inscriptions which were officially engraved.
It is only in documents inscribed by Indians that the title
‘devaputra’ is used for the Kuṣāṇa kings.^98 The title is used for
the first time for Kaniṣka (known as Candana Kaniṣka).^99
Mahārāja -rājātirāja devaputra Kuṣāṇa of the Taxila Silver
Scroll Inscription is generally taken to refer to Kaniṣka.^100
As rightly observed by Thomas “the devaputrasa of the scroll
inscription is the first known instance of the application to
the Kuṣāṇas of the designation devaputra, which regularly,
though not invariably, recurs with Kaniṣka and his succes-
sors.”^101
Thus we do not find the title Devaputra being used by
the Kuṣāṇa rulers themselves but was applied to them by the
Indians. Why of all ruling dynasties only the Kuṣāṇas were
designated as ‘Devaputras’ is really inexplicable. Thomas
suggests two possibilities. It may be due to the fact that the
Indians saw some similarity between the figures of the grand
Yakṣa and those of the burly Kusāṇa kings and the superior
title of ‘Devaputra’ may have appeared to be a suitable appel-
lation. Another possibility is that they found some similarity
between the Kuṣāṇa kings and Kubera (described in India as
regent of the north and god of wealth and known as Devaputra
in ancient Indian concept of Devaputra which simply means
god-son), especially in view of the lavish gold coinage of the
Kuṣāṇas. Aśvaghoṣa refers to the ‘great king Kanika’ as
‘guardian of the northern heaven’.^102 It is also likely that
the title devaputra may have been given due to Śiva-maheśvara,
whom we have seen styled as Devaputra and who is the sole
deity figured on the coins of Wima Kadphises.^103 These facts
need further investigation.
Most probably from the Epic Period, Indian concept of
Devaputra ‘god-son’ is linked with kings to give them divinity
and not as a title.^104 Aśoka could claim the title only of
‘Devānām priya’^105 meaning ‘the beloved of the gods’. Thus
Devaputra or ‘god-son’ was a superior title given to the Kuṣāṇas
by Indians. It is interesting to note that the epithet Devaputravat
has been used for Buddha in one of our inscriptions^106

हूण
5. Hūṇa (No. 13, L. 15):
They are mentioned in the Bhītarī Stone Pillar Inscription
of Skandagupta in which Skandagupta (A.D. 455 — 467) is
stated to have inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Hūṇas: “By
whose (Skandagupta's) two arms the earth was shaken, when
he, the creator (of a disturbance like that) of a terrible whirl-
pool, joined in close conflict with the Hūṇas...”.^107 The defeat
inflated upon the Hūṇas proved so decisive that for nearly
half a century the Gupta empire was immune from their
depredations.^108
Hūṇas, also known as Ephthalites or Hiung-nu were a
Central Asian tribe.
Uigur^109 transcribes the name of the tribe in ancient
Chinese in two phonetic forms: one of which is ‘xūnu or xunu’,
the other ‘xunux, xunuo, xunu’. The first part (xun — ) of the last
form is not in doubt and neither is the u of the last part, the
only question is about the change of the initial i of ancient
Chinese into y in Uigur before u and in Sandhi, and about
the pronunciation of the final consonant.^110
The first of the above Chinese forms which comes as close
to the Hunu as to the Sanskrit Hūṇa is very similar to the
Chinese “transcription” Xunu or Xūnu, and Avesta Hunu,
except the Sanskrit has substituted for the final root vowel ‘u’
the stem final — a characteristic of the names of peoples in that
language. “The Purāṇas have a form Urṇa which together with
Epic Skr. Hūṇa suggests Indic Hūrṇa Turk, Xūrnu”.^111
We may note here the Tibetan Hor, which corresponds
with the first syllable of the reconstructed form Hūr-ṇa. The
difference of vowels may indicate a back diphthong or back
vowel between o and u, as Ptolemy's Xoūnoi suggests, since
the Greeks wrote u (y) for Indic u.^112
Though all the above forms go back to one primitive form,
we cannot say the same for the people to whom they were
applied. The general opinion is that the Hsiung-nus, Huns,
Hūṇas etc., were Turks. Some scholars consider them to have
been a mixture of many tribes, Iranians, Mongols, and Paleosi-
birians (ancestors of the Yenissei-ostyaks). Whatever may have
been the dominant race or speech was, it can be seen that
there must have been several subject people and subject armies
in such far-flung empires, necessitating some mixture and
mutual influence — ethnic, linguistic and cultural.^113 Otto
Maenchen-Helfen has discussed the whole question on the
basis of the evidence of language, history, ethnology,
and archaeology^114 and has pointed out that the greater part
of the Hsiung-nu vocabulary pointed to Mongol^115 Later
Pelliot considered the same vocabulary and established that the
Hsiung-nu and Huns were Turks.^116
Louis Bazin^117 and Von Gabain^118 also reached the conclu-
sion that in language of the Hsiung-nu there was a high percent-
age of Turkish words.^119
In the second century B.C. the Hiung-nu (Huns) started a
movement near the Chinese frontier and succeeded in destroying
the Greco-Bactrian empire, in strongly menacing the existence
of the house of Arsakes, and in landing crowds of Central
Asian invaders within the borders of India. In the latter half
of the fourth century A.D., a branch of them, the White Huns,
or Ephthalites, flooded the South of Asia; and ‘about the time
when the last legions of Rome shattered on the plains of
Chalons, the motley hordes of Attila, the White Huns had
begun to tread Sassanian Persia under the hoofs of their
horses, and were soon to smash the Indian empire of the
Guptas into pieces’.^120
In A.D. 484 the Hūṇas killed the Sassanian ruler of Persia.
Towards the close of the fifth century A.D. they ruled over a
vast empire with their principal capital at Balkh.^121 We know
of a Hūṇa-deśa placed to the South of the Kāma-giri and to
the North of Maru-deśa, i. e., the desert called the land of
heroes. The Harṣacarita places the Hūṇa country in the Punjab
region practically suggesting the same area.^122
In the middle of the sixth century A.D., the Sassanian king
of Persia made an alliance with Western Turks against the
Hūṇas and smashed their rule from the Oxus by killing their
king sometime between A.D. 563 and 567.^123
We know of Toramāṇa from his Eraṇ Boar Inscription^124
and of Mihirakula from his Gwalior Inscription.^125 These
two are generally taken to have been Hūṇa chiefs. There is
another inscription found at Kura (Salt range in the Punjab)
referring to Rājādhirāja Mahārāja Toramāṇa-Ṣāhi-Jau (bla),
whom some scholars identify with king Toramāṇa mentioned
in the Eraṇ Inscription,^126 but others regard the two as quite
different.^127 Here it must be pointed out, none of these inscrip-
tions describes any of these kings as Hūṇas nor contains any
reference to the Hūṇas.
We find an interesting account of Toramāṇa in the Jain
work, Kuvalayamālā, composed to 700 Śaka (A.D. 778).^128 Here
Toramāṇa is stated to have lived on the bank of the Candrab-
hāgā (Chenab river). His guru Hari-gupta, who himself was a
scion of the Gupta family, also lived there.^129
Both Toramāṇa and Mihirakula are referred to in the Rāja-
taraṅgiṇī, but there is no mention of their being the Hūṇas.
It is doubtful whether Toramāṇa and Mihirakula were Hūṇas
or Kuṣāṇas. Sir Aurel Stein, Jayaswal^130 and Fleet^131 held that
Toramāṇa was a Kuṣāṇa. But Sten Konow^132 holds that Tora-
māṇa was, in all probability, a Hūṇa, as is generally assumed,
and not a Kuṣāṇa. It is not unlikely that the Hūṇas and the
Kuṣāṇas were ethnically allied and were later merged into a
new nation, which came to be known as Hūṇa in India.^133
There are several stray references to the Hūṇas in Indian
literature. D.C. Sircar^134 opines that the Indian names Hūṇa,
Hārahūṇa or Hārahūra, supposed to be associated with the
Chinese name Hiung-nu and ‘the White Hun’ of the European
writers, are mentioned in a few late passages of the Mahābhārata
and in the geographical sections of the early Purāṇas, can be
roughly assigned to the 4th century A.D. A sūtra-vṛtti in the
Candra Vyākaraṇa has the sentence ‘ajayad-gupta (or Japto or
Jarto) Hūṇān’ as an illustration of the use of the imperfect to
express an event which occurred within the life-time of the
author.^135
In the Mandasor inscription of Yaśodharman^136 a reference
is made to the chiefs of the Hūṇas, but they are not named.
The inscription simply says that Yaśodharman possessed coun-
tries which not even the Guptas and the chiefs of the Hūṇas
could subdue.^137
The inscription also refers to Mihirakula “who had earlier
bowed only to the god Sthāṇu (Śiva) and whose forehead was
pained through being bent low down by the strength of the arm
of Yaśodharman in the act of compelling obeisance”.^138
With the fall of Yaśodharman, which probably took place
not long after, Mihirakula again came to the forefront. In the
early part of the sixth century A.D. Śākala become his capital.^139
The Gupta king who then occupied the imperial throne was
probably Narasiṃha-Gupta Bālāditya. He was temporarily over-
whelmed by the victorious raids of Yaśodharman, and Mihirak-
ula evidently took advantage of this imperial crisis to extend
his power. Narasiṃhagupta, according to Hiuen Tsang, was
forced to the humiliating position of paying tribute to Mihira-
kula but finally triumphed over his rival.^140
The defeat of Mihirakula appears to have finally crushed
the political supremacy of the Hūṇas in India who ceased to
be even a disturbing element in Indian History.^141 The Purāṇas
place the Hūṇas in the extreme west, with the Sauvīras,
Saindhavas, Śākalas and Madras.^142
In the Raghuvaṃśa, Kālidāsa mentions Raghu defeating
the Hūṇas on the banks of the Vaṅkṣu or the Oxus^143, the (pale)
faces of whose wives spoke of the bravery of their husbands
(who died in the battle).^144
Varāhamihira^145 mentions them under the jurisdiction of
Ketu and places them in the North.^146 Dr. Upendra Thakur^147
remarks that about the sixth century A.D., the Hūṇas almost
lost their original name of Hiong-nou or Huns. Later the powerful
Turks give its name to the entire Hūṇa nation by which they
were further known in the neighbouring nations. Afterwards
they were submerged in the Mongols under the influence of the
powerful Mongol Chief Chengiz Khan. Thus, the Hiong-nou or
Huns received different names in different periods beginning
with their origin to their advancement in other countries. In
spite of the copious references to the Ephthalites in the accounts
of the different countries, it is very difficult to determine their
exact origin and ethnic affinities.
We can partly agree with Dr. Thakur as regards their
merger in the area later dominated by the Turks and Mongols
but the Hūṇas find their mention in the Harṣa-Carita of Bāṇa
(a seventh century work) and they remained a potent force in
the social and political life of the Punjab-Rajasthan-Malwa-
Gujarat region during the early medieval period as evidenced
by a large number of epigraphical and literary records, and
also proved themselves as a source of danger to the Pāla kings
of Bengal^148

to a country named Kharapatha, watered by the river Nalinī.
It is difficult to say whether Khara-sāgara-rāśī and Kharapatha
had anything to do with the Kharaparikas.^160 K.P. Jayaswal
expresses the probability of the identification of the Kharapa-
rikas with the five Karpaṭas of the Mahābhārata.^161

कोतस्
8. Kotas (No. 1, L. 14):
The Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta mentions
Samudragupta's capturing a king born in the family of the
Kotas.^162 Mookerji equates the Kota-kulaja of the inscription
with king Kalyāṇavarman of the play ‘Kaumudī-Mahotsava’.^163
But it is now generally believed^164 that ‘the episode of the
Kaumudī-Mahotsava has no bearing whatsoever on the early
Gupta History’.
The coins of the Kotas bearing their name have been found
in East Punjab, and Delhi, and ‘they probably ruled in the
Upper Gangetic valley’.^165 Scholars differ in their views
about placing the Kotas; some identify it with Kanyakubja
while others with Pāṭaliputra.^166
It is known that Puṣpapura or Kusumapura was the name of
both the Pāṭaliputra and Kānyakubja.^167 It must, however, be
noted that the city of Puṣpa here is connected mainly with
Samudragupta and not with the Kota-kulaja,^168 so the location
of the city of the Kotas is not to be traced in Kusumapura or
Puṣpapura. It is well known that Candragupta I received
Magadha through his Licchavi-alliance and it is possible that
Samudragupta enjoyed his youth playfully at Pāṭaliputra
(Puṣpa-āhvaye krīḍatā). So Goyal's assumption that ‘Hariṣeṇa
has referred to Kānyakubja and not Pāṭaliputra’^169 is incorrect.
It is only later that Kānyakubja gains the honour of being
called Kusumapura when the glory of Pāṭaliputra had started
declining.^170
In view of the context of the victory over Kota-kulaja
along with the Nāga kings Acyuta and Nāgasena and with the
support of numismatic evidence it may be said that the kotas
lived somewhere between East Punjab and Delhi.

कुरुस्
9. Kurus (No. 22, L. 7):
The Kurus were divided into two branches, the Northern and
the Southern.^171 We have here a reference to the Uttarakurus.^172
The Kurus were one of the most ancient and prominent of
the Indo-Āryan kṣatriya tribes.^173 In the earliest literature the
Kurus do not appear under that name as a people. But
mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa (Glory of the
Kurus)^174 and of a Pākasthāman Kauravyāyaṇa.^175 The Athar-
vaveda^176 refers to Parīkṣita as a king of the Kurus and his
son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa^177
as one of the great performers of the horse sacrifice.
Oldenberg^178 seems to be right in suggesting that the
Kuru people, as known later, included some of the tribes
referred to by other names in the Ṛgveda. Kuruśravaṇa,
shown by his name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the
Ṛgveda called Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’
who is well known as a king of the Purus. Moreover, it is
likely that the Tṛtsu-Bharatas, who appear in the Ṛgveda as
enemies of the Purus, later coalesced with them to form the
Kuru people.^179 Moreover, there is evidence that the Bharatas
occupied the territory in which the Kurus were later found.
Two of them are spoken of in a hymn of the Ṛgveda^180 as
having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the Āpayā, and the
Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places of the later
Kurukshetra.^181
In the Brāhmaṇa literature, the Kurus are often con-
nected with Pāñcālas.^182
The territory of the Kuru-Pāñcālas is declared in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).^183
A group of the Kuru people still remained further north — the
Uttara Kurus beyond the Himalayas.^184 It appears from a
passage of the Śātapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the
Northerners-that is, presumably the Northern Kurus-and of the
Kuru — Pāñcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.^185
There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical Culture was
developed in the country of the Kuru-Pāñcālas, and that it
spread thence east, south and west. ^186
The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part in the Epic
and later literature, are still a historical people in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa.^187 where they are located beyond the Himalayas
(pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,^188 however, the
country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vasiṣṭha Sāthavya
to be a land of the gods (deva-kṣetra), but Jānṃtapi
Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly
mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view that the
northern Kurus were settled in Kashmir, especially as Kuruk-
shetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kashmir
might naturally be found.^189 In Buddhist literature, Uttara-
Kuru is very often mentioned as a mythic region, but there are
some passages which go to show that there was a faint memory
of a country that once had a historical existence.^190
Some time before the fourth century B.C., the monarchical
constitution of the Kurus gave place to a republic, for we are
told by Kauṭilya^191 that the Kurus were ‘rāja-śabdopajīvinaḥ’,
or ‘enjoying the status of rājan’ — i. e. all citizens had equal rank
and rights.^192
Shafer^193 shows that only the upper castes of the Kauravas
were Āryan, the bulk of the population were probably non-
Āryan as is clear from the fact that whereas the Kauravas
rallied the support mostly of the non-Āryans, the Pāṇḍavas
had the support of Āryans and concludes that the Northern
Kurus were Muṇḍic.^194

10. Licchavis (No. 1, L. 29; No. 4, L. 7; No. 10, L. 4; No. 12,
L. 18; No. 13, L. 3: No. 21, L. 5; No. 40, L. 4; No. 47,
L. 2; No. 49, L. 2; No. 50, L. 2; No. 53, L. 2):
The epithet ‘Licchavi-dauhitra’ (daughter's son of the Licchavi)
for Samudragupta occurs in all these Gupta records It
suggests the importance of Candragupta I's marriage with the
Licchavi princess Kumāradevī. The alliance had no social
importance but it was important for political gain by virtue
of which Candragupta I (Samudragupta's father) gained power-
ful position in Magadha and the neighbouring countries. In
the Candragupta-Kumāradevī-coins, we have no mention of
the Guptas but only of the Licchavis in plural ‘Licchavayaḥ’
(the Licchavis). This supports the amalgamation of the
Guptas with the Licchavis and we may agree with Majumdar
that ‘the epithet Licchavi dauhitra was deliberately given to
Samudragupta to emphasize his right of succession to the dual
monarchy’.^195
We also know of a house of the Licchavis at Nepal^196 but
the separate reference to Nepal as a tributary province in the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta^197 proves that it
was different from the Licchavi kingdom which Samudragupta
had inherited from his mother. The Licchavi kingdom of
Kumāradevī may be located in North Bihar with Vaiśālī
(modern Basarh in Muzaffarpur district) as its centre.^198 It was
a credit for the astute diplomacy of Candragupta to marry the
Licchavi princess as we know, in ancient times, the Licchavis of
Vaiśālī had been the rivals of the kings of Pāṭaliputra^199 and
that they did not marry outside their area.^200
The name of this powerful people has come to us in many
different readings:
Licchavi, Lecchavi, Lecchai, Lecchaki, Licchvi, Nicchivi,
Lichikki and Lichavi.
Of these the Licchavi has been most commonly used in
literature.^201
The earliest mention of this people is in Kauṭilya's Artha-
śāstra,^202 where they are called Licchavis. Here we read that
the corporations of Licchivi, Vṛji, Malla, Madra, Kakura,
Kuru, Pañcāla and others were ‘rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ’. It is note-
worthy that Kauṭilya distinguishes the Licchavis from the Vṛjis
though some scholars consider them to be one.^203 H. Pandey^204
says that it appears from the Pali suttas that the names Vajji
and Licchavi are interchangeable to some extent. But the
accounts of Chinese pilgrims point to a different conclusion.
Fa-Hien describes the kingdom of Vaiśālī where ‘Licchavis’
were the people of the country. He does not mention Vṛji or
Vajji. Hiuen Tsang describes Vaiśālī and Vṛji as two distinct
countries, and Watters is inclined to doubt the accuracy of his
description of the Vṛji country.^205 But we know that Vajji was
a powerful confederacy of which the Videhas along with the
Licchavis, Jñātrikas, Ugras, Bhojas and others were the cons-
tituent confederate clans (aṭṭhakula). Of these the Licchavis and
the Videhas were the most important, and the Licchavi Capital
Vaiśālī was the head-quarter of the confederacy.^206 But Ray
Chaudhuri observes: “Vajji was not only the name of the
confederacy but also of one of the constituent clans. But the
Vajjis like the Licchavis are sometimes associated with the
city of Vaiśālī which was not only the capital of the Licchavi
clan, but also the metropolis of the entire confederacy”.^207 The
Licchavi republic was generally called the saṃgha or gaṇa of
the Vajjis. The Licchavis would not possibly have allowed this
name, had they not themselves been Vajjians. In one passage,
the Licchavi Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis
who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is
represented as saying, “They (i. e. the Licchavis) will become
Vajjians, they will become Vajjians (bhavissanti Vajji bhavis-
santi Vajji)”! This possibly only means that there was great
hope of these Licchavi young men becoming true Vajjians,
practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the
Buddha, conditions which endured their prosperity, and lead-
ing a more cultured life. Thus the Vajji appears to be a more
dignified term. It might have originally been given to the tribe
which inhabited what is known as Vajjiraṭṭha (Vṛji-rāṣṭra), i. e.,
the Vajjian country, in Buddhist literature. Later a separation
seems to have taken place among the Vajjis and Licchavis,
because the Arthaśāstra (XI. I) mentions the Licchavika and
the Vṛjika as two distinct republics.^208
The clan of the Licchavis figures very prominently in the
annals of early Buddhism. Buddhaghoṣa, the celebrated Pali
commentator has the following story^209: The chief queen of
the king of Benaras, at the time of her child-birth delivered
lump of flesh, ‘of the colour of lac and of bandhu and Jīvaka
flowers’. Fearing the displeasure of the king if he should hear
of this, the other queens put the lump of flesh into a casket
marked with royal seal and placed it on the flowing waters of
the Ganges. The casket was discovered by an ascetic, and
taken by him to his hermitage, where he cared for the lump of
flesh. After the lapse of some time, tha lump broke up into
two pieces of flesh, which gradually assumed shape, till finally
one of them became a boy resplendent like gold, and the other a
girl. Whatever entered the stomach of these two infants looked
as if put into a vessel of precious transparent stone (maṇi)
so that they seemed to have no skin (Nicchavi). Others said: ‘the
two were attached to each other by their skin (līna-chavi) as if
they had been sewn together’; so that these infants came to be
designated ‘Licchavis’. We are further told that on coming of
age the boy and the girl were married to each other and from
this brother and sister union sprang the race of the Licchavis^210
The origin of the Licchavis has been a matter of great
controversy. They have been represented as Scythians, Kolari-
ans, Tibetans and Persians by different authorities.^211
Samuel Beal^212 takes the Licchavis or Vajjis to be a
branch of the ‘Yue-Chi’ forgetting that the latter came to India
in the first century B.C. while the Licchavis were a highly
civilized and prosperous people in the sixth century B.C.
In the opinion of J.P. Hewitt, there are “very strong
indications that the Vajjians, who were certainly the earliest
settlers in the country, were of Kolarian race who had lived
there long before the arrival of the Dravidians and Āryans”.
The learned writer ignores the existence of the pre-Vajjian
Āryan dynasty of rulers at Vaiśālī.^213
V.A. Smith^214 found similarities between the customs of
the Tibetans and those of the Licchavis in the practice of the
exposure of the dead and also in judicial procedure. And
hence he came to the conclusion that the Licchavis, the
ruling tribe or clan in Vṛji country of which Vaiśālī was the
capital, was really a Tibetan (or Mongolian) tribe which settled
in the plains during the prehistoric times. The view has been
criticised by B.C. Law, K.P. Jayaswal, H.C. Raychaudhuri
and others on the following grounds^215:
(1) The custom of the disposal of the dead was prevalent
among the Vedic Āryans from whom the Licchavis
were descended;
(2) In the case of Tibet we have only three courts as
against the seven tribunals of the Licchavis; further
we know very little about the relative antiquity of the
Tibetan procedure which might very well have been
suggested by the system expounded in the Aṭṭhakathā.
S.C. Vidyābhūṣaṇa^216 suggests a Persian origin for the
Licchavis holding that the name Licchavi (Nicchavi of Manu,
X. 22) was derived from the Persian city of Nisibis. There
is very little in Vidyābhūṣaṇa's surmise except a fancied
resemblance between the names Nicchivi and Nisibis. Inscrip-
tions of the Achaemenids are silent about any Persian settle-
ment in the Eastern India in the sixth or fifth century B.C. The
Licchavi people were more interested in Yakṣa caityas and the
teaching of Mahāvīra and the Buddha than in the deities and
Prophets of Iran.^217
The Licchavis have been invariably represented as kṣatriyas
in ancient Indian literature. As the Mahāparinibbāṇa-Sutta
informs us, they claimed a share of the remnants of the
Buddha's body on the ground that they were kṣatriyas like the
Buddha himself: “The Exalted one was a kṣatriya and so are
we. We are worthy to receive a portion of relies of the Exalted
one”. We get many other similar instances.^218 We find that
both the Śākyas (to whose race the Buddha belonged) and the
Licchavis are described as progenies of brother and sister
unions. Like the Śākyas, the Licchavis are also described as
kṣatriyas.^219 Manu speaks of the Licchavis as kṣatriyas, though
of the Vrātya variety.^220 Regarding the Vrātyas, Manu says:
‘Those (sons) whom the twice-born have by the wives of equal
caste, but who, not fulfilling their scared duties, are excluded
from the initiation to Sāvitrī, one must designate by the appel-
lation vrātyas’.^221
We know that Mahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, was the
very kin of the Licchavis and that he had many followers
among the residents of Vaiśālī, even among the highest officers.
Then again, between the sixth century B.C. and 200 B.C., the
earliest estimated date of the Manusmṛti,^222 the Licchavis had
won the good graces of the Buddha as well as of the followers
of the religion he preached. During this long interval, when the
two great ‘heretic’ faiths flourished in their country, the
Licchavis might not have been particular to the ceremonies and
practices that the regulations of the orthodox brāhmaṇas
required. ‘Hence we can understand how Manu, the great
brāhmaṇa law-giver came to refer to the Licchavis as
Vrātyas’.^223 But Gokhale^224 takes the term kṣatriya in this
context to mean representative of political power rather than
a specific caste in the brahminical hierarchy and from the word
Vrātya infers that they were outside the pale of the brahminical
civilization.
Scholars have divergent views about the connotation of the
word ‘Vrātya’.^225 Charpentier described the Vrātyas, as a band
of people not governed by the rules of caste, probably repre-
senting the worst elements of Indian society, — the thief, the
robber, the drunken one, etc. But Keith rejected this view by
pointing out that Manu's reference to the Rājanya Vrātyas,
e. g. Licchavis and Mallas (X. 22) has no value for Vedic
times.^226 Haver in his article ‘Der Vrātya’ derives ‘Vrātya’
from ‘vrata’. Thus the oldest meaning of ‘Vrāta’ is a group of
people bound by holy ceremonies, bound by a vow to cult-
actions being derived from ‘vrata’ which is a vow taken in the
service of a god. The Vrātīnas, on the other hand, ‘were
Aryans of a more primitive culture and religion, than the
orthodox brāhmaṇas, and were organised in cult-unions and
both ‘vrātya’ and ‘vrātīna’ being derived from ‘vrata’ are
‘members of the same holy union’. The only difference between
them apparently was that the Vrātīna went to the brāhmaṇa
countries to perform the Vrātya-work and were paid for it,
while the Vrātyas acted in their own homeland.^227
From all these considerations, we can see that the views of
Manu and the suggestion of B.C. Law are more tenable. In
the Nepāla Vaṃśāvalī, the Licchavis are allotted to the Sūrya-
vaṃśa or solar race of the kṣatriyas.^228 This is quite in agree-
ment with the fact elicited from the Buddhist records that they
were Vāsiṣṭhas by Gotra, for we know from the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa^229 that the gotra or pravara (family) of a kṣatriya is
the same as that of his purohita or family-priest. The Vasiṣṭha
gotra was, therefore, the gotra of their family priest, and we
know that the Vasiṣṭhas were the family priests of the kings of
the solar race, especially of the Ikṣvākus.^230

11. Madrakas (No. I, L. 22):
One of the tribes subjugated by Samudragupta. We also know
of Madra as a personal name in No. 15, L. 8.
Madras claimed descent from an eponymous king Madraka,
son of Śibi Auśīnara, and were septs of the family of Śivi
like the Kaikeyas.^231
According to Dr. Buddha Prakash ‘Bhadra’ was another
Variant of Madra.^232 But this view is not acceptable to us.
The Mahābhārata^233 mentions the Bhadras, but only in the
Bombay recension; the Calcutta recension has Madra.^234 We
know that Bhadra and Madra had independent existence, as
found in the legend of Bhadrā Kākṣīvatī, bride of Vyuṣi-
tāśva.^235 The queen had seven children, three Śālvas and
four Madras. ^236
The Candravṛtti on Candra^237 informs us that Udumbara,
Tilakhala, Madrakāra, Yugandhara, Bhuliṅga and Śaradaṇḍa,
are the divisions of Sālva (or Śālva). The word Śālva literally
means an animal like stag or gazelle which bespeaks of
Scythian origin.^238 Buddha Prakash connects it with the
modern sub-caste Saluja (Skt. Sālvaja). Anyhow, we know that
Madras were a branch of Śālvas who were sons of Bhadra.
J. Przyluski^239 considers the Madras to have been a section of
the Bhadras on the ground that the former had among their
ancestress a queen named Bhadrā. Both the Bhadras and the
Madrakas are mentioned separately in the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,^240 the
Bhadras with the Śālvas in the Madhyadeśa (Middle land)
and the Madrakas with the Mālavas in the northern quarter.
Nakula and Sahadeva were the sons of Pāṇḍu by his
wife Mādrī. The name of their mother Mādrī suggests their
connection with the clan of the Madras.^241 Since Bālhiki
(Bāhlika stands for the Bactrians) was the title of Mādrī,
Madras were of Irano-Bactrian origin; the Madras may rep-
resent the Iranian tribe, Māda or Mede.^242
The Madras were an ancient kṣatriya tribe.^243 We do not
find their mention in the early Vedic Saṃhitās but the Vaṃśa
Brāhmaṇa (of the Sāmaveda) tells us of a Vedic teacher named
Madra-gāra Śauṅgāyani (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) whose pupil
was Kāmboja Aupamanyava.^244 Zimmer^245 concludes, with pro-
bability, that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas
and the Madras. We know from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^246
that the Madra country was the chief centre of Vedic learning.
We know of a Kāpya Patañcala amongst the Madras who
was a famous teacher of Vedic lore.^247
The Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras’ are referred
to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^248 as living beyond the Himalaya
(pareṇa himavantam) in the neighbourhood of the Uttara
Kurus, probably, as Zimmer^249 conjectures, in the land of
Kashmira. The Madras mentioned in the Upaniṣads were, like
the Kurus, probably settled somewhere in Kurukshetra in the
Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land’.^250
Pāṇini^251 mentions two divisions of the Madras, Pūrva
(eastern) and Apara (Western). In the Bṛhatsaṃhitā they are
mentioned twice; firstly as Madra situated in West in Vāyavya
Koṇa,^252 and secondly as Madraka with Mālava in the
North.^253
In the Rāmāyaṇa, we read that Sugrīva sent monkeys to
the Madrakas and other tribes in quest of Sītā.^254 The Madra
tribe or kingdom^255 is mentioned in the Bhīṣmaparvan of the
Mahābhārata (chap. IX) and in Pāṇini's grammar (II, 3, 73;
IV, 4, 67). The Madras held the Central portions of the
Punjab;^256 they appear in the Epic period to have occupied
the district of Sialkot, between the rivers Chenab and Ravi,^257
or according to some between the Jhelum and the Ravi.^258
S.B. Chaudhuri^259 says that the Madras held the portion in
the Doab between the Chenab and the Ravi, possibly com-
prising even a portion of the country between the Jhelum and
the Chenab, and thus abutted on Kaikeya on the West.
We get a clue to the inhabitance of the Madras from a verse
in the Karṇaparvan of the Mahābhārata^260 which refers to a
Madra, who had come to live among the Kurus, as yearning
for his return to his native place beyond the Śatadru and the
Irāvatī to enjoy the company of charming women.
Śākala (Pali-Sagala, modern Sialkot) was the capital of the
Madras identified^261 with Sanglawala-Tiba, to the West of the
Ravi. From the Milinda-pañho, we learn that king Milinda
(Menander) a Graeco-Bactrian king, who became a convert to
Buddhism, was ruling over the Madda country with Sagala as
his capital which according to a Buddhist lexicon, was one of
the twenty ancient cities.^262 The brahminical name^263 of the
Madra Capital was Śākala mentioned by Pāṇini^264 as Sānkala.
In the Mahābhārata^265 and the Jātakas^266 Śākala is described
as standing on the bank of the Āpagā in a tongue of land
between two rivers, called the Śākaladvīpa, which corresponds
to the Rechna Doab.
We know from the Mahābhārata about Śalya, king of the
Madras (Madrarāja). ^267 After severe fighting, and many
vicissitudes, the Madra soldiers were killed by Arjuna.^268
The Madras are mentioned in the Purāṇas as well.^269 The
Viṣṇu Purāṇa^270 refers to the Madras along with the Ārāmas,
Pārasīkas, and others and in the Matsya Purāṇa^271 with
Gāndhāra, Yavana and others. The latter^272 mentions king
Aśvapati of Śākala in the kingdom of the Madras.
The Madras, according to the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya^273
were a corporation of warriors and people enjoyed the title of
rājan (rājaśabdopajīvinaḥ).^274
Madra women were noted for their beauty. ^275 The Jātakas
bear ample testimony to the fact that the Madra princesses
were sought in marriage by the great kṣatriya house of North
India.^276 The Mahābhārata tells us that it was a family custom
of the Madras to receive a fee from the bridegroom when they
gave their daughters in marriage.^277
Some scholars identify the Madras with Vāhlika (or
Vāhīka).^278 Śākala as a Vāhīkagrāma is also mentioned by
Patañjali.^279 From the references in the Mahābhārata, Vāhīka
would appear to have stood for the whole of Punjab.^280 The
Vāhīka-grāmas of Śākala and Pātanaprastha, as referred to
in the grammatical works,^281 imply the inclusion of Madra-
janapada in the Vāhīka country.
The Madras are known as low, barbarous^282 and sinful
people.^283 They are mentioned as base, impure and contemp-
tible.^284 “Amongst the Madrakas all acts of friendship are
lost”^285 and so it is said: “Neither one should create enmity, nor
friendship with a Madraka”.^286 The Rājataraṅgiṇī also records
similar views.^287
But the advent of the Jarttikas or Jartas (modern Jāṭs) who
spread over the whole of Punjab was responsible for the degene-
ration of the Madras.^288 The legend of Sāvitrī and Satyavan
is connected with the Madra country, for Sāvitrī was the
daughter of Aśvapati, king of Madra.^289 In the Udyogaparvan
the camp of Śalya is described as full of warriors, whose strange
armours, bows and banners, unfamiliar trappings, vehicles and
equipment and local costumes, ornaments and deportment
presented a unique spectacle in the country of the Kurus. ^290
In the early part of the sixth century A.D. the Madra
country passed under the rule of the Hūṇa conqueror Mihira-
kula (A.D. 515-535) who ruled from Sialkot. The Madras
continued to flourish even up to the time of the Pāla king
Dharmapāla in the 9th century A.D.^291

12. Mālava (No. 1, L. 22; No. 17, L. 19; No. 32, L. 11):
We know Mālava as a tribe which was subjugated along with
some other tribes by Samudragupta (No. 1). No. 17 refers to the
Mālava-gaṇa^292 which has been translated by Fleet as ‘the tribal
constitution of the Mālavas’ in the sense of the event of some
formal establishment of the Mālavas’ as a tribe.^293 Fleet fixes
it up as 57-56 B.C.^294 Thomas^295 translates the expression as
“the continuance (sthiti) of the tribal constitution (gaṇa) of
the Mālavas” and adds “It was to gaṇa-sthiti, not to gaṇa, that
I gave the meaning of ‘tribal constitution’; and I did not intro-
duce the idea of ‘Continuance’.” My amended translation is
“the usage of the Mālava tribe.”^296 Thus the expression ‘Māla-
vānām gaṇa’ refers to the Mālavas as a tribe. No. 32 speaks of
the Mālava-vaṃśa which has been translated as ‘the race of
the Mālavas,^297 but it would be better to translate it as “the
dynasty of the Mālavas”.^298 It seems that this tribe had esta-
blished independent rulership and so we find the word ‘vaṃśa’
used where the word ‘gaṇa’ could also be used^299
Dr. Buddha Prakash holds that Madras and Mālavas were
the same, in Prakrit Madra becomes Malla, as ‘dra’ is changed
into ‘ll’. He identifies Malla with the Malloi of the Greeks
and Mālava of the Epic. He points out that the sons of Aśva-
pati, king of the Madras, were called Mālavas after their
mother, according to decree of Yama which shows that Madra
and Mālava were identical.^300
But we venture to disagree with the learned scholar. The
Bṛhatsaṃhitā mentions Madraka and Mālava separately but
side by side as people of the North.^301
At the time of Samudragupta, the Mālavas possibly lived in
Rajasthan and West Malwa^302 consisting of Mewar, Tonk and
adjoining regions of south-east Rajasthan.^303 They settled in
various localities in Western India after having migrated from
the Punjab where they had fought with Alexander on the lower
banks of Ravi.^304 Their original home was in Jhang District,
Punjab. ^305 Subsequently they became the inhabitants of Malwa
and the Vikrama era derived its original appellation from
them.^306 That the Mālavas had migrated to the Jaipur region
(Rajasthan) from the Punjab is supported by the fact that the
legend on some Mālava coins found in Rajasthan reads from
right to left as in Kharoṣṭhī, which was prevalent in the
Punjab and the north-west from very early times.^307 The Sikhs
of Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Patiala, Jind and Malerkotala are
still known as Mālava Sikhs, probably, because these regions
were populated by the Mālavas in ancient times.^308 Mālava
and Mālavaka are also to be differentiated, the former is
Mālava proper while the latter is lesser Mālava with the diminu-
tive suffix ‘ka’.^309
Mālava is the same as Malloi of the Greeks.^310 Pāṇini does
not mention them by name, but his sūtra, V. 3. 117 speaks of
‘āyudhajīvī saṃghas’, or tribes living by the profession of arms,
and the Kāśikā says that amongst these saṃghas were the
Mālavas and Kṣudrakas.^311 The Mālava tribe is actually men-
tioned in the Mahābhaṣya of Patañjali.^312
The Mahābhārata couples the Mālavas with the Tri-
garttas,^313 as well as with the Śivis and Ambaṣṭhas.^314 But
soon they migrated southwards and settled somewhere in Rajas-
than where we find them at the time of Samudragupta.^315
Many coins found at Nagar, 45 miles north of Kota, have the
legend. “Mālavānām jayaḥ” (victory of the Mālavas) in letters
belonging to the period from 250 B.C. to A.D. 250. According
to Cunningham these coins show that the existence of the
Mālavas as a recognised and important clan, long before their
tribal constitution led to the establishment of their era.^316 The
Mālavas came into conflict with Nahapāna's son-in-law Uṣava-
dāta who subdued them.^317
According to the Purāṇas^318 the Mālavas are associated with
the Saurāṣṭras, Avantis, Ābhīras, Śūras, and Arbudas, dwell
along the Pariyātra mountains. Thus they seem to have occupi-
ed other territories besides the Punjab or Rajasthan. Pargiter
points out that even according to the Purāṇas the Mālavas
lived in a ‘mountanious’ country, and were nowhere near pre-
sent Malwa. Mālava king were taken as vrātya and mostly
śūdra in the Purāṇas.^319
The Bhīṣmaparvan of the Mahābhārata mentions the western
(pratīcya) and northern (udīcya) sections of the Mālavas.^320
But the Rāmāyaṇa locates the Mālavas in the east. ^321 Kāma-
sūtra's commentator Jayamaṅgala, who flourished later than
the fourteenth century, says that Āvantika, which is identical
with Ujjayinī-deśa, is apara-Mālava.^322 This has led some
writers to suggest that Mālava proper is Daśārṇa. But Jaya-
maṅgala's geographical knowledge was not perfect.^323 His
remark on Mālava is to be rejected as it runs counter to earlier
authorities. Rājaśekhara mentions Mālava, Avanti and Vidiśā
and the Mañjūśrī mentions Mālava, Vidiśā and Daśārṇa side
by side^324 Modern Malwa is the region around Ujjayinī and
Bhilsa. The influence of the Mālavas in the Mandasor region is
proved by the fact that they could impose their tribal era upon
the Mandasor princes.^325 An inscription describes the subjuga-
tion of Sapta-Mālava by Daṇḍanāyaka Anantapāla, a feudatory
of Vikramāditya VI.^326
The Harṣacarita of Bāṇa refers to the ‘wicked Mālava king’
generally identified with Devagupta, who killed Grahavarman
Maukhari, but was himself defeated by Rājyavardhana.
B.C. Law places the kingdom of Devagupta between Prayāga
and Bhilsa which is identical with Pūrva-Mālava.^327
Thus the Mālavas originally belonged to Jhang District
in Punjab (now in Pakistan), from where they spread all
over Punjab and by the time of Samudragupta had migrated
to Rajasthan. The Mālavas had emerged in 250 B.C. as an
independent tribal state. But they came under the subservience
of the Śakas in the Ist century B.C., to the western kṣatraps
from the 2nd to the 4th centuries A.D. and to Samudragupta
in the 4th century A.D., but this typical native state exerted
itself again.^328 In the period after about A.D. 550 they seem to
have migrated further to the east and covered the region from
Bhilsa (Eastern Malwa) to Prayāga.^329 During the rule of the
Pālas of Bengal they seem to have migrated still further east;
for the copper plates of the Pāla kings (excepting Dharmapāla),
refer to the Mālavas as mercenary troops in their army.^330
The name of the tribe survives in the modern province of
Malwa (a transformation of the word Mālava), and in the brāh-
maṇa castes called ‘Mālavīs’ or ‘Mālavikas’. They are the brāh-
maṇas of Mālava proper and the adjoining country, but are found
also in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.^331

म्लेच्छ
13. Mleccha (No. 14, L. 4):
According to Sircar^332 Fleet conjectures the reading to be
Mleccha. The last few letters in line 4 after ‘ni’ are not legible.
So how Fleet could take this reading without putting any
doubt is really surprising. Mlecchas were amongst the enemies
defeated by Skandagupta in this inscription (No. 14). The war
with the Mlecchas probably refers to his fight with the Hūṇas
which is specifically referred to in the Bhitari Pillar Inscription.
Whether the Mlecchas are the same as Hūṇas or were a
different tribe, both the records (No. 13, No. 14) claim that
Skandagupta completely defeated these enemies.^333 The fact
that in both the inscriptions, the reference to the fight with the
Hūṇas and Mlecchas is preceded by a reference to the falling
fortunes of the family supports the identification.
We also find a reference to the oppression of the earth by
the Mlecchas in the epilogue of the play Mudrā-Rākṣasa written
by Viṣākhadatta where it is prayed that ‘The earth may now be
protected by “His Highness” along with relatives and retinue
by king Candragupta’. It is probable that the play was written
after the Rāmagupta episode and probably the word Mleccha
in this context alludes to the Śakas who were suppressed by
Candragupta II in the guise of the Gupta queen Dhruvasvāminī.
D.C. Sircar^334 is of the view that Mleccha is the name
applied to the Muhammadans and other foreigners. In the
Sanskrit language originally there does not appear to have
been any general term for a foreigner. But as the Dāsa, Dasyu,
Barbara, and Mleccha became more or less absorbed in Āryan
civilization and the original specific meaning of these terms
was no longer remembered, these words came to be used for
any foreigner.^335
The word Mleccha was used to refer to both the eastern and
western Ānavas. In course of time it came to be used for almost
any non-Āryan and even for Āryans of impure speech. Subse-
quently the term meant something like “foreigner”, but that was
after most of the Ānavas had become assimilated.^336 When not
used in association with the foreigners the word Mleccha is
used for one who is impure, dirty or uncultured. It is derived
from the root §mlich~mlech,^337 meaning to speak indistinctly
(like a foreigner or barbarian who does not speak Sanskrit).
We find the use of root in Mahābhāṣya.^338
The Sanskrit term Mleccha, referring to the indistinct
speech of some non-Āryans, is taken from proto-Bodish (proto-
Tibetan) mltśe “tongue”, Old Bodish ltśe, Kukish generally
mlei, the combination of initial consonants (mltś — ) being
simplified in various ways in different Tibeto-Burmic languages.
Aspiration cannot occur after I in old Bodish; and the proto-
Bodish form may have been mltse for all we know, so the ‘cch’
of Sanskrit “Mleccha may come nearer the primitive affricate
than anything preserved in the Tibeto-Burmic languages.
Since ‘mleche’ would be an impossible combination in Sanskrit,
mleccha would be as close as a Sanskrit speaker could come to
it”.^339
Mleccha^340 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^341 in the
sense of a barbarian in speech. Here the brāhmaṇas are for-
bidden to use barbarian speech. The example^342 given of such
speech is “he' layo”, explained by Sāyaṇa as “he' rayaḥ”, “ho,
foes”. The barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though
not speakers of Sanskrit, but of a Prakrit form of speech.^343
An ancient tradition regards the Andhras, Pulindas and
Śabaras as dog-eaters or Mlecchas.^344 The Jain Prajñāpanā
records two divisions of the people of India — Milikkha and
Ārya, and enumerates 53 people in the former group, some of
which are the Saga, Javana, Sabara, Vavvara, Hoṇa, Romaya,
Pārasa and Khasa.^345
The Mahābhārata^346 states that the Mlecchas dwelt in the
Yavana, Cīna and Kamboja countries. In a dual between
Karṇa and Śalya, Karṇa highly condemns the people of the
Vāhīka and especially of the Madra Country and describes
them as the Mleccha, the dirt among the human beings.^347
They belong to unpious countries and are totally ignorant
about the Dharma (righteous conduct).^348 At another place,
it is stated that the Yavanas are the Mlecchas, though they
follow their own ways (i. e. not following the Vedic Orthodoxy)
yet they are full of knowledge and brave but the Vāhīkas and
the Madras are condemned as utterly foolish.^349 This makes it
clear that the people not following the righteous conduct
according to the Āryan beliefs, whether indigenous or foreign,
were labelled as the Mlecchas. The Mahābhārata^350 shows that
the coastal regions were the favourite resort of the Mlecchas
and that they were dreadful. The Epic describes the Mlecchas
as being impure because they were of bovine extraction and
describes them as fierce and cruel.^351
In the Manu-Smṛti^352 the king is advised to exclude at
deliberation time, the foolish, dumb, blind, and deaf, birds,
the aged, women; the Mlecchas (the impure), diseased and
deformed. At another place in the Manu-Smṛti where the girls
bearing the names after a star, a tree, (or) a river, one called
after the Antyas or a mountain, one called after a bird, snake,
or slave or with a terrifying name are forbidden for marriage,
Kullūka, the commentator on Manu explains the word Antya as
representing the Mlecchas.^353 From the Manu^354 it is clear
that the Mlecchas spoke a different language than the Āryans.
The Vāyu, Matsya and Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇas state that the
seven Himalayan rivers pass through the Mleccha countries.^355
In the Varāha Purāṇa, a place named Lohārgala is stated to be
ruled over by the Mleccha kings.^356
The Amara-kośa^357 describes the Kirātas, Śabaras and
Pulindas as the Mlecchajātis. The Bṛhat-Saṃhitā^358 places
them in the West and describes them as unrighteous. It places
them under the jurisdiction of Maṅgala graha^359 and assigns
them the region of Rāhu graha, inhabiting the mountain-tops,
low-regions or the caves.^360 In the ‘life’ of Hiuen Tsang, all
places to the north of Lamgham district have been described as
Mi-li-ku, i. e. frontier or Mleccha lands.^361
In the Ārya-mañjūśrī-Mūla-kalpa, the Mlecchas frequently
appear as the companions of robbers.^362 In the Kathāsarit-
Sāgara,^363 the Mlecchas are connected with Sindh. They are
stated to have killed brāhmaṇas, interfered with sacrifices, and
carried off the daughters of hermits.^364 The Rājataraṅgiṇī^365
mentions the Mlecchas as issuing forth from the valleys adjoin-
ing the Himalayas.
In medieval inscriptions, the name Mleccha has been applied
indiscriminately to all foreigners.^366 The Mleccha army of the
Gwalior Praśasti of Bhoja consisted of the Arabs.^367 The
Mlecchas of the inscriptions of the medieval period refer to
Muhammadans and the people of Baluchistan.^368
The Siddhānta-Kaumudī^369 describes the Kṣudhunas as the
Mlecchas. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra (a work of the 17th
century), we get reference to the Mleccha (verse 24), Mahām-
leccha (verses 28, 30) and Mleccha-mārga (verse 31) where they
are mentioned along with Pāñcāla, Kāmboja and Bāhlīka and
the Khurāśan country is described as the Mleccha-mārga.^370

मुरुण्डस्
14. Muruṇḍas (No. 1, L. 23):
Muruṇḍa is mentioned in the Allahabad Pillar Inscription of
Samudragupta along with the terms Daivaputra, Ṣāhi Ṣāhān-
uṣāhi and Śaka as one compound expression.^371 Fleet takes
Śakas and Muruṇḍas as two separate tribes. They were one of
the foreign potentates who came of their own accord to offer
allegiance to Samudragupta.
According to Sten Konow ‘muruṇḍa’ is the later form of
a Śaka word meaning ‘lord’ or ‘master’. The term ‘Śaka-
Muruṇḍa’ therefore possibly stands for those Śaka lords or
chieftains who were ruling in the regions of Surāṣṭra and
Ujjain at the time of Samudragupta.^372
But we find in the Khoh plates of Mahārāja Sarvanātha
the names ‘Muruṇḍadevī’^373 and Muruṇḍasvāminī^374 which
shows that Muruṇḍa was the name of a tribe and not a title.
On the basis of Khoh plates, Smith^375 suggested that “the
Muruṇḍas may possibly have been settled in the hill country of
Riwa along the Kaimur range or more probably further south
in the Vindhya or north Dekkan or possibly in the Chhota-
nagpur”.
According to R.K. Mookerji,^376 the people called here as
the Muruṇḍas are to be distinguished from the Śakas and may
be identified with the Kuṣāṇas, as earlier suggested by Sten
Konow.^377
We know that the term Daivaputra in the inscription has
been used to refer to the Kuṣāṇa kings, and Śakas are men-
tioned separately. So we cannot equate Muruṇḍas with the
Kuṣāṇas as suggested by R.K. Mookerji.
Some scholars regard Muruṇḍa as the name of a powerful
foreign tribe, ruling in the upper Ganges valley.^378 According
to the Chinese authority, the Capital of Meou-lun (a word
equated with Muruṇḍa) was 7,000 li from the mouth of the
Great River, which was undoubtedly the Ganges. Allan is,
therefore, not right in suggesting that the Chinese description
of the capital refers to Pāṭaliputra.^379 Jayaswal took Śaka-
Muruṇḍa to denote the smaller Śaka rulers like the ‘Shalada,
Shaka and the Gadahara chiefs as well as the Western
Satraps’.^380
In the Abhidhāna-Cintāmaṇi^381 and the Vaijayantī^382 the
Lampākas are identified with Muruṇḍas. The Lampākas are
the same as the Lambatai of Ptolemy.^383 The Purāṇas,^384
mention Lampākas, the people who were residing in Lampāka,
the modern Laghman in Afghanistan. Rājaśekhara seems to be
referring to Lampāka as Limpaka.^385
The Muruṇḍas seem to be a foreign tribe. Muruṇḍa is
clearly a non-Āryan word and can have no Āryan derivation.^386
Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.) mentions the Muruṇḍas for the
first time under the name Moroundai and places them on the
western border of the ‘Gangaridai’. They seem to have occu-
pied an extensive territory, probably the whole of North-Bihar
on the east of the Gaṅgā, as far as the head of the delta. They
had six important cities, all to the east of the Gaṅgā: Boraita,
Koryagaza, Kondota, Kelydna, Aganegora and Talarga. These
places are difficult to identify but to Saint-Martin Kelydna
appeared to have some relation with Kālinadī or Kālindī river,
and Aganagora with Aghadip (Agradvīpa) on the eastern bank
of the Ganges, a little below Katwa.^387
According to Cunningham, the name of the Marundai is
still preserved in the country of the Muṇḍas, a hill tribe
scattered over Chhota-Nagpur and Central India.^388 But M.S.
Pandey^389 opposes the view on the ground that the Muruṇḍas
dwelt in the north-west with other foreign tribes. The evidence
is strong enough to show that the Muruṇḍas had not spread so
far to the east as to occupy the Chhota-Nagpur region. How-
ever, barbarous and pastoral the Muruṇḍas might have been
before their immigration into India, when they held the sceptre
in their hands they must have been endowed with the quality
and capacity to rule over a people who were highly civilized.
Such a race could hardly have sunk to a position so low as
that of the Muṇḍas of the modern times. Moreover, the
Muṇḍas are a dominant division of the aboriginals of the
Chhota-Nagpur region. Had they been the descendants of the
Muruṇḍas, we should have found them in other parts of
Central India also, and not confined to this small region so far
from their place of origin.^390
M.S. Pandey^391 disagrees with the Puranic account on the
basis that many discrepancies have crept in owing to the mis-
takes of the copyists.

पुष्यमित्रस्
16. Puṣyamitras (No. 13, L. 11):
The Bhitari Stone Pillar Inscription^397 records Skandagupta's
victory over a powerful enemy called the Puṣyamitras, who
possessed a strong army and a rich treasury: he (Skandagupta)
placed (his) left foot on a foot-stool which was the king (of
that tribe himself).^398 H.R. Divekar suggested the reading
Yudhy-amitrān in place of Puṣyamitrān. But, as pointed out by
R.D. Banerji,^399 the proposed reading is impossible.
There are several views about the identification of the
Puṣyamitras.
(i) Fleet identified them with the people mentioned in the
Purāṇas as Paṭumitras and located them on the
Narmadā.^400
(ii) V.A. Smith^401 regarded them as a people of the North.
(iii) Hoernle believed that they were the same as the
Maitrakas.^402
(iv) R.D. Banerji^403 regarded them as the first wave of the
Hūṇas.
(v) N.K. Bhattasali has suggested that the Puṣyamitras
were the descendants of king Puṣyavarmā of Assam.^404
Bhattasali says that a pun (śleṣa) has been used for “the
descendants of Puṣyavarman of Assam who had so long been
mitras or friends of the Guptas, but had change into foes by
their desire for conquest and had invaded the Gupta empire from
the east and made it totter”. But as remarked by D.C. Sircar,
“there is no grammatical, lexicographical, or literary support,
for this interpretation of the name Puṣyamitra”.^405
Bhattasali opines that Mahendravarman, whom he assigns
to the period A.D. 450 to 490 who performed two horse-sacri-
fices must have been powerful enough to launch an attack on
the Gupta empire in the reign of Skandagupta.
We know that the definite limits of Skandagupta's reign
are from A.D. 455 to 467. The period of the rule of
Mahendravarman, however, cannot be so definitely fixed because
we do not possess any dated records of his reign. As a matter
of fact the entire chronology of the kings of Assam can be
settled approximately only by means of synchronisms and rough
calculations. The attack on the Gupta empire by the Varmans
of Assam in the reign of Skandagupta is an impossibility.^406
The Puṣyamitras cannot be a branch of the Hūṇas as held by
R.D. Banerji. The Hūṇas have been mentioned separately in
the Bhitari Inscription.^407 “By whose (Skandagupta's) two
arms the earth was shaken, when he, the creator (of a distur-
bance like that) of a terrible whirlpool, joined in close conflict
with the Hūṇas”. Hoernle's view that “the Puṣyamitras were the
same as Maitrakas who some years later under the leadership
of Bhaṭārka established themselves in Valabhī probably with
the help of the Hūṇa ruler Toramāṇa”;^408 is also not accept-
able as the Maitrakas remained subservient to the Imperial
Guptas from the time of Bhaṭārka to that of Droṇasiṃha.^409
Therefore, they cannot be the same as Puṣyamitras who rebelled
against Skandagupta.
The Purāṇas mention a people called Puṣyamitras, whose
rule commenced after the end of the dynasty of the Vindhyakas.
In the Viṣṇupurāṇa MSS. consulted by Prof. Wilson we have
the following statement: “and Puṣpamitras, and Paṭumitras
and others to the number of thirteen will rule over Mekalā”.^410
Prof. Wilson has added the following note, “It seems most
correct to separate the thirteen sons or families of the Vindhya
princes from these Bāhlikas and then from the Puṣyamitras and
Paṭumitras who governed Mekalā, a country on the Nar-
madā”.^411
A similar statement is to be found in the Vāyupurāṇa,
according to which ‘the Puṣyamitras and Paṭumitras are
grouped with the rulers of Mekalā, whose seven kings have not
been named.^412
The mention of Vindhyakas, evidently a people of the
Vindhya region, and of Mekalā, points to the south rather than
to North. So the view of V.A. Smith that the Puṣyamitras were
a people of the North is not acceptable.
Thus the view of Fleet that the Puṣyamitras are to be placed
in Central India somewhere in the country along the banks of
the Narmadā, seems to be most reasonable.^413 This is supported
by numismatic evidence, a hoard of coins brought to light by
D.B. Diskalkar,^414 from the village of Bamnala, 24 miles to
the south of the Narmadā, indicates that there was a serious
disturbance of peace in the vicinity of Mekalā, in the middle
of the fifth century A.D. and we may connect it with the rising
of the Puṣyamitras in that region.^415

साहानुषाहि
17. Sāhānuṣāhi^416 (No. 1, L. 23):
Ṣāhānuṣāhis are also mentioned to have paid homage to
Samudragupta along with other tribes. The Ṣāhānuṣāhis are
to be identified with the Sassanids or the Sassanian kings. The
title ‘Sāhānuṣāhi (śahān-śāh) has frequently been used by the
Sassanian kings.^417 The contemporary Sassanian emperor was
Shahpur II (A.D. 309-379).^418 The Sassanians are known to
have been the rulers of Persia from A.D. 211 to 651.^419 Accord-
ing to tradition the dynasty is named after its founder Sassan.
His son and successor Papaka, seized power by a coup d'etat
against his suzerain, the Parthian king and his accession was
the starting point for a new era (A.D. 208).^420
Goyal^421 confuses the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
Kālidāsa. But they were different from the Pārasīkas. The
Sassanians had founded a powerful kingdom in Persia, but they
had not yet conquered the whole of Persia.^422 The Pārasīkas
of Kālidāsa were the Ṣāhis.^423 Though the possibility of a
Kuṣāṇa-Sassanian coalition may not be ruled out it seems that
at the time of Samudragupta,^424 three kings the Daivaputra (the
Kuṣāṇas), the Ṣāhi (the Persians or the Pārasīkas of Kālidāsa),
and the Ṣāhānuṣāhi (the Sassanians) were ruling indepen-
dently.^425
Buddha Prakash^426 traces the Khatri sub-castes Sahni and
Osahan as the remnants of the title ‘Ṣāhānuṣāhi’. But this is
far-fetched. So far as Sahni is concerned it is to be connected
with Sādhanika the name of an officer in the administration of
the early medieval period.^427
It may be noted that the Sassanian title Śahan-Śāh was
used for the Great Emperor in Mughal period, which usage
continues. In popular parlance the term is used for calling or
receiving some person respectively.

षाहि
18. Ṣāhi^428 (No. 1, L. 23):
The Ṣāhis are said to have paid homage to Samudragupta.
From the appendix it is clear that Daivaputra is not an adjec-
tive of Ṣāhi as Goyal^429 has surmised and has identified it
with Kidāra Kuṣāṇa of the Great Kuṣāṇa family.
Daivaputras have been interpreted to denote the Kuṣāṇas;
so Ṣāhis cannot be identified with the Kuṣāṇas. They must
have been an independent and separate tribe, and may be
identified with the Persians mentioned in the Raghuvaṃśa in
connexion with the North-Westren conquests of Raghu.^430
Goyal^431 identifies the Sassanians with the Pārasīkas of
Kālidāsa. But Pārasīkas can never be identified with Sassanians.
The word ‘Pārasīkas’ itself clearly be speaks of the Persians and
is identical with the modern Parasis. Moreover, Ṣāhānuṣāhis
are to be identified with the Sassanians whereas Ṣāhis refer to
the Persians. Even now the king of Persia (Iran) is known as
‘Shāh of Iran’.
Ṣāhi is an Iranian or Persian word and seems to have some
relation with Sanskrit root §śās to rule, which when formed a
noun means ‘a ruler’. ^432 The Śāhi dynasty of Kabul was ousted
by the brāhmaṇa minister of the last king. The new dynasty was
also known as the Śāhis and has been mentioned by Al-Beruni
and Kalhaṇa.
The word Śāha or Sāhu, often used for banias in villages,
is not connected with Ṣāhi or Śāhi but is to be derived from
Sanskrit ‘sādhu’.^433

19. Saiṃhalaka (No. 1, L. 23):
Inhabitants of Siṃhala or Ceylon. They are mentioned along
with the Daivaputras, Ṣāhis, Ṣāhānuṣāhis, Śakas and Muruṇḍas,
and all (other) dwellers in islands (probably the islands of
Southern Sea such as Jāvā and Sumātrā)^434 who paid homage
to Samudragupta by offering themselves for services, bringing
presents of maidens, praying for charters bearing the imperial
Gupta Garuḍa seal (Garutmadaṅka) by which they would be
left undisturbed by the emperor in the enjoyment (bhukti) and
administration (śāsana) of their respective territories.^435 If
literally interpreted the inscription will suggest that the people
mentioned here were really tributaries under Samudragupta.
When we see from the inscription itself that the Tamil states
were left undisturbed, the inclusion of even distant Siṃhala
(Ceylon) and all other islands in this category raises great
doubts about this interpretation, and we shall hardly be justi-
fied in taking the words of the Court-poet in their literal sense
without corroborative evidence.^436 But the question arises that
was the conquest of Tāmraparṇī (Siṃhala) by Aśoka in his
Rock Edict II also a simple boast of this kind?^437
So far as Ceylon is concerned, we have fortunately an
independent evidence of its political relation with Samuda-
gupta.
We know that after the death of king Mahāsena (A.D. 334 — 62)
of the Lambakarṇa clan his son Sumeghavarṇa (chi-mi-kia-
po-mo = “cloud of merit”) became king of Ceylon who was a
contemporary of Samudragupta (San-meou-to-lo-kin-to).^438 He,
according to a Chinese text, sent two monks to Bodh-Gayā to
visit the sacred spots, but they were put to great inconvenience
for want of suitable accommodation. To remove this difficulty
for future pilgrims to the holy place, Meghavarṇa decided to
found a monastery there. He accordingly sent a mission to
Samudragupta with rich presents and asked for permission,
and the Ceylonese king built a splendid monastery to the north
of the Bodhi tree.^439
By the time of Hiuen Tsang it had developed into a magni-
ficant establishment, with more than 1,000 priests, and the
pilgrim has described the rich decorations and massive grand-
eur of the buildings. Referring to the old history of its
foundation Hiuen Tsang says that the Ceylonese king ‘gave in
tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country’. “It
is likely that Samudragupta's courtier also regarded the rich
presents as a tribute, and construed the Ceylonese king's
prayer for permission to build a monastery into an ‘application
for charter confirming him in the enjoyment of his territories’,
one of the forms of homage paid by the category of states into
which Siṃhala is included”.^440
Siṃhala is generally identified with Laṅkā. But Varāhami-
hira^441 mentions both of them separately as situated in the
South.
Laṅkā has been identified differently by various scholars
with Laṅkā of Madhyadeśa,^442 with Maldives,^443 with the
northern part of the Andhra country on the shores of the Bay
of Bengal,^444 and with an island off the south-east Coast of Cey-
lon.^445 All these theories are refuted by S.B. Chaudhuri^446 who
remarks that the assumption that Laṅkā is not Ceylon is gra-
tuitous.^447 He points out that in the Rāmāyaṇa Rāvaṇa while
entreating Sītā to be his wife says: “Laṅkānāma samudrasya
madhye mama mahāpurī sāgareṇa parikṣiptā niviṣṭā... ”^448
Hanuman makes a similar statement in describing the strategi-
cal position of Laṅkā: Sthitā pāre samudrasya dūrapārasya.^449
Kālidāsa in his Raghuvaṃśa in connexion with ‘Purīm Laṅkām’
writes: “Mahārṇava parikṣepam lankāyāḥ parikhālaghum”.^450
With regard to the bridge built by Rāma Kālidāsa notes: sa
setuṃ bandhayāmāsa plavaṅgairlavaṇāmbhasi.^451 In the Skanda
Purāṇa^452 and in the Kathāsaritsāgara, we have similar references
to Laṇkā.^453 All these passages point distinctly to the great sea
on the other side of which was situated the great city of Laṅkā.
The separate mention of Siṃhala and Laṅkā in many
Sanskrit texts is quoted to show that Laṅkā was distinct from
Ceylon.^454 This is hardly convincing for the separate mention
of Mathurā and Śūrasena, Sāketa and Kosala, Gāndhāra
and Takṣaśilā, Avanti and Ujjainī, did not imply any material
geographical difference as they were treated only as convertible
terms in geographical texts of the Purāṇas. In the Puranic
lists, Laṇkā is a territorial name and Siṃhala is an ethnic name.
As the name of a city in the island of Siṃhala, Laṅkā passed
off as a dvīpa, and the two names were used in the same
geographical sense. A passage in the Rāmāyaṅa runs thus:
“Siṃhalān barbarān mlecchān ye ca laṅkānivāsinaḥ”.^455 Hiuen
Tsang also mentions Seng-ka-lo (Ceylon) which included Leug-
ka (Laṅkā).^456 As pointed out by B.C. Law, the Mahāvaṃśa
and its commentary show that Laṅkādvīpa (the lower portion)
was one of the main divisions of the island of Ceylon.^457
It is a valid presumption, therefore, that the ancient name
Laṅkā referred to Ceylon.^458 We may assume further, as seems
very likely, that Laṅkā was the early name of Ceylon and its
literary name as well. Mention is made of Laṅkādvīpa even in
medieval inscriptions.^459 The Madras museum plates of Jaṭila-
varman refer to the beautiful island of Laṅkā as Ilangai.^460 Epi-
graphic evidence, however, shows that Siṃhala, another name
of ancient Ceylon, was equally well known. Thus the Kanhad
plate of Kṛṣṇa III refers to the island of Siṃhala.^461 In another
inscription the king of Siṃhala is described as waiting on the
shore.^462 In other inscriptions Siṃhala is variously designated
as Siṅgala-deśam,^463 Sīlam^464 and Sihala.^465 All this evidence
favours the suggestion that as territorial names Siṃhala and
Laṅkā were convertible terms, although the latter is also
used as the name of a city. Priaulx remarks and probably,
correctly, that Laṅkā was the old mythological name for
Ceylon, and that later on it was supplanted by Tāmraparṇī,
and subsequently when the Periplus was written, by Palaesi-
mundus or Palaesimoundon which itself was transformed into
Salike, Sereṇdiva derived from Pali Sihala or Sihala dīpa.^466
The name Palaesimoundon is very plausibly based on “pāre
samudrasya”,^467 in the description given of Laṅkā as noted
above. Ptolemy's Simoundon^468 also refers to that name. But
in Ptolemy's Geography the island is called Salike which
responds to Siele diba of Kosmas Indicopleustes^469 both of
which have their sources in Sihalam “the Pāli form of Sanskrit
Siṃhala” or Ceylon. To this source may be traced its other
names such as Serendib, Zeilan, Sialan,^470 the last one yielding
to Ceylon. Marco Polo's Seilan^471 is a nearer approach to the
modern name. Van-der-turk suggests that the name may have
been derived from Sela or ‘precious stone’, hence the island
was anciently called Ratnadvīpa.^472 An Arab historian called
it the “Island of Rubies”. The Chinese name for the island
also implies reference to gems. The name Sailān also occurs in
the works of Rashiduddin, Hayton and Jordanus.^473 Al-Beruni
called it Singaldīb.^474 Siṃhala is perhaps so called as once
abounding in lions.^475
We may note here that there are references to another
Siṃhala quite different from Ceylon.^476 It was placed to the
east of Marudeśa and to the south of the Kāmādri. It is evi-
dently in the Punjab-Rajasthan region and reminds us of the
kingdom of Siṃhapura mentioned by Hiuen Tsang.

20. Śaka (No. 1, L. 23):
One of the tribes which is said to have paid homage to
Samudragupta. As we have already discussed in connexion
with the Muruṇḍas, the expression, ‘Śaka-Muruṇḍa’ should
not be translated to mean Śaka-lords. Following Fleet^477
we may better split the expression into two distinct names,
the Śakas and Muruṇḍas.
The Śakas in the time of Samudragupta (4th century A.D.)
must be the Śakas of Western India belonging to the Satrapal
family of Caṣṭana and Rudradāman. In this period the Śaka
ruler was Rudrasiṃha II and his successor Rudrasiṃha III,
whose coins come up to A.D. 390, was killed by Candragupta
II.^478 Other persons of that nationality were ruling in and
about Sāñcī.^479
The Scyths, whom Indians named as Śakas, were originally
living on the borders of Bactria. A nomadic people called
Yueh-Chih by the Chinese forced them to move from that
place. Eventually in the beginning of the first century B.C., the
Śakas moved on from Bactria to attack first the Parthians of
Iran, and then the Greeks in India.^480
By the middle of the Ist Century B.C. there remained only
a few petty Greek chiefs in India, and the power of the Śakas
reached Mathurā. The Śakas continued the earlier practice
of issuing coins with bilingual legends in Greek and Prakrit.
The earliest Śaka king in India was Maues (about C. 80
B.C.)^481
Towards the close of the first Century A.D., the Sātavāhanas
were pushed out from the North-West Deccan by the invad-
ing Śakas of the Kṣaharāta clan; but the Śatavāhanas under
the greatest of their rulers, Gautamīputra Śātakarṇin recover-
ed their lands about A.D. 130. After this event nothing more
is heard of the Kṣaharātas.^482
Another Śaka dynasty, called the Kārddamaka family but
generally known as the “Western Satraps”, gained control of
Kathiawar and Malwa at about the same time, and ruled
roughly upto A.D. 400, and at the height of their power govern-
ing much of Rajasthan and Sind also. The greatest ruler of
this dynasty was Rudradāman, who has left the earliest impor-
tant inscription in correct Sanskrit,^483 a long panegyric which
records his martial exploits, and his reconstruction of a great
artificial lake at Girnar in Kathiawar, which had been excava-
ted under Candragupta and improved in the time of Aśoka.
This inscription is among the earliest certainly dated records
of ancient India, and proves that Rudradāman was reigning in
A.D. 150.^484
Samudragupta's main effort was in the direction of the
West, where the Śakas had ruled for over 200 years and which
was enriched by the lucrative western trade. The Śakas at
that time controlled Malwa and Kathiawar and were a power
to be reckoned with. ‘Though the Allahabad Pillar Inscription
claims that Samudragupta received homage from “the Śaka
lords”, it is probable that he did not measure swords with
them’.^485 It is clear that the Śaka homage to Samudragupta
was not at all sincere and reliable since it was not tendered
to his successor,^486 and Candragupta II had to conquer the
Śakas once again.
There is indeed a tradition that on the death of Samudra-
gupta the Śakas succeeded in shaking the Gupta Empire, and
forced the weak king, Rāmagupta, to conclude a dishonour-
able peace.^487 Most authorities reject the story, and deny the
historicity of Rāmagupta, but the recent discovery of copper
coins bearing his name^488 strengthens the suggestion that
the tradition has a basis of fact.^489
It was Candragupta II (C. 376-415), the son of Samudra-
gupta and younger brother of the shadowy Rāmagupta, who
finally defeated the Śakas, soon after A.D. 388^490 So he is
rightly remembered as ‘Śakāri’ ‘the enemy of the Śakas’.^491
The trousers were introduced into India by the Śakas and
seem to have been in vogue among the ruling classes during
the Gupta times, for Gupta kings often appear on their coins
as wearing trousers.^492
The Śakas were notorious drinkers. It is said that Cyrus
defeated the Śakas, when they were maddened by wine.^493
It has been suggested by Buddha Prakash that as a result of
the influence of the Śakas, the vogue for excessive drinking
spread. Strabo^494 speaks of a Bacchanalian festival of the
Persian, in which men and women, dressed in Scythian style
passed day and night in drinking and wanton play.^495 We
know of similar drinking bouts in the Mahābhārata.^496 Prob-
ably the Scythians and the Iranians popularised drinking in
the Punjab. The people of the Gangetic country, sticking to
pristine ideals of moderation did not relish the exotic drink-
ing bouts popularised in the Punjab, under Śaka and Persian
influence. Baudhāyana in his Dharmasūtra, Karṇa in the
Mahābhārata, and the Buddha in his discourses denounced
drinking and laid down a prohibition against it.^497 But all
this is not agreeable since Buddha and Baudhāyana belong to a
period before the coming of the Śakas. Āryans have been
great lovers of drinking. We can find sufficient evidence for
the drinking before Śakas.
We may here refer to the Śaka Era (A.D. 78), which is
very popular in India even to-day. Traditionally this era is
known to have been founded by a Śaka king who occupied
Ujjayinī 137 years after Vikramāditya. The era may in fact
have been founded by Kaniṣka. It was certainly used early in
the 2nd Centuary A.D. by the “Western Satraps”, who ruled
Malwa, Kathiawar and Gujarat. Thence, the use of the era
spread through the Deccan and was exported to South-East
Asia.^498 Because of its long association with the Śaka Satraps
the era may have earned its present name.
The Śakas came to be included in the category of the mart-
ial classes of ancient India. Manu^499 refers to the warlike
people on the fringes of Āryan civilization, including the
Greeks (Yavana), the Scyths (Śaka), and the Parthians (Pah-
lava), as kṣatriyas who had fallen from grace through their
neglect of the sacred law, but who could be received once more
into Āryan fold by adopting the orthodox way of life and
performing appropriate penitential sacrifices.^500
The Śakas were a white-skinned tribe or race of people; in
the legends which relate the contests between Vasiṣṭha and
Viśvāmitra, the Śakas are fabled to have been produced by
the cow of Vasiṣṭha, from her sweat, for the destruction of
Viśvāmitra's army.^501
Buddha Prakash^502 traces the Śaka invasion on the basis
of literary and linguistic considerations.
The name of the capital of the Madras, Śākala, and that of
the region between the Ravi and the Chenab, Śākaladvīpa, are
based on the word Śaka and are indicative of a Śaka invasion.
Likewise, the name of the clan Śākya, to which Buddha
belonged, enshrines a reminiscence of the word Śaka.
Moreover, the place-names ending in kanthā existing in the
whole of the Punjab from the Bannu valley to the Kankhala
region and even beyond suggest an intrusion of the Śakas long
before the time of Pāṇini,^503 who is known to have flourished
one century before the invasion of Alexander, the Great.
Kanthā is a Śaka word for city^504 and is akin to kadhāvara or
kanthāvara of Kharoṣṭhī inscriptions, Kand of Persian, Kanthā
of Khotanese, Kandh of Sogdian, Kandai of Pushto, Kanda
or Koent of the dialect of the Ṛṣikas. It is significant
that the land beyond the Oxus, the Urheimat of the Śakas,
abounds in Kanthā-ending place names, such as Samarkand,
Khokand, Chimkand, Tashkand, Panjkand, and Yarkand.
The reference to the stepped-well, called Śakandhu after
the Śakas, together with that worked by Persian Wheel, known
as Karkandhu after the Karkians, in a vārttika of Katyāyana^505
also leads to the same conclusion.
At the time of Alexander's invasion the Śakas lived at the
north-western borders of India. That this tide of Śaka inva-
sion, descending from the north-west, touched the eastern
extremity of India, is manifest from the traditions of the
Purāṇas that the Śakas advanced to Ayodhyā during the reign
of King Bāhu and that his son Sagara checked and repelled
them.^506
In the Mahābhārata the Śakas are stated to have constitut-
ed along with Cūlikas, Tuṣāras and Yavanas, the right wing
of the Krauñcavyūha formed by Bhīṣma on the sixth day of
the battle. ^507 Caraka in his medical treatise^508 refers to them
in the context of Central Asiatic tribes, viz. Bāhlika, Pahlava,
Cīna, Yavana and Śaka.^509
Buddha Prakash also tries to trace the remnants of the
Śakas in modern times.^510
The Śakas came into Punjab after the Yavanas or the
Greeks. During their long rule they contributed a great deal
to Indian culture and ultimately became one with the Indian
people.^511 The depth of their influence on Indian society is
manifest from the word thakura, which implies the ideas of
nobility and divinity and stands for the Rajputs in the Punjab
and is derived from the word thagora, taugara or tukhara.^512
The name Tukhāra itself survives in the name of the Tokhi
caste found in the North-West.^513 Another caste called Khosla
is a survival of Kusulaka, the surname of the Kṣaharāta
chiefs Liaka Kusulaka and his son Patika Kusuluka. Analogous
to this word is the name of Kuzula Kadphises the first Kuṣāṇa
emperor to advance towards the Punjab. Hultzsch has equated
this word with Turki güjlü meaning ‘strong’, and Sten Konow
has compared it with Turki guzel, meaning ‘beautiful’, but
Lüders has shown that it is the name of a family or clan of
the Śakas.^514 So the name of Khosla is a remnant of this
tribe.^515 Besides the Thakuras and Tokhis of the Punjab,
there are caste-groups of Soi and Sikka, which are reminiscent
of the Śakas.

21. Sanakānīka (No. 1, L. 22; No. 3, L. 2):
In Inscription No. 3 it occurs with the short ‘i’ in the fourth
syllable, i. e. as ‘Sanakānika’.^516
The Sanakānīkas were also subjugated by Samudragupta
along with other tribes who payed him all kinds of taxes,
obeyed his orders and were coming to perform obeisance.^517
In the Udayagiri Cave Inscription of Candragupta II, of the
Year 82 (A.D. 401) (No. 3), we know of a Mahārāja of the
‘Sanakānīka’ tribe or family, who was a feudatory of Candra-
gupta II and who is stated to have recorded his gift on a Vaiṣ-
ṇava Cave temple at Udayagiri.^518 Udayagiri is a well-known
hill about two miles to the north-west of Bhilsa, ancient
Vidiśā.^519 Thus we can say that the Sanakānīkas lived in the
neighbourhood of Bhilsa.^520 D.R. Bhandarkar mentions them
to have held the province of Vidiśā but he also locates Gaṇa-
patināga's kingdom (one of the kings subjugated by Samudra-
gupta) in Vidiśā.^521 So his view seems to be inconsistent.
It may be noted that the Sanakānīka feudatory chief of
Candragupta II, as well as his father and grandfather, bore the
title Mahārāja. This may suggest that the Sanakānīkas, and
probably other tribes mentioned along with them in the
Allahabad Pillar Inscription were not tribal republics, as is
generally supposed, but were ruled by hereditary chiefs.^522
The name of the grandfather of this Sanakānīka feudatory
chief of Candragupta II, is given as Chagalaga ‘which looks
like a foreign name’;^523 but his father bears a purely Hindu
name: ‘Viṣṇudāsa’. Of course the present chief's name is
illegible in the inscription (No. 3).^524 But considering the trend
it may be surmised that his name also was a Sanskrit name.^525
It seems that the tribe which originally consisted of aboriginal
people was gradually coming under the influence of Sanskrit
culture.

वाह्लिक
22. Vāhlika (No. 20, L. 2):
The Meharaulī Pillar Inscription (No. 20) describes the dig-
vijaya of a king named Candra (i. e. Candragupta II) in the
first verse as stated below: “He, on whose arm fame was
inscribed by the sword, when, in battle in the Vaṅga count-
ries, he kneaded (and turned) back with (his) breast the enemi-
es who, uniting together, came against him; — he, by whom,
having crossed in warfare the seven mouths of the (river)
Sindhu, the Vāhlikas were conquered; — he, by the breezes of
whose prowess the Southern ocean is even still perfumed”.^526
We find various readings of the name Vāhlika in literature
which are: Vāhlika, Bāhlika, Vāhlīka and Bāhlīka. In our
inscription (No. 20) ‘Vāhlikāḥ’, i. e. Vāhlika in plural denotes
the people of Vāhlika i. e. Bactria (modern Balkh) region on
the Oxus in the northern part of Afghanistan.^527
Mislead by a verse in the Rāmāyaṇa,^528 D.R. Bhandarkar^529
places Vāhlikas in the close proximity of the Vipāśā, the
modern Beas. The reading Vāhlīkān in the passage quoted
from the Rāmāyaṇa is a mistake for Vāhīkān. Numerous
passages can be quoted from the Epic, Puranic and classical
Sanskrit literature to prove that the Punjab = Pañcanada, ‘the
land of five rivers’, was in ancient times called the Vāhīka
country.^530
‘Vāhīka’ was, in fact, a general term for the whole of
Punjab. We know Śākala as Vāhīka-grāma from Patañjali and
also Pātanaprastha which is modern Pathankot by the same
term. Moreover, Vatsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra and Rajaśekhara
in his Kāvya-mīmāṃsā mention the people of Bāhlīka and
Punjab as two separate entities. ^531
There is, however, one verse in the Karṇaparvan of the
Mahābhārata which suggests that Vāhīka was originally the
name of a country or people on the Vipāśā, (the Beas): “In
the Vipāśā, there were two Piśācas named Vahi and Hika;
their descendants are called Vāhīkas who are not the creation
of Prajāpati”.^532
Later on the sense of the word expanded to cover all the
tribes living in the Punjab. It is interesting to note that the
Māhābhārata sometimes uses the terms Vāhīka, Madra, Jartika,
Āraṭṭa and Pañcanada synonymously. It appears that the lands
of these tribes which lived close to one another became in
course of time moulded into a big kingdom under the powerful
kings of Śākala (Sialkot). As Vāhīka was beyond Kurukshetra
and, therefore, outside the boundary of Brahmāvarta, its ana-
logical connection with the word ‘bahis’ may have been another
cause of the expansion of its geographical sense.^533 This is
also reflected in the Vārttikas of Katyāyana who derives the
word ‘Vāhīka’ from ‘vahis’ or ‘bahis’, meaning ‘outside’ (the
pale of Āryandom).^534
Some scholars^535 rely on the description of the Bāhlikas
as the offspring of two Piśācas, Bahi and Hika, as given in
the Mahābhārata. Buddha Prakash holds that fresh stream
of the Bactrian people which swooped over the Punjab came
to be known as Bālhikas; their name which became a general
designation for the people of Punjab was later corrupted as
Vāhīka.^536 But we have already shown that the two were
separate entities.
We know that the Vāhīkas were the people living within
the boundaries of the five rivers including the sixth Sindhu
(Indus),^537 but according to the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription
Candragupta conquered Vāhlikas after crossing the seven
months of the (river) Indus (sapta mukhāni sindhoḥ).^538 So
Vāhlika of our inscription is certainly Balkh in the extreme
north of Afghanistan.^539 Bajpai^540 opposes it on the ground
that Candragupta could not have gone to so far off a place as
Bactria which is situated across the Hindukush and rejects
the older contention of scholars that the Kuṣāṇas were ruling
in Bactria during king Candra's campaign and that he crossed
the Hindukush to crush them.
But the view of Bajpai is not tenable since it is clear from
the lines in our inscription^541 that king Candra had conquered
the Vāhlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the river
Indus.
So far as the literary evidence is concerned we find that
Bālhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda;^542 here
the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mūjavants, the
Mahāvṛṣas, and the Balhikas. The Mūjavants are quite certainly
a northern tribe, and though the passage may contain a pun
on Bālhika as suggesting ‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’),^543
still there is no doubt that the name was chosen from a northern
tribe.^544
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā^545 mentions a Kuru king named
Balhika Prātipīya. It seems that Balhika was a descendant of
Pratīpa. But there is no evidence to show why he bore the name
Balhika.^546 He is perhaps the same as Mahārāja Bāhlika Prātī-
peya of the Mahābhārata.^547
The Rāmāyaṇa shows that the Royal Kuru family originally
migrated from the Bāhlīka country. The passage in question^548
says that Ila, son of the Prajāpati Kardama, who was the king
of the Vāhli country, gave up Bahlika in favour of his son
Śaśavindu, and founded a new city Pratiṣṭhānapura in the
Madhya-deśa, where his other son Pururava Aila continued to
rule. This links up the Ailas, the progenitor of the Kurus, with
the Kardama royal family of Bāhli. H.C. Raychaudhuri^549
suggests that Kārddama, the name of the ruling family of
Vāhlika, was obtained from the river of that name in Persia,
and thus infers that the home of the Kārddama king is to
be identified with Bahlika or Balkh in Iran. This view was
earlier advocated by Roth^550 and Weber.^551 But Zimmer^552
rightly shows that there is no need to assume any Iranian
influence.^553
We know Vāhlīka from the Puranic list of peoples^554 The
Account of fifty-six countries^555 is interesting as it mentions
them with the Hūṇas, Kauravas, Gāndhāras and Vidarbhas
among others. In the Śaktisaṅgama Tantra^556 Bāhlīka is
described as famous for horses and situated to the east of
Mahāmlechha and beginning with Kamboja. B.C. Law on the
basis of reference in the Mahābhārata^557 places the Vāhlikas
in the neighbourhood of Gandhar and Kamboja.^558
Katyāyana (4th century B.C.)^559 mentions Bāhlāyana and
derives it from the word Bāhli, a country also mentioned in
the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya.^560
The Vāyu Purāṇa, Śiva Purāṇā, Kāvya-Mīmāṃsā of Rājaśe-
khara and the Rāmāyaṇa^561 place the Vāhlika country in the
northern division.^562 Bāhlika is the name of a person in the
Viṣṇu-Purāṇa.^563 The Nāṭyaśāstra^564 of Bharata says that
Bāhlikabhāṣā was spoken by the northern people (Udīcyas).
A similar reference is also to be found in the Sāhitya-darpaṇa.^565
In the Kāmasūtra of Vatsyāyana,^566 Bāhlīka is grouped
with Strīrājya, which occurs in the list of North-Western divi-
sion. The peculiar custom in Bāhlika of several young men
being married to a single woman as in strīrājya (strīrājye ca
Bāhlike...), appears to be an outlandish custom prevailing
in the regions to the west of India.^567 The Jayamaṅgalā comm-
entary also says that Bāhlīka was in Uttarāpatha.^568
We find the word Vāhlika occurring in the Amara-kośa in
two ways:

2. Bāhlīka^570
The Amarakośa shows that Bāhlīka was famous for horses,
saffron and Ferula Asafoetida (hiṅgu).
The reference to saffron leads us to the filaments of saffron
on the banks of Vaṅkṣu (oxus) where Raghu gave defeat to the
Hūṇas as described in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.^571 The reading
Sindhu of the passage^572 is plainly a mistake for Vaṅkśu which
is corroborated by Kṣīrasvāmin, the earliest commentator of
Amara who clearly shows that the Bāhlīka country was border-
ed on the Oxus.^573
The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^574 places Bāhlīkas in the jurisdiction of
the Sun. Ancient tradition connects the Bāhlikas with the
Dhārṣṭakas, a Kṣatriya clan which occupied the Bāhlīka
country.^575 We know that Bāhlīkī was another name of Mādrī,
queen of the Madras.^576
Buddha Prakash suggests that the Vedic school of the
Bhāllavins enshrined the memory of the Bāhlīkas; the modern
sub-castes of the Barasarin sub-group of the khatris Bhalla and
Behl represent the ancient Bālhīkas, and the Jāṭ clans of Bhālār
and Bhalerah, found in Multan, the Baloch tribe Bhalkā, liv-
ing in Sindh, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan and the clan
Bhallowana, found in Shahpur, are remnants of the far-flung
Bāhlika tribes.^577 There is a possibility of the Bāhlīkas migrat-
ing from their original home Balkh to the Punjab.^578
When Hieun Tsang visited Balkh, it was a centre of Buddh-
ist faith,^579 but after the overthrow of the Sassanid kingdom by
the Arabs, the ancient Bactria along with the adjoining territor-
ies passed under the control of Khorasan, the seat of the
Muhammadan power.^580

यौधेय
23. Yaudheya (No. 1, L. 22):
The Yaudheyas are included among the tribes subjugated by
Samudragupta. In his time, they seem to have occupied north-
ern Rajputana and south-east Punjab, and their territory
extended up to the confines of the Bahawalpur State where
their name survives in the name of the tract called Johiyawar.^581
Their earliest reference in the inscriptions is found in the
Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150)^582
which mentions the victory of Mahākṣatrapa Rudradāman over
the Yaudheyas who were ‘proud of their heroism’. The Bijaya-
gadh Inscription^583 which is a record of the Yaudheyas (in
Brāhmī characters of the second-third century A.D.)^584 connects
them with Bharatpur State in Rajputana. It refers to one
Mahārāja Mahāsenāpati, the ruler of the Yaudheya-gaṇa.^585
Literally the word Yaudheya means ‘a warrior’ which corr-
esponds with the Ossadü of Arrian, the Sambastae of Diodorus
and the Sambracae of Curtius, who made their submission to
Alexander.^586 They were a powerful nation and their forces
consisted of 60,000 foot, 6000 horse, and 500 chariots.^587
We get three different versions about the origin of the
Yaudheyas:
(i) In the Mahābhārata^588 it is stated that Yudhiṣṭhira
married the daughter of the Śaivya King Govāsana
named Devikā and begot a son from her named
Yaudheya.
Buddha Prakash^589 and M.K. Sharan,^590 on this basis,
have been tempted to connect the Yaudheyas with
Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest of the Pāṇḍava brothers. D.K.
Gupta questions the foundations of this theory on this
solitary basis in the absence of a more solid or a posi-
tive evidence;^591 but on the other hand he himself has
indulged in connecting the Ārjunāyanas with the epic
hero Arjuna.^592
(ii) The Viṣṇu-Purāṇa gives a contrary view of the same
story. It states that Yaudheyī was the queen of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira from whom he had a son named Devaka^593
(iii) The Harivaṃśa^594 and the Vāyu Purāṇa^595 state that
King Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty had five queens
named Nṛgā or Mṛgā, Kṛmī, Navā, Darvā and Dṛṣad-
vatī who gave birth to five sons named Nṛga, (or Mṛga),
Kṛmi, Nava, Suvrata and Śibi (or Śivi) respectively.
Śibi was the lord of the Śibi people or of the city of
Śivapura, while Nṛga (or Mṛga) was the ruler of the
Yodheyas or of Yaudheyapura. The other three sons
of Uśīnara, viz., Nava, Kṛmi and Suvrata, were the
lords respectively of Navarāṣṭra, Kṛmilāpurī and Amba-
ṣṭhapurī.^596 According to Pargiter, King Uśinara
established the Yaudheyas, Ambaṣṭhas, Navarāṣṭra, and
the city of Kṛmilā, all on the eastern border of the
Punjab; while his famous son Śivi Auśīnara originated
the Śivis or Śrbis in Sivapura.^597
It is very difficult to reject or accept the Puranic tradition
without any further evidence. However, as regards their conne-
ction with Uśīnara, we may say that scholars are somewhat
confused by differing versions by varied text with regard to the
territory ruled over by him.^598 The Ṛgveda, the Jātakas as
well as the accounts of Fahien and Hiuen Tsang connect the
Uśīnaras with a region farther to the north-west in Swat Valley,
a part of the ancient Mahājanapada of Gandhāra; while the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, the Kauśītakī Upaniṣad and the Kathāsa-
ritsāgara associate them to the region north of Haridwar near
the source of Ganges at Kanakhala.
It is possible that originally they were settled in the Swat
Valley but by the passage of time, they migrated to other places
as well. For example, we find that the Śibis were known to
Alexander's followers, living between the Indus and the
Akesines (Chenab).^599
In the Mahābhārata,^600 the Yaudheyas are described as
having been defeated by Arjuna, along with the Mālavas and
Trigarttas. In the Sabhāparvan,^601 the Yaudheyas together
with the Śibis and the Trigarttas are represented as having
paid homage to Yudhiṣṭhira. In the Droṇaparvan,^602 we find
that an epithet ‘Adrija’ meaning ‘mountain-born’, is used for
the Yaudheyas.
The Yaudheyas were one of the republican tribes of the
Punjab. Pāṇini^603 includes them among the āyudhajīvī saṃghas
together with the Parśus who are considered to be Persians
by Dr. Buddha Prakash.^604 Pāṇini mentions the Yaudheyas in
another Sūtra also.^605 Kauṭilya also refers to the Yaudheya as
a warrior clan of the Punjab.^606
The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^607 places them in the northern division of
India and describes them as being in the region of Bṛhaspati.^608
In the Sāhityadarpaṇa of Viśvanātha, they are described as
interested in gambling (dīvyatām) and speaking the Southern
Vaidarbhī.^609
Yaudheya coins have been found all over the area from
Saharanpur to Multan. In the Ludhiana district have been
unearthed their votive tablets. A rich find of their coin-moulds
was brought to light by B. Sahni at Khokrakot near Rohtak
where there seems to have existed a regular mint.^610 Their
new currency^611 depicting their tutelary deity Kārttikeya which
replaced the Kuṣāṇa currency in these regions, shows that
they played a leading part in the extermination of Śaka rule
in India.^612 The findings of the Yaudheya coins in large num-
ber at Saharanpur, Dehradoon, Delhi, Rohtak and Kangra
attest the fact that they had driven out the Kuṣāṇas from these
areas and had re-established themselves firmly, in the 3rd-4th
century A.D.^613
One of their seals, bearing the legend “Yaudheyānām jayam-
antradharāṇām”^614 shows that they were held in high esteem
among the warrior-clans of the Punjab. Some scholars seem
to be confused about its interpretation. Shobha Mukerji^615
opines that their coins were issued in the name of the gaṇa as
well as the Mantra-dharas. M.K. Sharan^616 explains the word
“Mantradhara” to mean the members of the Executive Com-
mittee “those vested with the policy of the state”. He is of the
opinion that one set of the Yaudheya coins is struck in the
name of the “Mantradharas” and the “Gaṇa”, while the other
set is struck simply in the name of Gaṇa.^617 He seems to have
wrongly substituted the reading “Mantradhāra” for “Mantra-
dhara”. He has been arbitrary in separating “Jaya” from
Mantradharāṇām”^618 which forms a compound by the combi-
nation of the two words. Further he rejects the view of some
historians who consider the word “Mantradharāṇām” to mean
‘those who were in possession of Victory Charm’. But he
contradicts himself at another place while explaining a seal^619
found at Naurangabad with the remarks: “This seal indicates
the bravery of the tribe and that they were never defeated as
they had adopted the title of ‘जयमन्त्रधराः’”.
Actually the expression may mean ‘the Yaudheyas who
knew the secret of victory’. It is symbolic of their victory and
pride that they never got defeated.
Another word which has raised some controversy among
the scholars is “Darma” found on some of the Yaudheya coins.
Some scholars take it to mean Dharma while others take it for
‘Dama’ or ‘Darma’ to be a Sanskritised form of Greek —
“Drachma”.^620 Again some controversy arose whether it was
a Copper one or of silver.^621 The word ‘Damma’ or ‘Dramma’
has been used for a gold coin.^622 It may be remarked that the
word borrowed from some foreign language may not strictly
be used in the original sense and hence it may simply mean
coin.^623 The Kuṣāṇas had introduced gold-coins which were
later on adopted by the Guptas. But the Yaudheyas seem to
have never adopted the gold currency since so far we have found
no gold coin belonging to them. This may speak of their weaker
economic condition; surely they could not compare with
powerful monarchies. On some of the Yaudheya coins, we have
the mysterious words, “dvi” (two) and “tri” (three) after the
legend “Yaudheyagaṇasya jayaḥ” which may point out their
making a confederation with other tribes, viz., the Ārjunāyanas
and the Kuṇindas.^624 They seem to have controlled the area
lying on the banks of the river Sutlej up to the borders of the
Bahawalpur State which is still called Johiyawar. The word
‘Johiya’ is apparently an abbreviation of ‘Jodhiya’, which is the
Sanskrit Yaudheya.^625 Cunningham, however, takes the words
‘dvi’ and ‘tri’ of the above-mentioned coins to signify ‘the
money of the second and third tribes of the Yaudheyas’.^626
M.K. Sharan^627 has enlisted about twenty-four types and
Symbols on the coins of the Yaudheyas which may point to
their religious leanings as well bear out some aspects of their
social life. They are as follows:
1. Bull
2. Elephant
3. Deer
4. Peacock
5. Tree-in-railing
6. Human figure standing (warrior)
7. Lakṣmī
8. Cobra
9. Scythic-like object (Yūpa)
10. Stūpa
11. Triśūla
12. Nandipada
13. Shell
14. Svastika
15. Vase or Maṅgala Kalaśa
16. Tribal sign or Ujjayinī Symbol
17. Two ‘s’ with a line in between probably representing
two hooded snakes
18. Triangular-headed symbol or more probably a Yūpa
19. Zig-Zag line depicting snake or river
20. Circles with dots around, probably representing the sun
21. Curved object within railing, probably a representation
of the Yūpa
22. Hill so-called Caitya
23. Six-headed Ṣaṣṭhī or Kṛttikā^628
24. Śiva.

राष्ट्र
 Rāṣṭra^1 (from §rāj):
It is the oldest and biggest territorial term. In the Ṛgveda^2
and later Saṃhitās,^3 it denotes ‘kingdom’ or ‘royal territory’.
It is considered to be one of the Prakṛtis (constituents)^4 and
refers to a country.^5 It was the name of a Commissioner's
division under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas.^6 In South India, under the
Pallavas, Kadambas, and Sālaṅkāyanas also it denotes only
a district, if not a tehsil.^7 The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra^8 says
that ‘all the rāṣṭra including nagara is called deśa or maṇḍala
while nagara is excluded in janapada’.
It divides rāṣṭras into three kinds: —
(i) Big: It consists of nine thousand and ninety villages,
but some scholars say that the nine thousand and sixty
four villages make a big rāṣṭra.^9
(ii) Middle: It consists of five thousand, three hundred and
eighty four villages.^10
(iii) Small: It consists of one thousand, five hundred and
forty eight villages.^11
It further discusses that seven cities should be established
in each rāṣṭra.^12
In place-names rāṣṭra is changed into:^13
(a) Rāṭhā, as Mahārāṣṭra, Marāṭhā
(b) Rāṭ, at Mayarāṣṭra, (= Mayarāṭ), Mirāṭ
It also changes into raṭṭa,
Cf. Nāgiraṭṭa. Walde also derives it
from §rāj-(n. sg. rāṭ)
Sk. rāṣṭra: AV. rāstar — ,^14
In ancient Indian history extending over several centuries,
we do not find uniformity in the nomenclature of the different
territorial and administrative divisions in the various kingdoms
flourishing in different centuries and provinces. In the small
kingdoms like those of the Pallavas, the Vākāṭakas and
Gāhaḍavālas we usually find reference to only one territorial
division, the district variously called viṣaya or rāṣṭra.^15

देवराष्ट्र
1. Devarāṣṭra (No. 1, L. 20):
It has been mentioned as ruled by Kubera one of the kings
ruling in Southern Region who were subdued by Samudragupta.
Dey^16 identifies it with the Maratha country (i. e. Mahārāṣṭra).
Fleet and Smith are also of the same opinion. G. Ramdas
slightly differs from them when he identifies Devarāṣṭra with
modern Devagiri in the Dharwar district.^17 According to R.D.
Banerjee^18 Devarāṣṭra is the name of a district or province in
Kaliṅga. B.C. Law^19 identifies it with Yellowmanchili taluka of
the Vizagapatam district, which is also the view of H.C. Ray-
chaudhuri,^20 S.B. Chaudhuri,^21 Dubreuil and Bhandarkar.^22 This
view is generally accepted at present. Earlier scholars held that
Samudragupta made a round of the South crossing from the
eastern to the western coast of India. But this involves serious
difficulties about his potential relations with the Vākāṭakas.
Now, scholars describe southern campaign of Samudragupta
as confined to the eastern coast. Thus it becomes apparent
that Devarāṣṭra was conterminous with Kośala (Sirpur). Tām-
ralipti may have been included in Devarāṣṭra.^23
2. Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa (No 28, L. 2, L. 8, L. 15):
L. 2 of the inscription mentions a maṇḍala (sub-division) called
Nāgiraṭṭa (Nāgiraṭṭa-māṇḍalika) and later on refers to Mūla-
Nāgiraṭṭa which seems to have been the headquarters of this
maṇḍala. It is clear from the inscription itself that Mūla-
Nāgiraṭṭa was situated in the neighbourhood of Nitva-Gohālī.^24
Mūla-Nāgiraṭṭa literally means ‘Nāgiraṭṭa Proper’. The
word Nāgiraṭṭa is the Prakritic form of Nāgarāṣṭra meaning ‘a
country of the Nāgas’.

सुराष्ट्र
3. Surāṣṭra (No. 14, L. 8, L. 9):
In L. 8 Surāṣṭra is used in plural^25 while in L. 9 it is an adjective
of avani (land).^26 In this inscription great importance has been
attached to Surāṣṭra. After his conquests, Skandagupta
deliberated for days and nights together as to whom should be
entrusted important task of guarding the land of the Surāṣṭras.^27
At last he was satisfied by appointing Parṇadatta as a governor
over this western^28 region.
Surāṣṭra corresponds with Southern Kathiawar with its
Prakrit name Soraṭh.^29 Literally the name means a good
country. It was so named probably on account of the natural
fertility of the land, Soraṭh is well known for rich crops of all
kinds, and splendid cattle.^30
Surāṣṭra^31 is mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription
of Rudradāman I (A.D. 150). It was governed by Puṣyagupta,
under Candragupta Maurya and by a Yavana Tuṣāspa under
Aśoka.^32 The Purāṇas^33 and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā^34 mention it
a country in the west while the Bṛhatsaṃhitā^35 mentions it
as a country in the South. It may be due to the different
geographical units made by the authors of the Kāvyamīmāṃsā
and the Bṛhatsaṃhitā.
Under Gupta emperors Bāmanasthalī (modern Banthali) was
the capital of Surāṣṭra, before Valabhī became its capital.^36
The name Surāṣṭra also occurs in the Mahābhārata, the
Jātakas^37, and several times in the Rāmāyaṇa.^38 It is also
mentioned in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.^39 In Kauṭilya's Arthaśās-
tra, Surāṣṭras are mentioned as one of the corporations of
warriors who lived by agriculture and trade.^40 According to
the Arthaśāstra the elephants of Surāṣṭra were inferior to those
belonging to Aṅga and Kaliṅga.^41
In the medieval period,^42 in three directions, Bhavanagar,
Porabandar and Somanath (the famous temple) were the limits
of Surāṣṭra.

भुक्ति
 Bhukti (from §bhuj)
Literally it means ‘enjoyment’ or possession.^43 Bhukti
denoted an administrative division smaller than a modern
Tehsil or Taluka in the Deccan and M.P., but in Northern
India under the Guptas and Pratihāras it denoted a unit as
large as the Commissioner's Division in modern times.^44 Thus
Pratiṣṭhānabhukti consisted of only 12 and Koppārakabhukti
of 50 villages in the Deccan under the Rāṣṭrakūṭas,^45 whereas
under the Guptas the Puṇḍravardhanabhukti comprised of the
districts of Dinajpur, Bogra and Rajshahi, and Magadhabhukti
included the districts of Gayā and Pāṭaliputra.^46 Śrāvastibhukti
under the Pratihāras included several districts in northern
U.P.^47 The Bhuktis under the Pratihāra empire appear to have
been rather Commissioners' Divisions than provinces.^48 Bhukti
is changed into huti as Jejakabhukti, Jejahuti.^49 The unit bhukti
which so often appears in the inscriptions of the Gupta period
as the designation of an administrative unit is not frequently
found in the early medieval period.^50 The mention of a
Nagara-bhukti is also made in Deo-Baranark Inscription of
Jīvitagupta II.^51
We find only one place name with the suffix bhukti which
is detailed below:
Puṇḍravardhana (No. 28, L. 1; No. 33, LL. 1-2; No. 34,
L. 2; No. 35, L. 2; No. 36, L. 2; No. 37, L. 2; No. 43,
L. 14):
This bhukti is mentioned in the Gupta epigraphs ranging
from the years 124 to 224 of the Gupta era, i. e. from A.D. 443
to 543. It formed an integral part of Gupta empire during this
period. According to Inscription No. 37, a noble man (kula-
putra) Amṛtadeva by name belonging to Ayodhyā approached
the local government of Koṭivarṣa of which Svyambhudeva
was the governor, under the provincial government of Puṇḍra-
vardhana-bhukti, during the reign of Bhānugupta, and prayed
that he might be given, by means of a copper-plate document
in accordance with the prevailing custom, some rent-free
waste lands. His prayer was granted.
General Cunningham^52 identifies Puṇḍravardhana with the
extensive ruins known as ‘Mahāsthāngarh’, 8 miles north of
the town of Bogra. The river Karatoyā was the dividing line
between Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti and Kāmarūpa.^53 According
to Wilson, the ancient kingdom of Puṇḍradeśa included the
districts of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Malda, Bogra and
Tirhut.^54 It seems to have been the biggest administrative
division or province of the Gupta empire, divided into several
viṣayas and maṇḍalas of which twenty-four^55 are mentioned
in known epigraphs. In short Puṇḍravardhana signified North
Bengal.
Puṇḍravardhana, as the name suggests, was a settlement of
the Puṇḍras.^56 The first reference to the Puṇḍras is found in
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.^57 The earliest literary reference to
Puṇḍravardhana is to be traced in the Buddhist work, the
Divyāvadāna, where it is mentioned as the easternmost city of
India.^58 The Pauṇḍra country is mentioned also in the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā,^59 as situated in the east.^60 The Kāvyamīṃāṃsā also
mentions it as a Janapada in the east. In the inscriptions of
Bengal the name Puṇḍravardhana was changed into Pauṇḍra-
vardhana in the early part of the 12th century, when it occurs
first in the Manahali grant of Madanapāla and remained in use
till the end of the Sena rule. The Rājataraṅgiṇī mentions
Puṇḍravardhana as the capital of Gauḍa which is also proved
by a reference in Puruṣottama's lexicon (11th century A.D.)^61
The city lost its importance from the third quarter of the
12th century A.D. as the later Sena kings shifted their capital
to Gauḍa in the Malda district. Towards the end of the 13th
or the beginning of the 14th century A.D. Puṇḍravardhana was
occupied by the Muhammedans.^62

विषय
 Viṣaya
According to Monier Williams it means a dominion, king-
dom, territory, region, district, country, or abode and in plural
it meant lands or possessions.^63 In the Aṣṭādhyāyī^64 it denotes
regions or provinces, called after their inhabitants, e. g. Śaiba,
the region of the Śibis; Mālavaka, the region of the Mālava
people; Rājanyaka, of the Rājanya tribe and so forth. ‘The
names according to Viṣaya seem to be based on the ethnic
distribution of population over particular areas for the time
being without reference to the form of government’.^65
The word Viṣaya in the sūtra Viṣayo deśe^66 is significant.
Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana and Hemacandra take it as rāṣṭra, and
Vardhamāna as Janapada. The Kāśikā takes it as grāma-samu-
dāya. Kātayāyana and Patañjali interpret Viṣaya as being
identical with janapada in some cases, but their comments
give the impression that even such geographical units as were
not a janapada were called Viṣaya.^67
If Viṣaya and Janapada had been identical, Pāṇini would
not have treated the former under a separate heading.^68 A
Viṣaya denoted both a bigger unit having the status of a
Janapada, and a smaller area which was but an estate. In the
Rājanyādi gaṇa, viṣaya denotes janapadas, while in the
Bhauriki and Aiṣukāri gaṇas,^69 it is landed property, the share
of estate which was the source of livelihood.
In the post-pāṇinian period, distinction between Janapada
and viṣaya was lost, both being called by the same names, for
example Aṅgāḥ, Vangāḥ, Sumhāḥ, and Puṇḍrāḥ. In some Jana-
padas like Rājanya, the distinction was retained, as Rājanyaka
denoted a viṣaya and Rājanyāḥ, the Janapada of the Rājanya
tribe. Similarly we have Vāsātaḥ, Vāsātayaḥ; Gandhāraḥ,
Gāndhārayaḥ; and Śaibaḥ, Śibiyaḥ. Other smaller units were
only viṣayas or estates like Bailvavanaka, Ātmakāmeyaka,
Bhaurikavidha and Aiṣukāri-bhakta.^70
The viṣaya usually corresponded with the district of the
modern administration.^71 Minor bhuktis, maṇḍalas and the
viṣayas were used to denote the same administrative division
in many cases.^72 The district administration was well organised
in the Gupta period. Some of the land-grant charters bear the
seals of the district administration.^73 Sealings of the district
administration of Rājagṛha and Gayā have been found at
Nālandā, showing that their correspondence to outsiders bore
the impress of their official seals.^74

गया
1. Gayā (No. 21, L. 7):
A village named Revatikā belonging to the Gayā viṣaya
was granted as an agrahāra to a brāhmaṇa, ostensibly by
Samudragupta.^75 Gayā is at present headquarters of the
Gayā district, 60 miles due south of Patna. It comprises the
modern town of Sahebganj on the northern side and the
ancient town of Gayā on the southern side.^76 Much has been
written on Gayā,^77 all of which is not possible to discuss
here. We will confine ourselves to the origin of the name Gayā
and the importance of Gayā.
In the Ṛgveda Gaya is a proper name applied to a com-
poser of hymns.^78 In the Atharvaveda^79 Gaya appears to be a
wonder-worder or sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa who
later on transformed himself into Gayāsura.^80 According to
the Vāyu Purāṇa,^81 the city was named Gaya after an Asura,
Gaya by name (Gayāsura). Viṣṇu killed this demon but
granted him a boon that this city would be held highly sacred.
According to R.L. Mitra,^82 this story is an allegorical repre-
sentation of the expulsion of Buddhism from Gayā which
was the headquarters of the Buddhist faith. Aurṇavābha in ex-
plaining ‘idam Viṣṇur-vī Cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam’^83
in the Nirukta^84 holds that the three steps of Viṣṇu were placed
on Samārohaṇa, Viṣṇupada and Gayaśiras. The Māhabhārata
(III. 95 and VII. 64) describes the performance of sacrifices by
Gaya^85 references to which^86 are also found in the Rāmā-
yaṇa,^87 Bhāgavata Purāṇa^88 Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa,^89 Agni
Purāṇa,^90 Viṣṇu Purāṇa,^91 Vāmana Purāṇa,^92 etc. Aśvaghoṣa's
Buddhacarita^93 (I or II cent. A.D.) speaks of the Buddha's
visit to the hermitage called ‘the city of the royal sage Gaya’,
who was later conceived as a great giant.^94
We can find evidence of the importance of Gayā growing
in the period subsequent to A.D. 750. At Gayā while we have
only one inscription belonging to the Gupta period, we get
numerous inscriptions belonging to the Pāla period.^95 But
these records are of not much use for the history of the town,
they simply show that till the end of the twelfth century A.D.
it was under the Pālas.^96
The city played no major role in polities at any period of
history but it was certainly a centre of religious movements of
Buddhist and the Brahmanical Hindus.^97 Gayā which was the
headquarters of Buddhist faith passed to the Hindus between
the second and fourth centuries of the Christian era and by
A.D. 637 when Hiuen Tsang visited the city it had become a
thriving centre of Hindu Brahmanical religion.^98
The religious importance of Gayā is met with in the Māhā-
bhārata,^99 Rāmāyaṇa^100 and Purāṇas.^101 The Gayā has a
special religious importance with reference to the Śrāddha cere-
mony.^102

2. Khād(ṭā)pāra^103 (No. 29, L. 7):
The inscription came from a place Dhanaidaha in the Natore
subdivision of the Rajashahi district (in Puṇḍravardhana).^104
So this viṣaya may be assigned to the Puṇḍravardhana bhukti.
The name of the district cannot be read with certainty. Sen^105
suggests three readings: Mahā-Khushāpāra, Khādā(ṭā) pāra, or
Khusaspāra. Banerji gives the reading ‘Mahā-khuṣāpāra.^106

कोटिवर्ष
3. Koṭivarṣa (No. 34, L. 3; No. 35, L. 3; No. 36, L. 3; No. 37, L. 3):
It has been described as a viṣaya under Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti.
This reference clearly shows that the size of a viṣaya was small-
er than that of a bhukti. The viṣaya of Koṭivarṣa occurs frequ-
ently in the epigraphic records of the Pālas and Senas.^107 It
seems to have comprised the southern part of the Dinajpur
district, the northern portion of Rajashahi and probably also
the eastern tracts of the Bogra district.^108 Its head-quarters was
Diw-kot (Devakoṭa or Devīkoṭa).^109 Yādavaprakāśa identifies
Koṭivarṣa with Devīkoṭṭa.^110 The Vāyu Purāṇa also refers to a
city of the name of Koṭivarṣa.^111
The Prakrit lexicon Pāia-sadda-mahaṇṇavo describes it as
the capital of Lāṭa country.^112 The name is known to the Jain
Prajñāpanā in which it is placed in Lāḍha or Lāṭa.^113
Hemacandra^114 says that Koṭivarṣa, Bāṇapura, Devīkoṭa,
Umāvana and Śoṇitapura are identical. Puruṣottama^115 agrees
with Hemacandra with the only difference that he mentions
Uṣāvana in place of Umāvana. Bāṇapura is represented by
Bāngarh in the Dinajpur district, which still preserves the exten-
sive ruins of a citadel known as Damdamaḥ said to have been
the fort of Devīkoṭa associated with the exploits of the mythi-
cal king Bāṇa.^116 Diw-koṭa or Devīkoṭa (wrongly read as Dihi-
kota in the A-In-i-Akbarī) was a mahal under the Sarkar of
Lakhnautī (Lakṣaṇavatī).^117
The termination varṣa is significant. It denotes a division
of the earth as separated off by mountain ranges.^118 From the
Purāṇas we know of such names as Harivarṣa, Kiṃpuruṣa-
Varṣa and Bhārata-Varṣa.^119 Varṣam in Pāṇini^120 means the
rainy season. We know that rains are connected with the moun-
tains. So originally the divisions might have been made accord-
ing to the rains in different areas. Rains being very important
for agriculture affect the inhabitants of a certain area through-
out the year. Later on the semantic development of the word
came to denote a year. In India the seasons have been regard-
ed to be important and hence they had often been used to
denote the year.^121

कृमिला
4. Kṛmilā (No. 40, L. 5):
The Viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā also spelt as Krimilā is mention-
ed in inscription No. 40. According to D.C. Sircar “as the
charter is spurious and seems to have been forged a few centu-
ries after Samudragupta's time, it may or may not prove the
existence of a viṣaya and therefore of a city of the above name
in the fourth century.^122 But certain old seals found at Nālandā
prove the existence of Kṛmilā before the Pāla occupation of
Bihar.^123 The village Kavāla in the Krimilāviṣaya known from
one such seal can be identified with modern Kawāli not far
from Valgūdar.^124 The viṣaya or district of Kṛmilā is also men-
tioned in the records of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar.^125
According to a tradition recorded in the Harivaṃśa,^126
Vayu Purāṇa^127 and the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa^128 Kṛmi, the son
of king Uśīnara of the Puru dynasty, born of his second queen
Kṛmi, was the lord of Kṛmilāpurī.^129
In the Buddhist literature, we get various forms for the city
of Kṛmilā: Kimilā, Kimmilā and Kimbilā. The name of an
inhabitant of the city is given as Kimila, Kimmilā or Kimbilā.
Malālasekera^130 recognises the spellings Kimilā or Kimbilā and
Kimila or Kimbila, but prefers the forms Kimbilā and Kimbilā.
Kimilā can be the Pali form of Sanskrit Kṛmilā (or Krimilā),
and Kimmilā can be derived from the other Sanskrit variant
Kirmilā.^131 Two Suttas, the Kimilāsutta and Kimilasutta, were
preached by the Buddha when he was camping at the city of
Kimilā (Kṛmilā) said to have been situated on the bank of the
Gaṅgā. The river is now at a short distance from the villages
of Valgūdar and Rajauna, on the site of which the ancient city
stood.^132
M.S. Pandey^133 opposes the identification of Kṛmilā with
Valgūdar on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence
to prove this identification. Though Kṛmilā is not referred to
in early Pali literature, we find a city named Kṛmilā mention-
ed in the Aṅguttara Nikāya Commentary.^134 According to this
commentary, the city stood on the bank of the Gaṅgā. But
now-a-days, the Gaṅgā flows at some distance from this region
which may be due to a change in the course of the river dur-
ing so many centuries. The city was not very important and
may have gradually disappeared. At present we do not find
any traces of the city: it may have been washed away by the
Gaṅgā. According to Pandey^135 the name of the modern villa-
ge Kiul has some resemblance with the name Kṛmilā and it is
not unlikely that the city may have been somewhere in that
locality.
Sircar is himself not sure about the identification of Kṛmilā
with Valgūdar^136 and seems to prefer the claim of modern
Kawali not being far from Valgūdar Kṛmilā.^137 But in the
district Gazetteer of Monghyr it is the village of Kiul which
is mentioned and not Kawali. Hence we prefer the view of
Dr. Pandey.
The word Kṛmilā means “a fruitful woman” or “a place
full of worms” and the word Kṛmi forming its first part is
sometimes also written as Krimi.^138

लाट
5. Lāṭa^139 (No. 17, L. 3)
The district or viṣaya of Lāṭa is here described as “pleasing
with choice trees that are bowed down by the weight of (their)
flowers, and with temples and assembly-halls of the gods, and
with vihāras, (and) the mountains of which are covered over
with vegetation”.
The country south of Mahī or at times south of the Nar-
badā up to the Pūrva or so far as Daman, was called Lāṭa and
‘it corresponded roughly with Southern Gujarat’.^140 It comp-
rised the collectorates of Surat, Bharoch, Kheda and parts of
Baroda territory.^141
According to Prof. Bühler, Lāṭa is Central Gujarat, the
district between the Mahī and Kim rivers and its chief city was
Broach.^142 Lāṭa has been identified with Central and Southern
Gujarat in the Rewah Stone Inscription of Karṇa.^143 We also
find the Lāṭa kingdom mentioned in other epigraphical reco-
rds.^144 Lāṭarāṣṭra^145 is identical with the old Lāṭa kingdom of
Gujarat, the capital city of which is stated in the Dīpavaṃśa to
have been Siṃapura (Sīhapura).^146 In the early days of the
imperial Guptas, the Lāṭa country was formed into an admini-
strative province in the Lāṭaviṣaya.^147 The Śaktisaṅgam Tantra
places the Lāṭa country to the west of Avanti and to the north-
west of Vidarbha.^148
Lāṭa is the same as the Larike of Ptolemy which lay to the
east of Indo-Scythia along the sea-coast.^149 The word Lāṭa is
derived from Sanskrit Rāṣṭra.^150 The Nāgara brāhmaṇas of
Lāṭa (Gujarat) are said to have invented the Nāgarī character
which is believed to have been derived from the Brāhmī alpha-
bet.^151

वैव्य
6. Vaivya^152 (No. 40, L. 4):
In this inscription the viṣaya of Vaivya is mentioned. The word
Vaivya is inexplicable. We may, however, suggest that the term
was possibly derived from Prakrit Vevva^153 which means ‘fear’
and hence Vaivya would mean ‘fearful’ or ‘dreadful’.

मण्डल
 Maṇḍala
Maṇḍala is a territorial unit which is found in the inscriptions
of many dynasties of the early medieval period. Originally it
denoted in the Arthaśāstra and other legal texts,^154 a diploma-
tic circle of twelve neighbouring kings, some friendly and
others unfriendly, in relation to a king desirous of conquest.
The term could also be used for the territory under the posse-
ssion of a feudatory. But in the Gupta period maṇḍala is used
for some kind of administrative division though in early medie-
val period its use was in feudalistic association.^155 In Cālukyan
records, the governor of a maṇḍala was usually called a Maṇḍ-
aleśvara or Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara.^156 In the records of the Impe-
rial Guptas it denoted a unit smaller than a Vīthī.^157 Literally
meaning a circle or round it denotes a district, province, coun-
try in general or it may signify a surrounding district or neigh-
bouring state.^158

ऐरिकिण
 Airikiṇa (No. 2, L. 25):
It has been described here as the bhoga-nagara of the king (sva-
bhoga-nagara).^164 In this context the use of the phrase ‘Sva-
bhoganagara’ is important. K.P. Jayaswal^165 interprets ‘sva bho-
ganagara’ as a town that had, since the victory scored by the
Gupta king at Eraṇ, become his direct personal possession.
Fleet translates it as ‘the city of his own enjoyment’.^166
Daśaratha Sharma^167 explains it as analogous to the word
‘Ekabhoga’ defined in the Mānasāra as a town or village inha-
bited by a single land-holder along with his dependants.^168 It
is ‘Svabhoga’ for the master and ‘Ekabhoga’ for others’. Sharma
connects this ‘Svabhoga’ with a feudatory ‘who lived therein
with his family and dependants, and on whom Samudragupta,
pleased by his ‘devotion’, policy, and valour’ conferred the title
of Rājan and the accompanying glories of consecration, etc.
described in verse 4.^169 But Sharma seems to be incorrect in
associating the inscription with a feudatory, the inscription
belongs to Samudragupta himself which is clear by further
description in subsequent verses.^170 No doubt in the Eraṇ
Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa^171 the word ‘sva-viṣaya’
an adjectival clause of Airikiṇa is used to refer to a feudatory,
which is very clear from the inscription.
The editor^172 also, following Sharma, is misled and ex-
plains the term ‘Svabhoga’ as implying a grant, or something
like it by the governor of the province, who had for his own
salary the revenues of the city of Airikiṇa allotted to him.^173
But the term ‘Svabhoganagara’ is significant in connoting royal
status, higher than that of a feudatory chief and can mean
‘the capital city’ where the king himself was residing. In con-
trast, in the Earṇ Stone Boar Inscription of Toramāṇa^174 the
term ‘Sva-viṣaya’ has been used for the feudatory Dhanyaviṣṇu
(of king Toramāṇa) who may have been a viṣayapati, the ad-
ministrator-incharge of Eraṇ.
Airikiṇa is the same as modern Eraṇ, the ancient Airikiṇa,
a village on the left bank of the Bina, in Sagar District of
Madhya Pradesh. From the Copper Coins of the Aśokan
period found at Eraṇ, we get an earlier Pali or Prakrit form
of the name which is Erakaña or Erakana or Erakaṇa.^175 It
is thus clear that Erakaña or Erakaṇa is the simplified form of
Erikiṇa: to simplify still more the medial letter ‘k’ has been
dropped by the process of elision.^176 The meaning of the word
Erikiṇa is a puzzle but its connexion with erakā ‘a kind of
grass,^177 found in that area may be accepted as a hypothesis.

‘land’.

पथ
 Patha (footpath)
‘Patha’ in Zend. The sanskrit spelling (th) is loaned from
Iran. Greek relatives are patos (path) and pontos (mariners'
path, sea-route: sea). Initial p is dropped in old Irish:
pathin (path) and pons (bridge) recur as ath (ford)’. Russian
pant (path) and pent (ford).^191
Monier Williams derives it from §panth to go, to move.
It means a way, path, a road or route.^192 In the Samarāṅga-
ṇasūtradhāra^193 we find the word ‘Jaṅghā-patha (foot-path)’.
The suffix ‘patha’ has been used as early as the later Vedic
period.^194 Originally patha meant ‘a path’, ‘a road’ but later on
it came to denote ‘a country’. Even now-a-days, the suffix
‘road’ is used for inhabitations and localities.

of the north were conquered by Samudragupta who attained
great fame by liberating them.^196 The kingdoms specifically
named as included in the southern region are: Kosala, Mahā-
kāntāra, Kurāḷa, Piṣṭapura, Koṭṭūra, Eraṇḍapalla, Kāñcī,
Avamukta, Veṅgī, Palakka, Devarāṣṭra and Kusthalapura.^197
“The earliest epigraphical mention of the Dakṣiṇāpatha is
found in the Nānāghaṭ Cave Inscription (Second half of first
Century B.C.)^198 It later appears in the Junāgaṛh Rock In-
scription of Rudradāman (A.D. 150)^199 as also in the Nasik
Cave Inscription of Vāsiṣṭhīputra Pulumāvi (A.D. 149).^200
Literally it means ‘the path or road leading to the south’ and
in short the ‘south country’. As a designation of the Deccan,^201
the term is found as early as the Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra.^202
A similar expression is Dakṣiṇā padā, ‘with southward foot’,
occurring in the Ṛgveda,^203 and refers to the place to which
exiles are expelled.^204 Thus the term denoted ‘South’ beyond
the limits of the recognised Āryan world.
In the Buddhist literature originally the name seems to
have been restricted to a remote settlement on the Upper
Godāvarī.^205 Some hold that it was situated to the south of
the Narbadā and was identical with the Dakhinabades of the
Greeks.^206

of the country to the south of the Vindhyas and includes
Pāṇḍya, Kuntala, Cola, Mahārāṣṭra, Kerala, Kulya, Setuja,

Thus we see that Dakṣiṇāpatha in later times came to
represent more or less the whole of the south.

पुर्
 Pur or Pura
Pur is a word of frequent occurrence in the Ṛgveda.^209 The
early Vedic Āryans were not city builders. Puras^210 which are
mentioned from the context seem to have been always associ-
ated with the dasyus and the enemies of the Āryans.^211 Pura,
the oldest Sanskrit word denoting city, is usually derived from
the Dravidian ur. From what we read in the Ṛgveda about
Puraṃdara's exploits in connection with the destruction of
the ninety-nine puras of the Asuras who had been causing
havoc to the gods, these puras seem to refer to the cities of
the Indus Valley pre-Āryans.^212 But the word ur is not availa-
ble in Dravidian lexicons: on the contrary it is pura which is
mentioned by them.^213 The word ur is not to be traced in the
I. E. languages.^214 We find Ur only as the name of a town in
Babylonia.^215 In Tamil country, in the inscriptions of the
Chola dynasty (A.D. 900-1300) the word ‘ur’ is used to
refer to ‘The Primary Assembly of the villagers’ in the case of
ordinary villages while in the same context the word Sabhā is
used in case of Agrahāra villages, mostly tenanted by learned
brāhmaṇas.^216
In the later Vedic literature^217 the word Pur meant ‘rampart’,
‘fort’, or ‘stronghold’. The meaning of Pura as ‘city’ developed
later and was not at all in vogue in the Vedic literature.
Lexicons define it as a place containing large buildings
surrounded by a ditch and extending not less than one Kośa in
length, if it extends for half that distance it is called a kheṭa;
if less than that, a karvaṭa or small market town, any smaller
cluster of houses is called a grāma or village.^218 The Sama-
rāṅgaṇasūtradhāra describes puras as being of three kinds —
Big, middle and small which have different measurements for
their ditches, buildings, streets and road-ways.^219 The big one
possesses a circumference of four thousand arcs, the middle of
two thousand arcs and the small of one thousand arcs.^220
T. Burrow derives pura from §pri to fill Piparti ‘fills’: pur ‘city’:
Lithuanian pilis (l becomes r).^221 We find the word being spelt
in two ways pur^222 and pura^223 Pur (city), from puru (much)
and pūrṇa (full) means ‘plentitude’ or multitude of settlers.
Similarly Greek polis (city) from poly (much): Latin populus
(population, people) from plenus (full), and English folk from
full. Pur is the city and puruṣa the citizen. Greek polites
(citizens), is preserved in politics (civic concerns), police (city
administration), and cosmopolitan (citizen of the world):
Lithuanian pilis (fort, castle).^224 In modern times the word
purā (from pura) is used for mohalla in India. It seems to be
the result of Muslim contact.^225
Pura, where it does not retain the original from pur, is
changed into the following^226:
(a) Wār: as Purushapura, Peshawar; Nalapura, Narwar;
Matipura, Madwār; Śalwapura, Alwar; Candrapura,
Candwar.
(b) Urs or ur, as Māyāpura, Mayura; Siṃhapura, Siṅgur;
Juṣkapura, Zukur
(c) Or, as Traipura, Tcor; Candrādityapura, Caindor
(d) Ora, as Ilbalapura, Ellora
(e) Ore, as Lavapura, Lahore
(f) Ola, as Āryapura, Aihole
(g) ar, as Kusumapura, Kumrār
(h) aur, as Siddhapura, Siddhaur
(i) Own, as Hiraṇyapura, Hindoun or Herdoun
There are many names with the suffix Pura in the Aṣṭā-
dhyāyī, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya and the Kāśikā.^227 The word
Mahāpura in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās^228 and the Brāhmaṇas^229
denotes a great fortress. Probably the only difference between
the Pur and Mahāpura was in their size.^230
Following are the place-names ending in the suffix pura:

अजपुर
(1) Ajapura (No. 12, L. 25):
In Inscription No. 12, we find the mention of the town of Aja-
pura. The name of the viṣaya of which it was a part has been
damaged. Since the column bearing the inscription was origi-
nally found in front of the northern gate of the odl fort of
Bihar,^231 we can easily identify Ajapura with the modern vill-
age of the same name in the Rājagṛha viṣaya which is not very
far from Nālandā.^232 The name of the viṣaya which included
this town can possibly be restored as Rājagṛha in the damaged
part of the inscription.

दशपुर
(3) Daśapura (No. 17, L. 4, L. 16):
In this inscription L. 4 refers to the migration of a guild of silk-
weavers from Lāṭa viṣaya (Central and Southern Gujarat) to
the city of Daśapura. The guild came to this city attracted by
the virtues of its kings.^234 The inscription refers itself to the
reign of king Kumāragupta, under whom Bandhuvarman, the
son of Viśvavarman^235 was the governor at Daśapura. L. 16 of
the inscription records that it was under the governorship of
Bandhuvarman (in Mālava era 493 = A.D. 437)^236, that a lofty
temple of the Sun-god was caused to be built by the guild of
silk-cloth weavers at Daśapura.^237 Afterwards, under other
kings, part of this temple fell into disrepair. And then it was
restored by the same guild in the year 529 of the Mālava era
(= A.D. 473).^238
Daśapura has been identified with Mandasor in Western
Malwa^239 formerly in the Gwalior State. The ancient Daśapura
stood on the north or left bank of the Siwana, a tributary of
the river Śiprā.^240 We also find it mentioned in the Mandasor
Fragmentary Inscription of the time of Ādityavardhana (A.D.
490-500).^241 Under the Imperial Guptas the use of the Mālava
or the Kṛta era seems to have been confined to Daśapura.^242
Thus Daśapura may have been the main city of the Western
Mālavas. We also get a reference to Daśapura in the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā^243 and the Meghadūta^244 of Kālidāsa.
The ancient Sanskrit name Daśapura also occurs in an early
Nasik inscription of Uṣavadāta,^245 and in one inscription of
Vikram Saṃvat 1321 (= A.D. 1264) from Mandasor itself.^246
There are two explanations of the name Daśapura or Dasor.
The local explanation is that the place was originally a city of
the Puranic king Daśaratha. But, on this view, the name of the
city should have been Daśarathapura or Dasrathore. Fleet
points out that even now, the township includes some twelve
to fifteen outlying hamlets or divisions (Khilcipur, Jankūpurā,
Rāmpuriyā, Candrapurā, Bālagañja, etc.) and that ‘when it was
originally constituted, it included exactly ten (daśa) such ham-
lets (pura)’.^247 This view of Fleet is more appealing.
Mandasor, the full form of the name of the town by which
it is officially known and which is entered in maps, is also
explained in two ways:
As suggested by Bhagwan Lal Indraji, it may represent
Manda-Daśapura, “the distressed or afflicted Daśapura,” referr-
ing to the overthrow of the town, and the destruction of the
Hindu temples in it, by the Musalmans, in memory of which,
even to the present day, the Nāgar brāhmaṇas of the area do
not drink water there. This is supported by the fact that some
paṇḍits still call it Mannadasor.^248
F.S. Growse suggests that the name combines the two
names of Mad and Daśapura: the former^249 being the name of
a village (also called Afzalpur) about eleven miles south-east of
Mandasor, from which, it is said, were brought, from ruined
Hindu temples, the stones that were used in the construction
of the Musalman fort at Mandasor.^250
It is very difficult to choose between the two explanations,
but the second seems to be more reasonable.

इन्द्रपुर
(4) Indrapura (No. 16, L. 5, L. 6, L. 7, L. 8):
The inscription states that an endowment was given by a brāh-
maṇa named Devaviṣṇu for the maintenance of a lamp in a
temple of the Sun established by the merchants of the town of
Indrapura kṣatriyas named Acalavarman and Bhrukuṇṭhasiṃha
at Indrapura.
In line 5 we get ‘Candrāpuraka-Padmā’ as the reading
taken by Fleet^251 and he thus considers it a separate town than
Indrapura.^252 But the correct reading should be as ‘Cendra-
puraka-Padmā’, since we find a small stroke by the left side of
‘c’. The stroke in other lines for ‘e’ is very clear (e. g. in L. 2)
though it is not very clear in L. 5 still we cannot read it simply
‘c’. The reading ‘ce’ for ‘c’ has been suggested by Sircar and
Jagannath.^253 Thus we see that the Padmā referred in line 5
of this inscription also belongs to Indrapura.
Now we find two different spellings of Indrāpura in lines 5
and 6 and Indrapura in lines 7 and 8.^254
What we can find out here is that the affix ‘ka’ in lines 5
and 6 is very important which seems to have grammatically a
succinct purpose here. The vṛddhi of the first vowel ‘i’ was
desirable here as is also clear by the use of affix ‘ka’ in the
Allahabad Inscription of Samudragupta.^255 So it is a weaker
form of the affix ‘ka’, without vṛddhi of the vowel in the first
syllable.^256 The writer seems to have used the long vowel
(with the last syllable of Indra) instead of vṛddhi in the first
syllable to avoid confusion between Aindrapura and Indrapura.
We do not find any such example of the elongation of vowel
in the classical Sanskrit literature though we find its rare use
in Vedic literature.^257 So we shall translate ‘Indrāpuraka Pad-
mā’ as ‘Padmā of (the town of) Indrapura and ‘Indrapuraka-
vaṇigbhyām’ as ‘merchants of (the town of) Indrapura’. This
Indrapura is the same as modern Indor,^258 near Dibhāi, Buland-
shahr district, U.P.^259 The ancient town of Indrapura was
situated on a large and lofty mound about five miles to the
north-west of Dibhāi.^260 Now-a-days it is only a kheḍā or deser-
ted mound, and is not shown in maps^261

कर्तृपुर
(5) Kartṛpura (No. I, L. 22):
Though the most accepted and correct reading is Kartṛpura,
some scholars prefer to read Katṛipura^262 or Kātripura.^263
It is one of the five frontier kingdoms^264 mentioned in the
inscription whose kings did homage and paid tribute to Samu-
dragupta. Scholars differ in their views about the identification
of this place-name:
According to smith,^265 this kingdom ‘occupied the lower
ranges of the western Himalayas, including probably Kumaon,
Garhwal, and Kangra’. Oldham^266 holds that the kingdom of
Kātripura, included Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal and Kangra.
Fleet^267 suggests that the name may survive in Kartarpur in
the Jullundur district.
We prefer the view of Daśaratha Sharma.^268 His conten-
tion is that amongst the five frontier kingdoms mentioned in
the inscription, the first three belong to the East, the fourth
one belongs to the North, hence it will be better to leave aside
the northern and eastern sides of the empire and to look for
Kartṛpura somewhere to the west of the Gupta dominions.
Consequently he finds Karor or Karūr to be a good equivalent
for Kartṛpura.^269 Kara here stands for Kartṛ and ‘ur’ or ‘ūr’
would stand here for pura.^270 Karūr, again, is to be preferred
to the other alternatives on account of its associations with the
Gupta period of Indian History. According to Al-Beruni, an
eastern king, called Vikramāditya, put to flight and killed a
Śaka ruler in the region of Karūr, between Multan and Loni.^271
This Vikramāditya is to be identified with Candragupta II
‘the enemy of the Śakas’, who disguised as his brother's wife,
Dhruvasvāminī, ‘ripped upon the belly of the Śaka ruler’,
and destroyed the Śaka army, most probably, in Kartṛpura or
Karūr.^272
This was the first encounter between the Śakas and Vikramā-
ditya, and Karūr, Karor, or Kartṛpura was the theatre of the
war because of its intermediate position between the Śaka
dominions and the Gupta empire.^273

identity,^276 but is possibly to be looked for in Bengal.^277

कुस्थलपुर
(7) Kusthalapura (No. I, L. 20):
Kusthalapura ruled by Dhanañjaya is mentioned as one of
the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms subdued by Samudragupta. Smith
takes it to be a mistake for Kuśasthalapura,^278 and identifies
it with the holy city of Dwarka, the capital of Ānartta, i. e.
North Gujarat.^279 Raj Bali Pandey also identifies it with
Kuśasthalī (Dwarka)^280 G. Ramdas locates the place in
Gujarat following Smith.^281 Monier Williams also identifies
Kuśasthala with the town of Dwarka.^282 Bhandarkar, follow-
ing Barnett identifies the place with Kuttalur near Polur in
North Arcot.^283
This Kuśasthalī is not situated in Gujarat but presumably on
the eastern spurs of the Vindhya range near Daksiṇakosala.^284
It was the capital of Kuśa, son of Rāmacandra.^285 But its
position in the list of the States of Dakṣiṇāpatha indicates a
place a little more to the south.
By the process of Haplology,^286 Kuśasthalapura is simpli-
fied into Kusthalapura which may be changed to Kuśasthalī
or Kuśāvatī in short.
The suffix sthala or sthalī is significant: it suggests a high-
lying country, an eminence, tableland, or dry-land as opposed
to a damp low-land.^287 The Mahābhārata, Harivaṃśa, early
Jain and Pali literature use the word in this sense.^288 The
Mahābhārata mentions both Kuśasthala as well as kuśa-sthalī.
The latter is supposed to be another name of Dwarka.^289

पाटलिपुत्र
(8) Pāṭaliputra (No. 7, L. 12; No. 6, L. 4; No. 1, L. 14):
It is the same as modern Patna situated to the south of the
river Gaṅgā. Inscription No. 7 refers to Pāṭaliputra. Inscrip-
tion No. 6 mentions Vīrasena, the child of Kutsa, the minister
for peace and war under Candragupta II, who knew the mean-
ings of the words, and logic, and (the ways of) mankind,
who was a poet and who belonged to (the city of) Pāṭali-
putra.^290 Inscription No. 1 mentions a city named Puṣpa
where Samudragupta enjoyed playfully while he was young.^291
Apparently, the city was the Gupta capital. We also find the
word Pāṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra) used by Aśoka, in his rock
edicts.^292 The city was also known as Kusumapura due to the
abundance of flowers.^293 Its name Puṣpapura is also met with
in the Raghuvaṃśa.^294 It is mentioned in the Mudrārākṣasa
as well.^295 The Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva^296 (11th century)
describes it as a place of both wealth and education though
generally there is a fight between Śrī (lakṣmī) and Sarasvatī.^297
The Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara (A.D. 900) mentions a
tradition that there were assemblies of scholars called brahma-
sabhās, organised by kings, which examined poets like Kālidāsa,
Bhartṛmaṇṭha, Amara, Rūpa, Āryaśūra, Bhāravi and Candra-
gupta in Viśālā (Ujjainī) and where such great masters of gram-
mar as Upavarṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararūci and
Patañjali were examined in Pāṭaliputra and attained fame.^298
The Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa^299 (A.D. 800) mentions Pāṭali-
putra as Nandanagara. This work refers to king Nanda, his
learned Council of brāhmaṇa philosophers and to his intimacy
with Pāṇini. “After him (Sūrasena) there will be king Nanda
at Puṣpa city. In the capital of the Magadha residents there
will be brāhmaṇa controversialists and the king will be surroun-
ded by them. The king will give them riches. His minister was
a Buddhist brāhmaṇa, Vararūci, who was of high soul, kind
and good. His great friend was a brāhmaṇa, Pāṇini by
name”.^300
The Kāśikā^301 records two divisions of Pāṭaliputra:
1. Pūrva-Pāṭaliputra (eastern on the Gaṅgā)
2. Apara-Pāṭaliputra (western on the Śoṇa)
Patañjali^302 mentions the western Pāṭaliputra. A citizen
of Pāṭaliputra was called Pāṭaliputraka.^303
The city is named as Palibothra by Megasthenes, the Am-
bassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of King Candragupta
Maurya.^304 The Pāla inscriptions refer to it by the name
Śrīnagara.^305
The termination ‘Putra’ in Pāṭaliputra is difficult to
explain. We find it being used with ‘Brahman’ to denote
the river ‘Brahmaputra’. As regards places-names we find the
mention of Saitya puta (Satiya-putra) and Kerala-puta (Kerala
putra) in Aśokan Rock-edicts.^306
The name Pāṭaliputra is taken to mean “the son (putra) of
Pāṭali, i. e. the trumpet flower. The words Puṣpapura and
Kusumapura also mean ‘a city of flowers’. The word ‘Śrīnag-
ara’ means ‘a beautiful city.^307 Because of the abundance of
flowers the city may have looked beautiful. It was known by
other names also, viz., Puṣpapura, Puspapurī and Kusumapura.^308
According to Yuan-Chwang, it had been called Kusumapura
(K' u-su-mo-pu-lo) on account of the numerous flowers (kus-
uma) in the royal enclosure.^309 Later its glory was replaced by
that of Kānyakubja which came to be known as Kusumapura.^310
The meaning of ‘Pāṭaliputra’ is explained in the legendary
origin of the city. According to the legend: there was a
brāhmaṇa of high talent and singular learning. Many flocked
to him to receive instruction. One day all his students went
out on a tour of observation. One of them looked very sad.
When asked, he told that his life was waning without any
company. In a joke his friends made the Pāṭali tree, under
which they were standing, his father-in-law: in other words
he was to marry the daughter of the tree, or a Pāṭali flower
(Bignonia Suaveloens).^311 As the Sun was about to set, all
the students proposed to return home but the young student
fascinated by love stayed there fearlessly. Accidentally, next
day he was married with the young daughter of an old couple.
After a year his wife gave birth to a son. He declined to stay
there fearing the exposure to wind and weather. But the
old man (the father of the wife) constructed a house for him
and made him stay there. When the old capital of Kusuma-
pura was changed, this town was chosen, and “as the genie
built the mansion for the youth the country was named as
Pāṭaliputrapura (the city of the son of the Pāṭali tree).”^312
It is not unlikely that originally the name of the city was
Pāṭaliputrapura and that later suffix Pura was dropped.
The Buddhist literature informs us that Pāṭaliputra was
originally a village known as Pāṭaligāma. Ajātaśatru is said
to have fortified it in order to check the attacks of the Licc-
havis who often harassed its inhabitants. The Buddha on his
way from Rājagṛha to Vaiśālī, passed through this village
on his last journey and is said to have predicted that the village
was destined to become a great city.^313
The Vāyu-Purāṇa attributes the real foundation of Pāṭali-
putra to Rājā Ajāta-Śatru's grandson, Udaya or Udayāśva.
It was he who first removed the capital from Rājagṛha to
Pāṭaliputra (during the last part of the 6th century B.C.)^314
Pāṭaliputra had closely been associated with multifarious
political and cultural activities right from the fifth century
B.C. to the later part of the sixth century A.D.^315 It had the
honour to be the capital of the Śaiśunāgas, the Nandas, the
Mauryas and the great Imperial Guptas until the Hūṇa inva-
sion in the 6th century A.D. when it was ruined. Harṣavardhana
(7th century A.D.) made no attempt to restore it.^316 Śaśāṅka
Narendragupta destroyed many Buddhist temples and monas-
teries at Pāṭaliputra.^317 Dharmapāla, the most powerful of
the Pāla kings of Bengal and Bihar, tried to restore its glory.^318
Coming to medieval times, we find that it remained deserted
for a number of centuries. It was Sher Shah, who, in about
A.D. 1541 occupied it again as a royal city and built a fort
there. It then came into importance under its modern name
Patna (from Skt. Pattana) i. e. the town or city. It is even now
the capital of Bihar.^319

पिष्टपुर
(9) Piṣṭapura (No. 1, L. 19):
It has been mentioned as one of the southern regions which
were first captured and then liberated by Samudragupta.^320
Mahendragiri is mentioned as its king. Piṣṭapura is the same
as the fortress Piṣṭapura captured by the Cālukya king
Pulakeśin II. The Tāṇḍivāda grant of Pṛthivī Mahārāja also
refers to Piṣṭapura.^321 Piṣṭapura is modern Pithapuram in the
Godavari district of the Madras Presidency.^322 It was the
capital of Kaliṅga.^323 ‘Kaliṅgādhipati’ Anantavarman issued
a grant^324 from the victorious city of Piṣṭapura. This grant
records that Anantavarman's grandfather Guṇavarman ruled
over Devarāṣṭra with Piṣṭapura as its chief city.^325 In our
inscription Devarāṣṭra^326 has been treated separately. It seems
that during Samudragupta's time these two States (Devarāṣṭra
and Kaliṅga) were separate states but later on under Guṇavar-
man they were amalgamated.
Guha ruled over the whole of Kaliṅga and the neighbour-
ing regions.^327 Guha belonged to the Sālaṅkāyana family of
brāhmaṇas. Samudragupta installed him as his viceroy in
Kaliṅga.^328 Guha was already reigning over Kaliṅga (with his
capital at Piṣṭapura) when Samudragupta conquered him and
placed him as his feudatory. ‘Mahendragiri’ may have been
another name given to him on account of the extension of
his dominion over the Mahendra mountain.^329 It is interesting
to note that Kālidāsa^330 refers to Raghu defeating a king
named Mahendranātha in the course of his southern campaign.
It is tempting to connect Mahendranātha with Mahendragiri.
After the victory of Samudragupta, Guha was confirmed in
the enjoyment of sovereignty under the imperial tutelage.^331
At Piṣṭapura there is a Vaiṣṇava temple named Kunti-
mādhava.^332 We get references to Piṣṭapurī or Piṣṭapurikādevī,
a form at Mānapura, of the goddess Lakṣmī, in the inscriptions
of the Privrājaka Mahārājas and the Mahārājas of Uccakalpa
during the Gupta period.^333 This must be a local form of some
popular goddess at Piṣṭapura itself.^334

नगर
 Nagara:
Nagara means a town, a city.^335 we find the term being
used by Pāṇini (IV. 2. 142).^336 The word Nāgaraka (or
Nāgarika)^337 also occurs in Sanskrit literature as standing for
‘an inhabitant of a town’ but sometimes its use was restricted
for the chief of a town or a police-officer. In modern times
nāgarika is used to refer to ‘a citizen of a state whether living
in city or village’.
In the early Vedic literature Nagara is found only as the
derivative adjective Nagarin, used as a proper name, but it
appears in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (1. 11,
18: 31, 4) and frequently in the later works.^338
Nagara is an important factor which helps us to distinguish
Janapada from rāṣṭra: nagara forms a part of the rāṣṭra but
is excluded from the Janapada.^339 Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra
uses Nagara and Pura as synonyms.^340 It is significant that
the word Nagara is of late occurrence.^341 It is likely
that in the early Vedic times city life does not seem to have
developed much. In the Epic,^342 there are references to
Nagara, ‘a city’: Grāma ‘Village’: and Ghoṣa ‘ranch’. Vedic
literature especially of the earlier period is generally confined
to the village. The siege of puras is mentioned in the Saṃhitās

The word Nagara is changed into:^343
(a) Nar as Kuśīnagara, Kusinar, Girinagara, Girnar
(b) Ner as Jīrṇanagara, Jooner.
In modern times the suffix nagara is sometimes used to
denote an inhabitation or Mohalla e. g. Tilak Nagar, Subhash
Nagar, Patel Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Lajapat Nagar.
We do not find any place-name with the suffix ‘nagara’ in

suffix nagarī, which is given below:

Pañcanagarī literally means ‘a multitude of five towns’.
Five small localities might have been collected into one for the

अयोध्या
(2) Ayodhyā (No. 21, L. 1; No. 37, L. 6; No. 39, L. 10):
In No. 21 the word ‘Ayodhyā-Vāsaka’ occurs^355 while in No. 37
and 39 the word ‘Āyodhyaka’ has been mentioned. In No, 21,
Ayodhyā is described as a victorious camp. full of great ships,
and elephants and horses. In No. 39 certain brāhmaṇas belong-
ing to Ayodhyā, living in the vicinity of Mahādeva Śaileśvara
are named and are mentioned as belonging to various gotras
and caraṇas, and as proficient in observants, in sacred duty,
in the mantras, the sūtras, bhāṣyas and pravacanas.^356
It has been venerated as one of the most important and
holy places of the Hindus.^357 Vinītā was another name for
this city.^358 Its other names including Viṇīā (Vinītā) are men-
tioned in the Vividhatīrthakalpa.^359 Fa-Hsien calls it Sha-che
and Ptolemy knew it as Sogeda.^360 Ayodhyā and Sāketa have
been treated by many writers as being identical. Csoma de
kōrös^361 calls this place as “Sāketan or Ayodhyā” and H.H.
Wilson in his dictionary, refers to Sāketa as ‘the city of
Ayodhyā’. Several passages in the Raghuvaṃśa^362 confirm it.
The Vividhatīrthakalpa mentions Sākeyam (Sāketa) as a
synonym for Ayodhyā,^363 but in the Buddhist literature we find
separate references to Ayodhyā and Sāketa which creates
doubt about their identity and suggests that the two existed
separately.^364 V. Pathak quotes a well known verse occurring
in the Yuga Purāṇa, a section of Gārgī Saṃhitā,^365 to show
that Sāketa is the same as Ayodhyā. But there is nothing in
the passage to support the view.
The ancient city of Ayodhyā or Sāketa is described in the
Rāmāyaṇa as situated on the banks of the Sarayū or Sarjū
river.^366 During the Buddhist period, Ayodhyā was divided into
Uttara (Northern) Kosala and Dakṣiṇa (Southern) Kosala.
The river Sarayū was the dividing line between the two pro-
vinces. Ayodhyā was the capital of the latter.^367 Ancient
tradition believes it to have been built by Manu.^368
The history of Kośala, with its mighty King Prasenajit and
his son Vidudabha pales into insignificance with the emergence
of the Magadhan rulers as powerful antagonists. The Nandas,
followed by the Mauryas, assimilated Kośala in their empire.
Under the Śuṅgas, it was being ruled by a viceroy. An inscrip-
tion from Ayodhyā mentions Puṣyamitra as having performed
two horse-sacrifices. Under the Kuṣāṇas, the city remained
more or less in oblivion. Subsequently in the Purāṇas it figures
along with Prayāga and Magadha as forming part of
the kingdom of the Guptas. The spurious Gayā Plate of
Samudragupta (No. 21) mentions it as a seat of a Gupta
camp of victory. The history of the city in the post-
Gupta period is wrapped up in obscurity. It was within the
empire of the Pratihāras and Gāhaḍavālas of Kanauj. Ayodhyā
is described by Muslim historians^369 to have been a wilder-
ness.
The Slaves and Khilji rulers held sway over it, and subse-
quently it received importance as the headquarters of Oudh.
It was under the charge of Muslim governors appointed from
Delhi, but with the emergence of Jaunpur as a strong kingdom
Ayodhyā was completely over-shadowed. It was a mint-town
in the time of Akbar, but there is no reference to it in later
Chronicles.^370
Ayodhyā is important as a centre of pilgrimage. There are
several places in the city connected with different events in the
life of Rāma. Rāma was born at a place called Janmasthāna. At
Chīrodaka also called Chīrasāgara, Daśaratha performed, with
the help of Ṛṣyaśṛṅga Ṛṣi, the sacrifices for obtaining a son.
At a place called Tretā-kā-Ṭhākur, Rāmacandra performed the
horse sacrifice by setting up the image of Sītā. At Ratnamaṇ-
ḍapa, he held his Council,^371 at Swargadwāram in Fyzabad,
his body was burnt. At Lakṣmaṇa-kuṇḍa, Lakṣmaṇa disappeared
in the river Sarayū. Daśaratha accidentally killed Śravaṇa,
the blind Ṛṣi's son, at Majhaurā in the district of Fyzabad.^372
Ayodhyā engaged the attention of the Muslim rulers some of
whom set up mosques here, of these the mosques of Babar and
and Aurangzeb are notable.^373 At present this city forms a
part of the district of Fyzabad.

ईश्वरवासक
(3) Īśvaravāsaka (No. 5, L. 6)^374:
It seems to be a village or an allotment of land granted by
Āmrakārddava, the son of Undāna, and apparently an officer
of Candragupta II to the Āryasaṃgha at the great vihāra of
Kākanādaboṭa for the purpose of feeding mendicants.^375 The
word Īśvara here is connected with Vāsaka and there is no infix
or place-name suffix in between (just as ‘pura’ in Ānandapura-
vāsaka). Hence vāsaka here has a double purpose. It is mean-
ingful to Īśvara and also denotes the inhabitation. The whole
will literally mean ‘an inhabitation of God’.

महाकान्तार
2. Mahākāntāra (No. 1, L. 19):
It is one of the southern countries subdued by Samudragupta.
Its ruler was Vyāghararāja. Literally Mahākāntāra means ‘a
great forest’. It has to be distinguished from Sarvāṭavi referred
to later on in this inscription.^378 According to Krishnaswami
Aiyangar,^379 it must have included the Saugar division of C.P.
extending northwards to the Ajaigadh State in Bundelkhanda.
But G. Ramdas differs from this view on the ground that Mahā-
kāntāra must be sought in Southern India as it is specifically
mentioned as one of the kingdoms of the South conquered
by Samudragupta. He suggests that Mahākāntāra must be the
same as Mahāvana, a forest region extending northwards into
Ganjam Agency and westwards into the tract formerly
known as the Chatisgarh States of C.P.^380 This very region has
been mentioned by the same name in the Ganj and Nachna

ग्राम
 Grāma:
It means an inhabited place, village, hamlet.^383 It seems
that firstly the word grāma denoted the collective inhabi-
tants of a place, community or race. Later on this sense was
transferred to an inhabitation and was used in the sense of a
village. The earlier usage of this word, which occurs frequently
from the Ṛgveda^384 onwards, appears to have been in the sense
of a village. The early Āryans must have dwelt in villages which
were scattered over the country, some close together, some far
apart, and were connected by roads.^385 In the early Vedic
literature village is regularly contrasted with the forest (āraṇya)
in the evening the cattle regularly returned thither from the
forest.^386 The villages were probably open, though perhaps a
fort(pur) might on occasion be built inside.^387 Presumably they
consisted of detached houses with enclosures, but no details
are to be found in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahā-
grāmāḥ) were known.^388 The grāma may, however, perhaps
be regarded more correctly as an aggregate of several fami-
lies, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
(viś), as is often the case at the present day.^389 The head of the
village was called Grāmaṇi or ‘the leader of the village’. The
king's share in a village is referred to as early as the
Atharvaveda.^390
Villages played an important role as a unit of Rāṣṭra or
city.^391 Kheṭa was the half of a city and the village was the
half of a kheṭa.^392 Cities other than the capital are called
Karvaṭa, a little less is Nigama and lesser is grāma and still
lesser is a house.^393
Grāma is changed into gaon,^394 as Suvarṇagrāma, Sonār-
gaon; Kalahagrāma, Kahalgaon.
Following are the place-name with this suffix. We have also
included here some place-names which are villages though they
have not been termed as such with this suffix.

takes ‘Samudra’ to be the ‘nām-aika-deśa of a deity called
Samuderśvara’ and suggests that the relevant passage is to be
corrected as ‘pārago bharaḍida-samudreśvara’.^398 The meaning

population.

cellent wind or air’. The village might have been noted for its

दोङ्गाग्राम
(5) Doṅgā-grāma (No. 34, L. 11; No. 36. L. 6):
In No. 34 we get a reference to ‘Doṅgā’, but in No. 36, the
name appears as Doṅgā-grāma.
The Doṅgā-grāma is said to have been situated in Himavac-
Chikhara^403 identified with Barāhachatra (Varāhakṣetra) in
Nepal.^404 But scholars^405 are not right in co-relating Doṅgā-
grāma with Himavac-Chikhara, Inscription No. 36 clarifies it.
There is a long gap between the references to Himavac-
Chikhara and Doṅgā-grāma. Actually Himavac-Chikhara is
associated with Kokāmukhasvāmin (a form of the Boar incar-
nation of Viṣṇu) and Śvetavarāhasvāmin where originally (ādya)
these gods were installed in a temple. The name Doṅgā-grāma
is used for the place where the lands were donated by Ṛbhupāla
for the construction of the two temples having the names of the
two deities.^406 The word ‘ādya’ in L. 7 is significant and dis-
tinguishes the temples at Himavac-Chikhara from those at
Doṅgā-grāma. The writer had to use the word ‘Himavac-
Chikhara’ again in L. 10, with the names of Kokāmukhasvāmin
and Śvetavarāhasvāmin in order to avoid confusion between
the temples at the two places. For the temple at Doṅgā-grāma
the writer uses the word ‘iha’ in L. 11. We also find the word
‘Himavac-Chikhara’ absent in another Dāmodarpur Copper
Plate Inscription of the Gupta Year 224 (= A.D. 543), where
a person named Amṛtadeva hailing from Ayodhyā donates a
land for the repairs and worship, etc., at the temple of Lord
Śvetavarāhasvāmin obviously because he was referring to the
temple at Doṅgā-grāma and there was now, no question of any
confusion or distinction.^407 Thus Doṅgāgrāma does not seem
to have any connection with Himavac-Chikhara. This village
is to be located somewhere near Dāmodarpur and belonged to
the Koṭivarṣa viṣaya as mentioned in the records.^408 But the
village was most probably situated in a hilly area which is clear
from the word Doṅgā itself.^409 The word ‘Atrāraṇye’ (local
forest where the temple of Śvetavarāhasvāmin was situated) in
No. 37 also attests to it.^410 The village may have consisted of a
few huts with bushes and trees all around or the place where
the temples were situated was away from habitation.
Thus the earlier suggestion that the Koṭivarṣa district
included the hilly region bordering on the northern fringe of
Bengal,^411 which was rejected by Sircar,^412 seems to be
correct.

14. Pūrṇṇanāga grāma (No. 40, L. 5):
The village belonged to a viṣaya called Kṛmilā in Nālandā,

serpents’ and in this respect the name may be compared
with the name Kṛmilā of the viṣaya which means ‘full of Kṛmis
or worms’.

संगोहलिकग्राम
16. Saṃgohalikagrāma (No. 43, L. 2, L. 20):
Saṃgohālika was the name of a village. In L. 2 we get the form
Saṃgohāli, while in L. 20, it is mentioned as Saṃgohalikā-
grāma.^432 Sircar takes the reading to be ‘Gulmagandhikā-
grāma’ in place of Saṃgohālikagrāma.^433 But Saṃgohālika-
grāma is the correct form. We can compare Saṃgohāli in L. 2
of this inscription with the letters appearing in L. 20. The first
three letters are no doubt not fully legible, but the two remain-
ing are surely ‘lika’. Thus the name can never be Gulmagan-
dhikā, most probably it was Saṃgohālika. Moreover, the
context of both the lines 20 and 2 is the same.
The word gohālī when joined with the suffix ‘saṃ’ means
‘a good gohālī’. In Inscription No. 28 the word gohālī has in
all cases been spelt with long ‘ī’, i. e. gohālī.^434

the abode of good people where lived a person, who bore the
distinguished appellation Śrīdeva.^437
Vaṭodaka has been identified with Badoh which is a small

पल्ली
 Pallī
The suffix — palli, pallī, pallaka or its diminutive pallikā is
derived from §pal to go, to move.^442 It means a small village,
(esp.) a settlement of wild tribes (e. g. Triśira-pallī = Trichin-
opoly).^443 Pallī has been used as meaning a den of thieves in
the Uttarādhyanasūtra and other Jain canonical texts,^444 the
earliest portions of which are assigned to about 300 B.C.^445
The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra by king Bhojadeva, an ele-
venth century work, defines Pallī thus:
“Where Pulindas^446 live building their huts with leafs,
branches and stones etc. is called Pallī and a small Pallī is
called Pallīkā”.^447
Its derivation from §pal to go, to move, fits in very well as
it was an inhabitation of Ābhīras, thieves and barbarians who
moved from one place to another and were usually in small
number.
It seems to be a Dravidian word loaned in Sanskrit. We
find in Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada the word palli meaning
hamlet, settlement, small village and in Telugu the words Palli
and Palliya denoting ‘a small village’.^448
Pallī^449 is changed into:
(a) bal: Āśāpallī, Yessabal
(b) Poli, as Triśirapallī (= Trishṇāpallī), Trichinopoly
(c) oli, as Ahalyapallī, Ahiroli (also Ahiāri).
We have only one place-name ending in this suffix, with
a slight variation which is ‘palla’ and is detailed below:

एरण्डपल्ल
 Eraṇḍapalla (No. I, L. 19):
It is mentioned in the list of countries of Southern region
conquered by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Damana. Fleet
identifies Eraṇḍapalla with Erandol in the E. Khandesh
district of the Bombay Presidency.^450 K.N. Dikshit and Y.R.
Gupte agreed with this view.^451 But according to Dubreuil and
K.G. Sankar, it is the same as the town Erandpalli near
Chicacole on the Coast of Orissa.^452 G. Ramdas opposes
Fleet's identification on the ground that Eraṇḍapallī mentioned
immediately after the kingdom of Svāmidatta cannot be so far
away on the western coast, it must have been in the vicinity
of Kaliṅga and Piṣṭapura kingdom.^453 Eraṇḍapallī is mentioned
in the Siddhantam plates of Devendravarman of Kaliṅga.^454
Banerjee counts Damana of Eraṇḍapalla among the three
chiefs of Kaliṅga who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta
through their country.^455
G. Ramdas^456 regards Dubreuil's identification also to
be incorrect because Chicacole lies in Kaliṅga which was clearly
the country ruled by Svāmidatta. Eraṇḍapallī will have, there-
fore, to be identified with the village Yendipalli in the Golgonda
Taluka of the Vizagapatam district or with the village Eṇḍapalli
in Elore Tāluka.^457 But if we suppose that Svāmidatta was
the king of Koṭṭūra alone and not of the whole of Kaliṅga,
Eraṇḍapallī may well be identified with Chicacole.^458
Palla is the corrupt form of Pallī which means an inhabitation
and Eraṇḍa is the castor-oil-plant^459 It seems that the region
abounded in eraṇḍa plants.

गोहाली
 Gohālī
The word gohālī is derived from Sanskrit gośālā which is
transformed into goāl in Bengali.^460 It is generally spelt with
long ‘ī’ i. e. as gohālī,^461 but in No. 43 it has been spelt with
short ‘i’.^462 This suffix has been used with the names of villages.
These villages were known as gohālikas,^463 in a similar context

These villages were probably full of cowherds. In Assam such
villages are known as goālpāṛā.

unded, covered’.^468 The village may have been surrounded by a
well or fence. On one hand we find another village named as

क्षेत्र
 Kṣetra
Originally meaning an agricultural field, in which sense its
use survives, kṣetra came to be used as a place-name suffix
as we find in the word Kurukṣetra. As a suffix in com-
position it signified simply a ‘field’ for the word preceding it.
For example karma-kṣetra, dharma-kṣetra, raṇa-kṣetra, siddha-
kṣetra, sureśvarī-kṣetra.^480
The use of this word^481 in the Ṛgveda points clearly to the
existence of separate fields^482 carefully measured off,^483 though
in some passages the meaning is less definite, indicating culti-
vated land generally.^484 In the Atharvaveda^485 and later, the
sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the more
general use is also found.^486 The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,^487 ‘Lord
of the Field’ should probably be understood as the god presid-
ing over each field, just as Vāstoṣpati presides over each
dwelling.^488
Kṣetra is changed into:^489
(a) Chatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahichatra
(b) Cchatra as Ahikṣetra, Ahicchatra.
In Prakrit Kṣetra changes to Kheṭṭa meaning ‘a land for
agriculture’, country, village and city, etc.^490
Analogous to Kheṭṭa is the word ‘kheḍa’ or ‘kheṭa’ which
means ‘a city surrounded by rivers and mountains’.^491 ‘Kheṭa’
meaning ‘a small hamlet’ is also found in Pāṇini (VI. 2. 126).^492
The Samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra defines ‘Kheṭa’ as the half of a
city and the grāma as the half of a ‘Kheṭa’.^493 According to
Monier Williams Kheṭa means a village, residence of peasants
and farmers, small town (half of a Pura).^494
Lele^495 considers Kheṭa or Kheṭaka to be the dialectic form
of the word ‘Kṣetra’. The original meaning of Kheṭaka or Kheṭa
was an enclosure for cattle. In the course of time the pastoral
camp grew into an agricultural village, and the word Kheṭaka
came to include agricultural village.^496
Here we collect the names of fields appearing in the inscri-
ptions of our study. These names can be attributed to the
names of individuals or gods. As the proper names are a part
of the names of the fields, we treat them as place-names and do
not discuss them in the context of personal-names. Some of
the names sound curious and at places the readings are doubt-
ful, the fascimile of the grant supplied by the editor being
blurred. It is interesting to note that all these names occur
in the same inscription, i. e. Gunaighar Grant of Vainya-
gupta, year 188 (No. 52). Gunaighar formerly Guṇikāgra-
hāra,^497 is a village about 18 miles to the north-west of the
town of Comilla, a mile and a half to the south west of the P.S.
Debidvar in the district of Tippera which is modern Tripur.^498
The area is predominated by Tibeto-Burman tribes. Hence
some of the names are full of tribal vocabulary.^499

The field belonged to Miduvilāla. The word Midu is a Prakritic

ful. Pāia-Sadda-Mahaṇṇavo^505 takes Vilāla, Birāla, Biḍāla,
Bilāḍa and Bilāla as synonymous words meaning ‘a cat’. Ac-
cording to Bhattacharya ‘the word vilāla is evidently derived
from vila with its peculiar meaning (a large watery hollow)
current in Bengal.^506 D.C. Sircar takes it to be a mechanic
caste like vardhaki (carpenter).^507 We find the word Vilāla
occurring thrice in the Gunaighar grant (No. 52) which has
been translated by the editor of the grant as follows:
(a) Miduvilāla-kṣetra (L. 19): The field of Miduvilāla
(b) Pakkavilāla-kṣetra (LL. 21-22): The field of Pakkavilāla
(c) Gaṇeśvara-Vilāla-Puṣkariṇī (L. 28): the large marshy
pond of Gaṇeśvara.
All the three names have been explained according to their
context in this work.
In (a) and (b) the editor takes vilāla as a part of the names
Midu and Pakka but in (c) he translates vilāla as ‘a large
marshy (place)’. The editor should have taken either Miduvi-
lāla and Pakkavilāla as the adjectives of the fields as in (c) or
Vilāla as an adjective of Gaṇeśvara and not that of Puṣkariṇī.
Vilāla seems to be a part of the names Midu and Pakka which
if left alone yield no meaning, but in the case of Gaṇeśvara
vilāla, the word vilāla seems to be an adjective of the name
Gaṇeśvara rather than a part of it. Here the word vilāla seems
to indicate a professional caste. It is a Dravidian word.^508 The
whole sense of the name ‘Miduvilāla’ is not clear.

based on god Viṣṇu. The second part of his name seems to be
dropped and instead his professional epithet ‘vardhakin’ has
been added which means ‘a carpenter’.^519 In Sāñcī Stūpa Ins-

was a country in the South while Avimukta or Kāśī is an eas-
tern country. It may be considered to be situated in the Goda-

कामरूप
3. Kāmarūpa (No. I, L. 22):
It has been mentioned as one of the frontier states which were
subordinate to Samudragupta and whose emperors paid him
taxes and all kinds of obeisance. Majumdar^539 identifies it with
Upper Assam. Kāmarūpa consisted of the Western districts of
the Brahmaputra valley which being the most powerful state
and being the first to be approached from the western side
came to denote the whole valley.^540 The area of Kāmarūpa
was estimated by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang to have
been 10,000 li i. e. 1667 miles in circuit which shows that it
must have comprised the whole valley of Brahmaputra.^541
Śaktisaṅgama describes^542 Kāmarūpa as extending from Kāle-
śvara to the Śvetagiri and from Tripura to the Nīla-parvata
(which is the Nilādri or Nīlakūṭa, the name of the Kāmākhyā
hill). According to the Yoginī Tantra, the kingdom of Kāma-
rūpa included the whole of the Brahmaputra valley together
with Rangpur and Cochbihar.^543 The Purāṇas mention Prāg-
jyotiṣa, identified with Kāmākhyā or Gauhati, as the capital of
Kāmarūpa.^544 The Kamauli grant of Vaidyadeva mentions
Kāmarūpa as a Maṇḍala of the Prāgjyotiṣa-bhukti.^545
The Abhidhāna, the Vaijayantī and the Trikāṇḍaśeṣa in-
form us that Prāgjyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa were the same coun-
try.^546 In the Raghuvaṃśa,^547 the separate mention of Prāg-
jyotiṣa and Kāmarūpa may seem to be a little puzzling. But
we see that whereas verses 81-82 of the fourth canto refer to
the king of Prāgjyotiṣa as terrified, the subsequent verses
describe the presentation of elephants and the offer of respects
by the king of Kāmarūpa to Raghu. Thus all the four verses
are inter-linked and, the context also proves that Prāgjyotiṣa
and Kāmarūpa were the same.^548 The Buddhist Chronicle
Ārya-mañjuśrī-mūlakalpa describes Kāmarūpa as a country of
the east.^549 The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^550 and the Kāvyamīmāṃsā^551
also mention it in the same direction. Chatterji remarks that
the tribes living on the frontiers of Kāmarūpa were akin to the
Man tribes of South-Western China, a wild Tibeto-Chinese
people.^552
The Ahoms of the Shan Tribe came into Assam at the be-
ginning of the 13th century due to the break-up of the Chinese
empire by the Moguls and ruled till the British occupation in
the beginning of the 19th century.^553

काञ्ची
4. Kāñcī (No. I, L. 19):
The earliest epigraphic mention of Kāñcī is to be found in this
inscription. The inscription refers to Viṣṇugopa of Kāñcī as
one of the kings of Dakṣiṇāpatha defeated by Samudragupta
but reinstated in their kingdoms. Kāñcī is the same as Kāñcīpura
or modern Conjeevaram in the Chingleput district of Madras
Presidency.^554 The kingdom of Kāñcī extended from the mouth
of the Krishna to the south of the river Palar and sometimes
even to the Kaveri.^555 It is also known as Kāñcīpeḍu.^556 It is
mentioned in several early records relating to the ancient his-
tory of the Pallavas of Kāñcī (of about A.D. 250 to 355)^557 The
Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin, the Cālukya ruler in the 7th
century A.D. refers to his conquest of Kāñcīpura.^558 The ear-
liest literary reference to Kāñcī is in the Mahābhāṣya of Patañ-
jali.^559
The Mahābhāṣya on Vārttika 26 to Pāṇini IV. 2. 104 men-
tions Kāñcīpuraka (i. e. a resident of Kāñcīpura).^560 Hiuen
Tsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li or 5 miles in circuit, and
that in the city there were eighty Deva temples and many here-
ties called Nirgranthas.^561
The Purāṇas attach great importance to Kāñcī.^562 It is
included in a list of seven holy cities of India.^563 The Brah-
māṇḍa Purāṇa^564 associates Kāñcī with Kāśī, the two forming
the two eyes of Śiva. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya sūtra^565
that Kāñcī is a Śākta-kṣetra. In the Devībhāgavata^566, Kāñcī
is said to be a sthāna of the Devī called Annapūrṇā.^567 The
Vāmana Purāṇa^568 mentions it as the best among the cities.
The Skandapurāṇa^569 counts it amongst the holy places. The
Bhāgavatapurāṇa^570 and the Yoginītantra^571 also mention it.
In Daśakumāracaritam^572 it is referred to as a city of the Drāviḍa
country.
Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. Śiva Kāñcī and Viṣṇu
Kāñcī form the western and eastern parts of the city, while
the Jaina Kāñcī is known as Tiruparutti-Kunram.^573 Of the
temples at Conjeevaram, the most famous are the Kāmākṣī
temple with a Cakra placed in front of the deity, the Vaikuṇṭha
Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Śhiva temple of Kailā-
śanātha.^574
Apart from its religious significance Kāñcī has been a
famous centre of learning. The Pallava ruler Mahendravarman,
the author of the Mattavilāsa-Prahasana; Bhāravi, the author
of the Kirātārjunīyam and Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumār-
acaritam are said to have flourished here.^575
The famous Buddhist dialectician Dinnāga came here to
satisfy his intellectual and spiritual thirst and about the middle
of the fourth century A.D., the brāhmaṇa Mayūraśaraman,
who founded the Kadamba line came here for getting recogni-
tion in Vedic learning.^576 The Ādi-guru Śaṅkarācārya establi-
shed here the famous Pīṭha known as Kāmakotipīṭha.^577
Literally Kāñcī means a ‘girdle’. It seems to have been so
named because it is situated like a girdle round the sea.

काशी
5. Kāśī (No. 28, L. 6):
It is mentioned in Inscription No. 28. According to the in-
scription a vihāra at Vaṭa-gohālī was inhabited by the disciples
of the Nigrantha preceptor (Śramaṇācārya) Guhanandin,
belonging to the Pañca-stūpa section (nikāya) of Kāśī.^578
Evidently Vaṭagohālī was a seat of Jain monks who had their
major seat at Kāśī.
The name Kāśī is derived from the root Kaś ‘to shine’.
The Skandapurāṇa^579 says that the city of Kāśī became famous
by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvāṇa or
because, that indescribable refulgence, viz. god Śiva shines
forth here.^580 B.C. Law connects it with Ti-miao meaning ‘read
sprouts’, a Chinese translation of the word and this links it
with a certain kind of grass.^581 It has been known for centuries
under five different names, viz., Vārāṇasī (modern Banaras),
Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśma-
śāna.^582
The earliest mention of the Kāśīs as a tribal people occurs
in the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda.^583 Vārāṇasī
was the capital of the people of Kāśī.^584 Thus it seems that
geographically Kāśī represented a larger area than Vārāṇasī, the
latter being the capital of the former. But in medieval times
the position became just the reverse. Vārāṇasī comprehended
the entire district and Kāśī generally represented only a small
place. In a grant of Mahārāja Vināyakapāla we get a reference
to a village of Tikkarikā situated in the Pratiṣṭhāna-bhukti,
and attached to Kāśī-pāra-Pathaka which belonged to Vārāṇasī
viṣaya.^585 Kāśī pāra-pathaka represented the site of the ancient
city of the Kāśī.^586 The Vividhatīrthakalpa^587 also mentions
Kāśī as a janapada in the Vārāṇasī City.
The ancient kingdom of Kāśī was bounded by Kośala on the
north, Magadha on the east, and Vatsa on the west. The
Cedis and Karuṣas lived to their south.^588 At the time of
Buddha, the kingdom of Kāśī was absorbed by the kingdom of
Kośala.^589
We know that Lord Buddha gave his first discourse near
Kāśī in the Deer Park at Sārnāth. Kāśī was an important
Buddhist centre and was a seat of monastic establishments in
the time of Aśoka.^590 During the period of Gupta rule it was
on its way to become a strong centre of Śiva worship with the
mahāliṅgas set up in different parts of the city.^591 The Purāṇas
include the region in the Gupta empire.^592
It was a great centre of trade and commerce. Patañjali in
his Mahābhāṣya^593 mentions Kāśī cloth. The Buddhist litera-
ture gives us many accounts of the merchants of the city.^594
Kāśī has been a place of much importance for Hindu pil-
grimage. Its religious importance has been discussed at length
in the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. Lord Śiva never
leaves it, hence it is known as Avimukta. A man who dies here
is believed to get emancipation.^595

6. Kosala (No. 1, L. 19):
It is spelt both ways with the dental as well as with the palatal
sibilant. It is included in the list of the Dakṣiṇāpatha kingdoms
whose kings were conquered but reinstated by Samudragupta.
At that time Mahendra was its ruler. It has been identified
with South Kosala corresponding to modern district of Raipur,
Sambalpur and Bilaspur of M.P. and Orissa.^596 Its old capital
was Śrīpura (modern Sirpur), 40 miles north-east of Raipur.^597 It
is the same as Mahā-kosala^598 which forms the largest unit among
the three component parts of the State of Madhya Pradesh.^599
The recent excavation at Eraṇ has thrown a flood of new light
on the early history of eastern Malwa and Mahākosala between
the period 1900 B.C. and A.D. 600. During the Gupta period
several Brahmanical temples were built in this region. In the
early medieval period i. e. from A.D. 600 to 1200, the Candellas
and Kalacuris were the two chief ruling dynasties in the
Mahākosala area. In the period of Muslim rule followed by
Maratha supremacy, many forts and fortresses were built
by the ruling chiefs^600 in different parts of Mahākosala.
Dakṣiṇa Kosala is mentioned in the Ratnāvalī (Act IV) as
having been conquered by Udayana, king of Vatsa.^601
N.L. Dey^602 identifies Dakṣiṇa Kosala with Tosalī of
Aśoka's inscription (Tosala) at Dhauli, which is situated near
Bhuvaneśwar in the Puri district, Orissa. Sylvain Levi suggests
an Austric origin for this wold. ‘Kosala changing to Tosala is
an apparent variation of the initial due to the formative
prefix’^603 in the Austric languages. The country of Tosala also,
like Kosala, had two divisions: Uttara Tosala and Dakṣiṇa
Tosala.^604 Dakṣiṇa Tosala consisted of a maṇḍala of the name
of Koṅgoda. In some cases by mistake the reading Dakṣiṇa
kosala is given in place of Dakṣiṇa Tosala.^605 But it is clear
from other evidence that Tosala and Kosala were two separate
entities. The purāṇas mention them separately.^606 The Kāvya-
mīmāṃṣā also makes a separate reference to the two.^607

7. Koṭṭūra (No. 1, L. 19):
It is mentioned as one of the Southern kingdoms conquered by
Samudragupta. Its ruler was Svāmidatta. It has been identified
by N. Dubreuil with Kothoor in Ganjam.^608 Banerjee counts
Svāmidatta of Koṭṭūra among the three chiefs of Kaliṅga
who obstructed the passage of Samudragupta through their
country.^609
According to Fleet Koṭṭūr (from Koṭṭapura) being a very
common Dravidian name, may be looked for in any Koṭṭūra
of note, in a mountainous part of Southern India, e. g. possibly
Koṭṭūr in the Coimbatore district, at the foot of one of the
passes in the Anaimalai Hills.^610 R. Sathianathaier proposes
to identify Koṭṭūra with Koṭṭūra near Tuni (E. Godavari dis-
trict) and maintains that Samudragupta did not pass through
Orissa, Ganjam and Vizagapatam^611 There is another
Koṭṭūra in the Vizagapatam district.^612 But the generally
accepted view is to identify it with Kothoor in Ganjam.

8. Kurāla (No. I, L. 19):
It has been mentioned as one of the kingdoms of Dakṣiṇāpatha
subdued by Samudragupta. Its ruler was Maṇṭarāja. Fleet
suggests that Kaurālaka is a mistake for Kairalaka, denoting
the well known province Kerala in the South of India.^613
D.R. Bhandarkar^614 identifies this Kerala with the Sonpur
territory in C.P. round about Yayātinagara where the author
of the Pavanadūta locates the Keralas. Barnett identified it
with modern village Korāḍa in South India.^615 Kurāḷa is
taken by Kielhorn^616 to be the same as Kunāla mentioned in
the Aihole inscription of Pulakeśin II^617 and identified with
the Kolleru lake between the Godavari and the Krishna.^618
But D.R. Bhandarkar^619 objects to this view on the ground
that the Kolleru lake must have been included in the kingdom
of Veṅgī mentioned later on^620 in the same list in the inscrip-
tion. G. Ramdas^621 seems to be right when he observes that
Kurāḷa must be the plain country of the Ganjam district to
the north-east of the Mahendra hill now chiefly occupied by
the Oriyas.

नेपाल
9. Nepāla (No. I, L. 22):
It is mentioned as one of the border states which accepted the
subordination of Samudragupta. Some take it to refer to
Tippera^622 which is doubtful.^623 The city is said to have been
founded by Ne ṛṣi who performed his religious services at the
junction of the Bāgmatī and Kesāvatī and who also ruled over
the country.^624 The Nepāla valley originally contained a lake
called Nāga Bāsa or Kālihrada, in which lived Nāga Karkoṭaka.
It was fourteen miles in length and four miles in breadth^625
The former name of Nepāla was Śleṣmātakavana.^626 The
famous temple of Paśupatinātha on the western bank of the
Bāgmatī river, is situated about three miles north west of
Kathmandu in the town of Devipatan said to have been founded
by Aśoka's daughter Cārumatī.^627 The Śaktisaṅgama Tantra
describes the country of Nepāla as placed between Jaṭeśvara
and Yoginī.^628 Sircar equates Yoginīpura with Delhi and
Jaṭeśvara with Jalpeśvara, the famous Śiva of the Jalpaiguri
district in North Bengal.^629
Nepāla was a buffer state in the 7th century A.D. In
the 8th century A.D. she shook of its domination by Tibet.^630
According to the Deopara inscription, Nānyadeva, the ruler
of Nepāla, is said to have been defeated and imprisoned with
many other princes by Vijayasena, about the middle of the
12th century A.D.^631

and was situated in the Nellore district.^632 Law is inclined to
identify Palakkaḍa with Palakalūru in the Guntur taluka.^633

places Palakka in the Nellore district.^635 Dubreuil, however,
identifies Palakka with a capital of the same name which was
situated to the South of the Krishna and which is mentioned
in many Pallava Copper Plates.^636 The kingdom of Palakka
might have extended westwards beyond the region now occu-
pied by the districts of Auddepal and North Arcot.^637 It was

Kartṛpura’ gratified the imperious commands of Samudrgupta,
by giving all (kinds of) taxes and obeying (his) orders and
coming to perform obeisance.^639 We also find a reference to
Pratyanta in the Girnar Rock Edict No. 2. of Aśoka.^640
Law^641 contrasts between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. He
takes Pratyanta to mean the Mleccha country and quotes the
Amarakośa, Divyāvadāna, Abhidhānacintāmaṇi and Smṛti-
candrikā.^642 But in the inscription^643 the contrast is between
Dakṣināpatha and Āryāvarta while the word Āṭavikarāja
breaks the link between Āryāvarta and Pratyanta. Moreover,
all the border states mentioned in the inscription could not
have been Mleccha and inhabited by Kirātas.^644 The word
Pratyanta and its substitutes in the Aśokan edicts also refer to
the frontier states.

12. Samataṭa (No. 1, L. 22):
It is one of the frontier kingdoms which offered their sub-
mission to Samudragupta.^645 Sen^646 remarks that Samudra-
gupta reduced the king of Samataṭa to the rank of a subordi-
nate prince who had to part with most of his powers and was
‘allowed to rule over a much reduced dominion as a vassal of
the emperor’. Retaining only the control of its internal ad-
ministration, he had to pay various kinds of taxes to Samudra-
gupta, attend his durbars, render obeisance to him and gratify
his imperious commands.^647 Samataṭa is the only territory in
Bengal to be referred to in the Allahabed Praśasti.^648 The
first epigraphic reference to Samataṭa is to be found in this
inscription.^649 Literally the name means ‘the shore country’
or ‘Level country’.^650 ‘Samataṭa in the Gupta period denoted
a territory lying to the east of the Brahmaputra’. The Bṛhat-
saṃhitā mentions it as a country situated in the East.^651 The
Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang proceeded from Kāmarūpa
southwards and after a journey of 1,200 or 1,300 li (6 li-
1 mile) reached the country of Samataṭa. According to him,
this country was on the seaside and was low and moist and
was more than 3,000 li in circuit.^652 From Samataṭa, the
pilgrim journeyed towards the West for over 900 li and
reached Tanmolihti,^653 or Tāmralipta, the modern Tamluk in
the Midnāpur district.^654 Samataṭa, therefore, must have been
the South-eastern part of the Bengal presidency corresponding
to the Dacca, Faridpur, Backerganj, Jessore and Khulna
districts.^655
It is known from the Baghaura Inscription^656 that the
Tipperah district was in Samataṭa. The Ārya-Mañjuśrī Mūla-
kalpa states that Samataṭa was situated to the east of the
Lohitya.^657 The Yādavaprakāśa equates Bhaurika with
Samataṭa.^658
Epigraphical evidence, however, shows that Samataṭa com-
prised the districts of Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhat.^659 Its
capital Karmmanta has been identified with Baḍ-Kāmatā, 12
miles west of Comilla district.^660 After the rule of the Guptas,
Samataṭa was successively under the Khaḍga, Candra, Varman
and Sena dynasties.^661

आर्यावर्त|आर्यावर्त्त
1. Āryāvartta (No. 1, L. 12):
Samudragupta is stated to have violently exterminated many
kings of Āryāvarta such as Rudradeva, Matila, Nāgadatta,
Candravarman, Gaṇapatināga, Nāgasena, Acyuta, Nandin
and Balavarman.^677 We also find references to Āryāvarta in
other epigraphic records.^678
Literally Āryāvarta^679 means ‘the abode of the Āryas, or
excellent or noble people’. The word ‘Ārya’ here is significant.
It has been interpreted in two ways: some scholars derive
the word Ārya from the root §Ar, to plough, and suggest that
the Vedic Āryans were so called because they despised the
pursuits of agriculture and remained shepherds and hunters.^680
“If Ārya were purely a racial term. a more probable deri-
vation would be Ar, meaning strength or valour, from §ar
to fight, whence we have the name of the Greek war-god Ares,
areios, brave or warlike, perhaps even arete, virtue signifying,
like the Latin virtues, first physical strength and courage and
then moral force and elevation”.^681 “Intrinsically, in its most
fundamental sense, Ārya means an effort or an uprising or
overcoming. The Āryan is he who strives and overcomes all
outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human
advance.”^682 Wilson says that a variety of ancient designations
of which ‘Āria’ is a component element (cf. Ariāna) are con-
nected with the term Ārya. The Zend name for the country
to the west of the Indus was ‘Eriene-veejo’, that is the Sans-
krit Āryāvarta.^683
In defining the boundaries of Āryāvarta, Vasiṣṭha and
Baudhāyana in their Dharmasūtras lay stress on the word
Ārya and explain it to mean śiṣṭa. Patañjali also in his Mahā-
bhāṣya first explains the meaning of śiṣṭa in order to draw
attention to the cultural basis of the name Āryāvarta. He
remarks that correct conduct is found in Āryāvarta and then
mentions its boundaries.^684
In the Brāhmaṇa period the centre of Āryan culture and ci-
vilization shifted to the Gangetic Doab “Āryāvarta came to be
treated as conterminous with the region between the Gaṅgā
and Yamunā.^685 In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka^686 special honour
is assigned to those who dwell between the Gaṅgā and the
Yamunā. In the Śutra period Āryāvarta extended from the
hills of Central Rajasthan to the hills of Central Bihar.^687
At the time of Patañjali,^688 Āryāvarta was bounded on the
north by the Himalayas, on the south by Pāriyātraka, on the
west by Ādarśāvalī and on the east by Kālakavana (Rajmahal
hills) ‘Black Forest’ or rather Kanakhala, near Hardwar.^689
Thus it seems that Āryāvarta bore a sacerdotal sense and
denoted a particularly limited area where Āryan institutions
were the basis of social order.^690
What was originally called Āryāvarta was later named as
Madhya-deśa and Āryāvarta came to include the whole of
Northern India. This is related to the gradual spread of Ārya-
nism.^691 Brahmāvarta and Brahmarṣideśa lost their identity in
the Madhya-deśa and combined with Prācya, Pratīcya and
Udīcya (Uttarāpatha) became the equivalent of Āryāvarta.^692
Both Udīcya and Prācya were taken as the home (loka) of
standard Sanskrit both in Pāṇini's time and earlier. In the time
of Patañjali, Āryāvarta came to be regarded as the home of the
Śiṣṭas (persons proficient in the Śāstras) whose language set the
norm.^693
By the second century A.D., the last limit of the composi-
tion of the Manu-smṛti, the wider outlook of Āryāvarta was
popular. It was the name of the tract extending from the
Eastern to the Western Ocean, and bounded on the north and
south by the Himalaya and Vindhya respectively.^694 This is
supported by the Kāvyamīmāṃsā of Rājaśekhara.^695 Rājaśek-
hara speaks of the river Narmadā as the dividing line between
Āryāvarta and the Dakṣiṇāpatha.^696 In Inscription No. 1, L. 29
Āryāvarta is contrasted with Dakṣiṇāpatha, ‘the southern
region’.^697 The wider sense of Āryāvarta is also supported by
references in the Abhidhāna-cintāmaṇi^698 and the Rājataraṅ-
giṇī.^699

काकनादबोट
2. Kākanādaboṭa (No. 5, L. 1; No. 23, L. 2):
In both the inscriptions, we find reference to a grant to the
Ārya Saṃgha or the Community of the faithful, at the great
Vihāra, or Buddhist convent of Kākanādaboṭa,^700 for the
purpose of feeding mendicants and maintaining lamps.
D.C. Sircar takes ‘Kākanādaboṭa’ to be the old name of
Sāñcī.^701 Fleet is of the view that the Kākanādaboṭa convent
is the Great Stūpa itself. According to him the word Boṭa is
another form of Poṭa which means ‘the foundation of a
house’.^702 Fleet further writes that the name ‘Kākanāda’ lit.
‘the noise of the crow’ was the ancient name of Sāñcī itself
which is proved by its occurrence in two inscriptions in Mauryan
characters found at Sāñcī.^703
Thus, it is clear that Kākanāda was the ancient name of
Sāñcī in the Bhopal State, now Raisen district, Madhya
Pradesh, well-known for its Buddhist topes.^704 The word ‘boṭa’
is thus a surplus and joined by ‘Kākanāda’ will refer to the
great stūpa itself. Its form Poṭa meaning the foundation of a
house is untenable because the word ‘vihāra’ in that very sense
appears in the inscriptions. The word ‘boṭa’ has been used here
in the sense of an ascetic cult.^705 It is a Prakrit word which has
been used here to refer to ‘the Buddhist cult’. Thus the relevant
expression means ‘in the holy great vihāra of the Buddhist cult
(assembly) at Kākanāda’.
Fleet is wrong in translating the word Kākanāda to mean
‘the noise of the crow’.^706 K.P. Jayaswal's rendering ‘the praise
of the Kākas’^707 is more to the point. We know of the Kākas,
an autonomous community mentioned in the Allahabad In-
scription of Samudragupta.^708 In Eastern Malwa we have two
ancient place-names connected with the Kākas. One is the hill
now called Sāñcī hill (the ancient) Kākanāda. The other is an
ancient village called Kāka-pura, some 20 miles north of
Bhilsa, and full of ancient monuments.^709

A person named Śaṃkara is described in the inscription as
born in the region of the north, the best of countries, which
resembles (in beatitude) the land of the Northern Kurus.^710
The Kurus had two branches, the northern and the southern.
Uttarakuru or the country of the Northern Kurus, is supposed
to be a region beyond the most northern range of the Himālaya
mountains, and is described as a country of everlasting hap-
piness.^711 We have discussed in details, the Kurus, in the
section on tribes. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā^712 mentions it as a country
situated in the North. In the later period the Uttarakurus had
only a mythical or legendary existence.

वङ्ग
4. Vaṅga (No. 20, L. I):
In this inscription, king Candra, “on whose arm fame was
inscribed by the sword, when in battle in Vaṅga countries, is
stated to have kneaded, back with his breast the enemies who,
uniting together, came against him”.^713 This is taken by
scholars^714 to be the first epigraphic mention of Vaṅga. The
Vaṅgas here mean the ‘Vaṅga country’ the eastern Bengal of
modern times. Bajpai is of the opinion that the Vaṅgas
of the Meharaulī Pillar Inscription of Candra (No. 20) are the
people living in the Makaran coast of Baluchistan.^715 But the
Vaṅgas here denote country and not the people. Moreover, the
victory of king Candra over the Vaṅga countries has no con-
nection with his conquest of the Vāhlikas. Both are separately
mentioned in his campaign. In Sanskrit the tribal name in the
plural is regularly used to indicate the country inhabited by the
tribe.^716 The Vaṅga countries are also referred to in the
Mahākūṭa Pillar Inscription,^717 but in the inscriptions after
the 9th century A.D. the word Vaṅgāla is usually mention-
ed.^718
The earliest mention of the Vaṅgas along with the Magadhas
is in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.^719 The name is also found in the
Baudhāyana Dharma-Sūtra^720 where the Vaṅgas are mentioned
as impure people.^721 But the Drama ‘Pratijñā-Yaugandha-
rāyaṇa’ (Act II), ascribed to Bhāsa and probably not older
than the 4th century A.D., suggests that the ruling families of
Bengal were regarded as equals to those of Northern India for
intermarriage with the royal family of Mālava.^722
The people of Vaṅga are stated to have fought in the Kuru-
kshetra war^723 and, in course of his expedition Bhīṣma is said
to have defeated Samudrasena of Vaṅga.^724 The Kāśikā men-
tions Vāṅgaka to explain Pāṇini's sūtra (IV. 3. 100) denoting
loyalty of the citizen to the state.^725 Pāṇini mentions Vāṅgī
(the lady of Vaṅga Janapada) along with Avantī, Kurū and
Yaudheyī.^726 Patañjali also refers to the Vaṅgas by way of
illustration.^727 Kauṭilya makes similar references to the
country.^728 The Bhāgavata Purāṇa also mentions it as a
country.^729 Kālidāsa states that Raghu after conquering the
Sumhas,^730 defeated the Vaṅgas with his force.^731 The Kāvya-
mīmāṃsā mentions Vaṅga as a janapada situated in the east.^732
The Bṛhatsaṃhitā also mentions it in the east along with Upa-
Vaṅga.^733
According to the Mahābhārata^734 Vaṅga, son of Bali, had
established this country. The Amarakośa^735 mentions Vaṅga
as a synonym of Raṅga (lead), but lead is not available
in Bengal and is found in abundance in Malaya, Pegu and
East Indies. People in other parts of India may have received
lead through the people of East Bengal. Suśruta also uses
Vaṅga in the same sense as Amara does^736
R.C. Banerji^737, on the basis of the Ablur Inscription of the
Kalacuri king Bijjala^738 takes Vaṅga and Vaṅgāla as two dis-
tinct people or tribes. This view has been correctly refuted by
S.B. Chaudhuri^739 who concludes that Vaṅgāla was within Vaṅga
and hence was not altogether a separate geographical entity
as is maintained by some.
The confusion may be due to the fact that the geographi-
cal location of the Vaṅga country changed in different periods.
The same country Vaṅga was known as Vaṅgāla with the addi-
tion of the Prakrit suffix ‘āla’^740 which was transliterated by the
Muslims as Bangālah (pronouncing Bangāla) in their script^741
and this was changed into Bengal by the English people.
The Yādavaprakāśa equates Vaṅga with Harikeli^742 but
the Kalpadrukośa, a work of the seventeenth century states that
Śrīhaṭṭa is Harikeli.^743 The commentary of Yaśodhara on the
Kāmasūtra refers to Vaṅga as situated to the east of the
Brahmaputra.^744

गङ्गा
1. Gaṅgā (No. 1, L. 31, No. 13, L. 16):
In Inscription No. 1 Samudragupta's fame has been compared
with the pale yellow water of the river Gaṅgā, which travelling
by many paths, purifies the three worlds, flowing quickly on
being liberated from confinement in the thickets of the matted
hair of (the) god Paśupati.^1 In the Mandasor inscription of
Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana^2 it is stated that when the
river Gaṅgā was about to descend from heaven to earth, in
order to break the force of its fall, god Śiva (Paśupati) received
it in the matted hair coiled above his forehead and projecting
like a horn; its waters wandered there for a thousand years,
before they eventually reached the earth.
In Inscription No. 13, we get a reference to Gaṅgā in the
context of Skandagupta's fight with the Hūṇas, the noise of
which was heard like the roaring of (the river) Gaṅgā, making
itself noticed in their ears.^3
A.C. Woolner^4 remarked that the name Gaṅgā does not
seem to have a convincing derivation on the Āryan side. But
we do find the word in the Uṇādi affixes. The affix Gan
comes after the root Gaṃ ‘to go’ and the word Gaṅgā is
formed.^5
The earliest mention of Gaṅgā is in the Ṛgveda.^6 The name
also occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^7 and the Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka.^8 We find it also in Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya,^9 and
in Kālidāsa's Raghuvaṃśa.^10 It is mentioned many times in
the Purāṇas^11 in which a good deal of religious importance is
attached to it.^12
The Gaṅgā emerges first in the Gangotri in the district of
Garhwal and proceeds in different courses from Hardwar to
Bulandshahar and from Allahabad to Rajmahal from where it
enters Bengal.^13

Yamunā.^21 The Kālindī is also mentioned in the Śiśupālavadha

The above-mentioned inscription describes reign of Mahārāja
Suraśmicandra, a feudatory of Budhagupta, as governing over
the area between the rivers Kālindī and Narmadā.^23 This is
one of the earliest inscriptional references to the river Nar-
madā.^24 It is mentioned as Narmados by Ptolemy.^25 No ex-
press reference to the Narmadā can be traced in the Vedic
literature. But the knowledge of the river is implied in the
reference to a chief Revottaras mentioned in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.^26 We find from the Amarakośa^27 that Revā is
another name of the river Narmadā. It is likely that the
name of the chief was derived from his association with the
river.^28 The Raghuvaṃśa speaks of Mahiṣmatī as the capital
of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).^29 It has
been mentioned several times in the Mahābhārata and the
Purāṇas.^30 The Viṣṇupurāṇa says that by chanting a mantra
addressed to the Narmadā, one does not have any fear from
serpents.^31 The river rises in the Amarakaṇṭaka mountain and
falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The junction of the Narmadā
with the sea is a sacred place of pilgrimage.^32 According to
the Purāṇas it flows from a Ṛkṣvat (a part of the Vindhyan
range) though some of them refer to it arising directly from
the Vindhya itself.^33
It is stated in the Kūrma and Matsya Purāṇas that a man
who commits suicide at any tīrtha on the Narmadā or on the
Amarakaṇṭaka does not return to this world.^34 Several rivers
such as Kapilā, Viśalyā, Eraṇḍī, Ikṣunadī and Kāverī^35 are
mentioned as falling into the Narmadā.

D.C. Sircar takes Padmā to be the name of a locality in the
town of Indrapura.^38 The inscription (No. 16) also tells us
that Skandagupta's feudatory viṣayapati Śarvanāga was govern-

a tributary of the Koel in Choṭānagpur.^42 It seems that the
river was decorated with numerous Palāśa (flower) trees that
grew on its banks. The flowers falling in the river must have

the victories of king Candra who is said to have conquered the
Vāhlikas after having crossed the seven mouths of the (river)
Sindhu^50 in warfare. Sindhu in the Ṛgveda^51 and the Athar-
vaveda^52 often means simply a ‘stream’. The Ṛgveda (VIII.
24. 27) refers to ‘Sapta Sindhavaḥ’ or ‘the seven rivers’.^53 But
it is also^54 used in the more exact sense of the ‘stream’ par
excellence or ‘The Indus’. We get a reference to Sindhu as a
river in the Amara-kośa.^55 The territories adjoining it were
famous for horses^56 and salt.^57
The term Sindhu was corrupted to Hindu in the old Per-
sian inscriptions of Darius I (516-485 B.C.), and to Indus by
the Ionian (= Pāṇini's Yavana) Greeks.^58 The word ‘India’ is
derived from the river Sindhu or the Indus.^59 Taking its rise
from the snows of Western Kailāśa in Tibet, the Sindhu first
flows north-west of Kashmir and South of little Pamir, and
then takes a southward course along which lay some of the
important cities of north India. Emerging from the Darad
high-lands, the river (Dāradī Sindhuḥ) enters the Gandhāra
country until it receives its most important western tributary
the Kabul river at Ohind, a few miles north of Attock.^60
The river Sindhu is mentioned in the Purāṇas along with
the Gaṅgā, Sarasvatī, Satluj, Chinab and Yamunā.^61
Vogel suggests that the expression ‘Sindhor sapta mukhāni’
may indicate the ‘sapta sindhavaḥ’ of the Ṛgveda, i. e. the
river Indus and its tributaries. The term mukha would then
be not taken in the sense of ‘the mouth of a river’, but as
meaning a river-head.^62 But the translation of the expression
as done by Fleet (i. e. the seven mouths of the river Indus) is
generally accepted.^63 The seven mouths of the river Indus
thus represent the points of its confluence with its tributaries
and not the tributaries individually as suggested by Vogel.

सुदर्शन
10. Sudarśana (No. 14, L. 15: L. 17):
It is the name of a lake situated at some distance from
Girinagara as mentioned in the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of
Rudradāman I (A.D. 150).^64 The lake was originally cons-
tructed by the Vaiśya Puṣyagupta, the provincial governor of
the Maurya king Candragupta. Later on during the reign of
Aśoka it was adorned with conduits, by the Yavana governor
Tuṣāspha.^65 The same lake was destroyed by the excessive
floods in the Suvarṇasikatā, Palāśinī and other streams arising
from the mountain Ūrjayat.^66 By a breach, four hundred and
twenty cubits long, just as much broad, (and) seventy-five
cubits deep, all the water flowed out, so that, the lake, almost
like a sandy desert became extremely ugly to look at.^67 The
lake was immediately beautified with repairs by king Rudradā-
man.^68
Inscription No. 14 informs us that during the reign of
Gupta king Skandagupta in the year 136 (G. E.), due to heavy
continuous rains the Sudarśana lake burst out on all sides^69
and had the appearance of a sea. Eventually, contrary to the
literal meaning of its name the Sudarśana became ugly to look
at.^70 The lake was repaired in the year 137 (G. E.)^71 (= A.D.
456) by Cakrapālita, who was appointed governor of Giri-
nagara by his father Parṇadatta, who was Skandagupta's
viceroy in Surāṣṭra.^72

11. Vāṭā-nadī (No. 43, L. 22):
We get a reference to the Vāṭā-nadī in an inscription at Kalai-
kuri, Sultānpur near Naogaon, Rajshahi district, East Pakistan
now Bangla Desh. It was flowing to the east of a village
named Dhānyapāṭalikā.
‘The Vāṭā nadī appears to be the modern Bārā-nai, Singra
lying about 10 miles to the north-east of its junction with the
Atrai.^73 It flows west to east through the southern part of the
Rajshahi district^74

विलासिनी
12. Vilāsinī^75 (No. 14, L. 16):
The river comes out from the mountain Raivataka. Fleet
takes Sikatāvilāsinī as an adjective of the Palāśinī^76 but the
three, Sikatā, Vilāsinī and Palāśinī seem to be separate rivers
as we find the use of the plural number in the case which
denotes the mention of more than two rivers. Hence Vilāsinī
is the third river in the context: the other two being Pilāśinī
and Sikatā (Suvarṇasikatā).

कैलाश
1. Kailāśa (No. 17, L. 6: L. 13):
In L. 6 of the inscription the poet while giving an account of
the city of Daśapura describes its buildings as lofty like the
mountain Kailāśa itself.^77 L. 13 describes the mountain Kāilaśa
as one of the breasts of the earth (the other being Sumeru) which
was being reigned over by the Gupta king Kumāragupta.^78
Kailāśa mountain is situated about 25 miles to the north of
Māna-sarovara beyond Gangrī and to the east of the Niti
Pass.^79 The Mahābhārata^80 includes the Kumaun and Garhwal
mountains in the Kailāśa range. The mountain also known
as Hemakūṭa, Śaṃkaragiri and is to be identified with the
Aṣṭapada mountain of the Jainas.^81 It surpasses in beauty the
big Gurlā or any other of the Indian Himālaya.^82 Traditionally
it is supposed to be the habitat of Śiva and Pārvatī.^83

रैवतक
2. Raivataka (No. 14, L. 16) (the same as Ūrajayat see
Ūrjayat):
Raivataka is also mentioned in the Ādi-Parvan of the Mahā-
bhārata,^84 the Vividhatīrthakalpa,^85 the Bṛhatsaṃhitā,^86 the
Dohad Stone Inscription of Mahamūda,^87 and the Jaunpur In-
scription of Iśānavarman.^88 Its modern name Girnar was a
switch over to it from the city name Girinagara, i. e., ‘a city
on or at the foot of a hill’.^89 Raivataka derives its name
from king Revatā, the father of Revatī, (the wife of Baladeva,
Kṛṣṇa's elder brother).^90 Revata is supposed to have come
there from Dwārakā and lived on the hill. There is still a
tank called Revatī-kuṇḍa near Dāmodarakuṇḍa in the gorge
of the hill.^91 The Gujarati Sanskrit poet Māgha in the Śiśu-
pālavadha devotes the whole of Canto IV (verses 1-68) to the
description of the Raivataka mountain. In Canto VI (verses
1-79) the poet describes the occurrence of six seasons one by
one at the mountain Raivataka.

सुमेरु
3. Sumeru (No. 17, L. 13, No. 32, L. 15):
In No. 17 the mountain Sumeru is described as one of the
breasts of the earth (the other being Kailāśa) and the Gupta
king Kumāragupta is mentioned as the lord of the earth. In
No. 32 it has been named as Amarabhūdhara. Its other names
are Meru, Karṇikācala, Ratnasānu, Svargiri, Svargigiri and
Kāñcanagiri.^92
Sumeru is identified with Rudra Himālaya in Garhwal,
where the river Gaṅgā has its source, it is near Badarikāśrama.^93
According to the Matsya Purāṇa^94 the Sumeru Parvata is
bounded on the north by Uttara-Kuru, on the South by
Bhāratavarṣa, on the west by Ketumāla and on the east by
Bhadrāśvavarṣa.^95 It is also mentioned in the Padmapurāṇa.^96
and the Kālikāpurāṇa.^97 According to the Kālikāpurāṇa Śiva saw
the summit of it. We also learn from this text that the Jambu
river flows from this mountain.^98 We also find the mention of
the Meru in the Śiśupālavadha of Māgha. It was on account
of the eminence of Sumeru among the mountains that for
praising kings they were described as ‘Meru’ among kings.^99
This metaphor may have been applied after the contention of
the Purāṇas that the earth is supposed to be like lotus, with
four Mahādvīpas as its four petals and mount Meru as its
pericarp.^100

4. Ūrjayat (No. 14, L. 16):
The poet here draws a picture: the lake Sudarśana looked
like the sea^101 and the rivers Palāśinī, (Suvarṇasikatā), etc.,
had joined it has if the mountain Ūrjayat had stretched his
hand with flowers (growing on the banks of the trees and thus
falling in the rivers) for sending his daughters to their worthy
husband.^102 Since the rivers emerged out from the mountain
Raivataka, it may be called their father as described in verse
28, but to avoid repetition the poet uses in verse 29 a synonym
of its name viz., the Ūrjayat and while making it the symbol
of father represents the sea as the husband of the rivers.^103
Thus the mountains Ūrjayat and the Raivataka are one and
the same. We also get support for our suggestion from the
fact that whereas the Junāgaṛh Rock Inscription of Rudradā-
man describes the emergence of the rivers Palāśinī, Suvarṇsi-
katā etc., from the mountain Ūrjayat^104 in Inscription No. 14
the name of Raivataka is used in the same context.^105 Fleet^106
and Sircar^107 are wrong in describing Raivataka as a hill diff-
erent from Ūrjayat or Girnar situated opposite to it. The
Vividhatīrthakalpa also uses the names Raivataka and the
Ujjayant (Ūrjayat) as synonyms for Girinara which was sancti-
fied by Śrīnemi and is situated in Surāṣṭra (South Kathia-
wad).^108 In another inscription at Girnār (about 15th century)
verses 5-8 refer to the mountain Girnār by both the names
Ujjayanata and Raivata.^109 The Abhidhānacintāmaṇi of
Hemacandra also mentions Ujjayanta and Raivataka as
synonyms.^110 The Kap copper-plate of Keṭadi Sadāśiva-Nāyaka
also refers to Ujjantagiri (Ūrjayat).^111 The mountain Ūrjayat
is identified with Girnar hill near Junāgaṛh.^112 The literal
meaning of Ūrjayat is strong, powerful, eminent.^113

5. Viṣṇupada (No. 20, L. 6):
We know from the inscription that a lofty standard of the
divine Viṣṇu was set up on the hill called Viṣṇupada.^114 Liter-
ally meaning ‘the hill marked with footprints of Viṣṇu’, Viṣṇu-
pada hill has been identified with that part of the Delhi Ridge
on which the column stands.^115 But there is no mountain in
Delhi and the inscription appears to have been brought there
from the mount Viṣṇupada.^116 On the evidence from the
Epics, this Viṣṇupada hill is not far from Kurukshetra and the
Beas.^117
