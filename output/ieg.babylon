चाट
Cāṭa
(HD), irregular soldiers according to Fleet and 
Bühler. Vogel (Ant. Ch. St., pp. 130-32) points out that 
Chamba is the only place where the ancient word Cāṭa is still 
extant in the modern form Cāḏ meaning ‘the head of a Parganā’. 
An important privilege of a gift village was ‘not to be entered 
by Cāṭas and Bhaṭas’. Inscriptions (Ep. Ind., Vol. XI, 
p. 221) often specify that the granted land was not to be entered 
by Cāṭas and Bhaṭas except for seizing robbers and those guilty 
of harm or treason to the king (cf. a-cāṭa-bhaṭa-praveśyaṃ cora- 
drohaka-varjam in op. cit., Vol. VIII, p. 287). Sometimes we 
have bhaṭa-cāṭa-sevak-ādīn (Ep. Ind., Vol. IV, p. 211) and 
caṭṭa-bhaṭṭa-jātīyān janapadān (ibid., Vol. XIV, p. 160). 
(IE 8-3;
CII 3, 4), generally mentioned along with 
bhaṭa; sometimes replaced by cāra (spy) and chātra (literally, 
‘umbrella-bearer’, but really, a constable, i. e. a Pāik or Piāda);
probably indicates the leader of a group of Bhaṭas, i. e. Pāiks 
and Piādas; a policeman leading a group of Pāiks. See caṭṭa. 
Yājñavalkya, I. 336, speaks of the duty of the king to 
protect people from the harassment caused by cāṭas, robbers 
and Kāyasthas and the Mitākṣarā explains cāṭa as persons 
who deprive people of their wealth after creating false confi
dence in them. According to Bṛhaspati quoted by Aparārka, 
‘dangers common to all are those arising from the cāṭas and 
thieves’. The word cāṭa in the passage tārkika-cāṭa-bhaṭa-rāj- 
āpraveśya in Śaṅkara's Bhāsya on the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 
is explained by Ānandagiri by saying that the cāṭas are those 
that transgress the rules of conduct for decent people and that 
bhaṭas are servants telling falschood (Ep. Ind., Vol. IX, p. 296). 
But cāṭa is used in inscriptions in the sense of a royal official.
