उलूपी
Ulūpī f.: A Nāga princess (पन्नगी
1. 206. 18; भुजङ्गमा 1. 206. 23).
A. Early life: Daughter of Nāgarāja
Airāvata (daughter not named here, but appa-
rently identical with Ulūpī); married first to
a नाग who was killed by Suparṇa; she had
no child; next, given by her father as wife
to Arjuna 6. 86. 6-8; her son Irāvant called
a दायाद of Arjuna 6. 86. 11; yet Irāvant
described as the son fathered by Arjuna on
the wife of another person (परक्षेत्र) 6.
86. 11 [apparently परक्षेत्र here intended
to mean that Ulūpī was a widow when married
to Arjuna; no mention in this narration of
Ulūpī's amorous advance (साहस) to Arjuna
1. 206. 17.]
B. Meeting with Arjuna:
described in the अर्जुनवनवासपर्वन् 1.
2. 91 = 1. 206; she saw Arjuna while bathing
in Gaṅgā; fell in love with him and dragged
him into water; on enquiry she told Arjuna
she was the daughter of the serpent (पन्नग)
Kauravya born in the family of Airāvata; she
requested Arjuna to make her happy by
uniting with her; she pleaded that he would
not thereby violate his vow to observe
celibacy for twelve years since, by uniting
with her, he would be offering protection to
the distressed and would be saving her life;
Arjuna agreed to her request 1. 206. 13-33
[No mention in this narration of Arjuna's
marrying her].
C. Role in Arjuna's battle
with Babhruvāhana: Ulūpī enraged when
Arjuna rebuked her ‘son’ Babhruvāhana for
not offering a fight; she who was versed in the
duties of a Kṣatriya (क्षात्रधर्मविशारदा
14. 78. 10), therefore broke open the earth and
appeared on the scene; she introduced herself
to Babhruvāhana as his mother and asked him
to fight with Arjuna 14. 78. 8-13; Citrāṅgadā,
mistaking Arjuna and Babhruvāhana to be
dead when they fell unconscious on the
ground in the armed conflict that followed,
scolded Ulūpī for inciting Babhruvāhana to
offer a fight; she requested Ulūpī to bring
Arjuna to life, not minding the death of
Babhruvāhana 14. 79. 2-7, 12-17; Babh-
ruvāhana, on gaining consciousness scolded
Ulūpī for the same reason 14. 80. 13-15; Ulūpī
told Babhruvāhana that Arjuna was not really
dead but was in a swoon as she had employed
मोहिनी माया; she asked Babhruvāhana to fight
because Arjuna wanted to put his strength
to test; she then thought of the सङ्जीवन
मणि and asked Babhruvāhana to place it
on Arjuna's chest to bring him back to
consciousness 14. 81. 2, 4-7, 9-10; Arjuna,
when revived, asked Ulūpī the reason for her
presence on the battle-field 14. 82. 1-4; she told
Arjuna that what she did was for the atonement
(निष्कृति) and pacification (शान्ति) through his
son for his sinful act in felling down Bhīṣma in
an unlawful way (अधर्मेण) 14. 82. 8-11;
when Bhīṣma fell, Vasus cursed Arjuna, where-
upon Ulūpī requested her father to intercede on
behalf of Arjuna; Ulūpī's inciting Babhru-
vāhana was to release Arjuna from that curse;
Arjuna expressed satisfaction at what Ulūpī
had done 14. 82. 15-22; Arjuna invited
Babhruvāhana to attend the Aśvamedha
with his two mothers (Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā)
and took leave of his wives 14. 82. 24, 32.
D. Later life and End: She was one of those
who waited on Gāndhārī 15. 1. 21; Sāmba, a
Brāhmaṇa assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra on behalf of
his subjects that neither Kuntī, nor Draupadī,
nor Ulūpī, nor Subhadrā would do anything
harmful to the people 15. 16. 20; she entered

inviting for help and saw him lying in coils in
a forest fire; he introduced himself as Nāga
Karkoṭaka; he once seized (?प्रलब्ध) a
Brahmanical sage and, due to his curse, was
since unable to move; agreed to become
Nala's friend and, if saved by Nala,
assured to teach him something which
would stand him in good stead (श्रेयः);
Karkoṭaka could change his size at will and
become of the size of a thumb; he asked
Nala to take him some distance and
while doing so count his steps; Nala picked
him up and took him to a place where there
was no fire; at the tenth step (दशमे
पदे) he bit Nala when, apparently, Nala
must have uttered the word दश (which
was also a command to bite); as a result Nala
became deformed (विकृत); Karkoṭaka as-
sumed his natural form and advised Nala to
go to king Ṛtuparṇa of Ayodhyā; Karkoṭaka
changed Nala's appearance so that no one
should recognize him; he gave Nala two pieces
of cloth and asked him to put them on,
after remembering Karkoṭaka, to regain his
original form 3. 63. 1-24; the piece of cloth
was free from dust (वस्त्रम् अरजः), and
when Nala did, as advised, he regained his
original form 3. 75. 17; Kali who had entered
Nala's body was all along burning due to the

in Nala's body; when Kali came out of Nala's

गरुड
Garuḍa, Garutmant, Tārkṣya, Vaina-
teya, Suparṇa m.: A mythical bird.
A. Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73
the origin is narrated in the Āstīkaparvan;
mind-born (संकल्पज) son of Kaśyapa and
Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vaina-
teya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatā-
sūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39;
1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two
eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot (सोपस्-
वेद भाण्ड) for over a thousand years; as
advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not
break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20;
when the proper time came Garuḍa came out
of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as
soon as born he left the mother and flew up
in the sky, from there to seek his destined
food (serpents, hence पन्नगसूदन) 1. 14.
22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among
the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62;
(1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the
penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once
Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they
offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra
for gods who would be a hundred times more
powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27.
8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajā-
pati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that
the one to be born as a result of their
sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1.
27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated
as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a
boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by
their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma
13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa
was of big size (महाकायः), having
blazing lustre and looking like a mass of
kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought
him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni
not to burn the people; they were informed
by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa,
Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and
sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa with-
drew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14.
B. Progeny:
Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya)
Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the
lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of
Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1;
these six are thus the founders of the विनता-
कुल 5. 99. 3.
C. Eminence: Garuḍa com-
pared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said
that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13.
14. 158; as the best among the birds he was
counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6.
32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the
birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought
highly of other birds whenever he con-
fronted them 6. 4. 34.
D. Bringer of अमृत
(Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa
approached his mother who, as the slave of
Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean;
at her instance Vainateya carried on his
back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted
due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when
revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa
carried them to a beautiful forest in an island,
and from there to another island 1. 23. 1,
6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do
whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing
the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked
serpents how his mother could be freed from
slavery; serpents asked him to get अमृत for
them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his
expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he
might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the
Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him
never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told
Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the
time of his departure he was blessed by
Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak
and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14;
a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got
into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa
opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his
wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the
Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he
met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he
was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; अमृत
1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might
eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka,
(an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise),
both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25.
7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and
the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived
in the south and used to fight with each other)
with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and
sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch
gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25.
27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to
save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya
1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew
around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went
to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana
mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas
that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest
of the living beings; they left the branch;
Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked
Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from
Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch;
as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited
mountain covered with snow and there ate the
elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as
Garuḍa drew near the place of अमृत,
there were bad omens for gods; when Indra
enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that
Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26.
36-37 (called also अमृत 1. 26. 38); Bṛhas-
pati told the gods that Garuḍa was of in-
comparable strength and would achieve what
was most difficult to achieve (असाध्यम् अपि
साधयेत्) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart
1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28.
20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of
Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were
protecting अमृत (1. 28. 6), an with birds
(पक्षिन्) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others;
he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought
with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after
the fight Garuḍa saw अमृत surrounded
by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety
times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers,
poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter
the fire he became small in size 1. 28.
22-25; near the अमृत he saw a wheel
of iron (अयस्मय), of sharp edge, which
was a device (यन्त्र) created by gods to
cut down those who might try to steal
Soma; as he entered through the spokes
of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poi-
son in their eyes (चक्षुर्विषौ), guard-
ing अमृत; anyone seen by them would be
reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes
with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya)
snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with
the force of his speed he uprooted (उन्मथ्-)
the यन्त्र 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not
taste the अमृत but asked a boon from Viṣṇu
that he should become undecaying and im-
mortal without tasting अमृत 1. 29. 11, 14;
without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa,
as he was taking away अमृत, with his वज्र;
to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from
whose bones the वज्र was fashioned, the वज्र
itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather
from his wings, as though due to the stroke
of वज्र, but otherwise was not affected
by the वज्र 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather
of excellent form all beings (सर्वभूतानि)
said “may this bird be Suparṇa” (सुरूपं
पत्रम् आलक्ष्य सुपर्णो ऽयं भवत्व् इति)
1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship,
and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1
(Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's
birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1.
27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return
Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of
taking it away; both hatched a plan—
Indra was to take away अमृत once Garuḍa
had placed it before the serpents and freed his
mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra
granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose ser-
pents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his
epithets like पन्नगाशन 2. 22. 23; 5. 110.
5, 15; 5. 117. 23; पन्नगसूदन 1. 14.
22; भुजगेन्द्रारि 5. 110. 1; भुजगारि 10.
13. 4); Garuḍa brought अमृत to serpents and
placed it for them on the कुश grass; he asked
them to take it after they had bathed and
become auspicious (मङ्गलसंयुक्ताः); he
asked serpents to free his mother from slavery
from that day; the serpents agreed and went
to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to
roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the for-
est and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa,
Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that
Garuḍa would free Vinatā from slavery 1.
14. 18); फलश्रुति: One who hears or recites
this narrative (कथा) will go to heaven due
to his glorifying Garuḍa, the lord of the birds
(पतगपति) 1. 30. 22.
E. Gālava epi-
sode: Gālava was asked by his teacher Viśvā-
mitra to give him as दक्षिणा eight hundred
moon-like white horses, each having a black ear
on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to
procure these, Gālava desired to take recourse
to Viṣṇu; just then Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja),
the friend of Gālava, appeared before him and
offered to take him to any place 5. 105.
14-19; Suparṇa described to Gālava the four
directions 5. Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava
the etymology of the name of the direction
उत्तरा (यस्माद् उत्तार्यते पापात् ‘because one
is freed there from sin’ 5. 109. 1; also गुणैर्
अन्यैर् दिग् उत्तरा ‘a direction superior (to
others) in different qualities’, and सर्व-
कर्मसु चोत्तरा ‘better (than other direc-
tions) for performing all rites’ 5. 109. 24);
Gālava requested Garuḍa (named variously
as Garutmant, Suparṇa, Vinatātmaja,
Tārkṣya, Aruṇānuja) to take him to the east;
Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked
Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to
stand the speed of Garuḍa, Gālava requested
him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further
but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15;
Gālava told Garuḍa that his real purpose was
to obtain the eight hundred horses and since
he knew no way to obtain them he thought of
giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17;
Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with
Gālava for wanting to end his life and told
him: “The time of death is not determined
by any person, Kāla is rather supreme (न
चापि कृत्रिमः कालः कालो हि परमेश्वरः
[Nīla.: कृत्रिमः स्वेच्छासम्पाद्यः 5. 112.
20 Bom. Ed.]) 5. 110. 19-20; he told Gālava
that they would first repair to mountain Ṛṣabha
in the heart of the ocean, eat, rest, and then
return 5. 110. 22; on the peak of the Ṛṣabha
mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāh-
maṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her
and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found
himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of
wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was re-
duced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī
and had planned to take her away from that
place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī
relented and told Garuḍa that he would
be ‘Suparṇa’ again; Garuḍa got back his
wings which were stronger than before (Nīla.
द्रविणवत्तरौ = बलवत्तरौ 5. 113. 17
Bom. Ed.) 5. 111. 17; Śāṇḍilī advised Garuḍa
not to despise women at any time even if they
deserved to be despised (न च ते गर्हणीयापि
गर्हणीयाः स्त्रियः क्वचित् 5. 111. 16) 5. 111.
1-17; when Viśvāmitra, on his way, saw
Gālava without the horses he had asked for,
he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya
and said he would further wait for a period
of the same duration as before; Suparṇa,
having heard what Viśvāmitra had said,
explained to Gālava the importance of gold
and wealth (he told him the etymology of the
word धन: धत्ते धारयते चेदम् एतस्मात्
कारणाद् धनम् 5. 112. 2) and took him to
his friend, king Yayāti, for getting wealth to
purchase the required horses; when they met
Yayāti, Garuḍa (विनतासुत) requested him
on Gālava's behalf to part with some wealth;
Garuḍa assured Yayāti that Gālava in return
would give him a part of his तपस्; Garuḍa
told Yayāti that since he was qualified to
give a gift and Gālava to receive it his
giving gift to Gālava would be like pouring
milk in a conch shell (शङ्खे क्षीरम् इवा-
सक्तम् 5. 112. 20) 5. 111. 18-23; 5. 112.
1-20; Yayāti listened to what Suparṇa had
said; he was delighted to meet Tārkṣya, his
friend; but Yayāti told him that he was no
longer wealthy; however as it was not meet to
frustrate the hopes of a विप्रर्षि, he was pre-
pared to part with his daughter Mādhavī by
marrying whom to some king Gālava could
acquire wealth as bride price (शुल्क) to buy
the horses; Garuḍa having shown the way to
Gālava to acquire the horses left him and
went to his residence 5. 113. 1-16; when
Gālava had procured six hundred out of the
eight hundred required श्यामकर्ण horses, he
met Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) again 5. 116. 21;
Garuḍa (Vainateya) heard Gālava's story;
he (Suparṇa) told Gālava that he would never
find more than six hundred horses as, before
him, Ṛcīka did not get more than six hundred
horses; Garuḍa advised Gālava to give
Mādhavī to Viśvāmitra in lieu of the remain-
ing two hundred horses; Suparṇa then took
Gālava, Mādhavī and the six hundred horses
to Viśvāmitra; Gālava was thus able to pay
the दक्षिणा his teacher had demanded with the
help of Suparṇa; Gālava permitted Suparṇa to
leave 5. 117. 1-23.
F. Sumukha (a serpent)
episode: Serpent Āryaka told Mātali who
wanted his daughter to be married to Sumukha
that Cikura, his son, was killed by Vainateya
and that the same fate awaited his grand-son
Sumukha in a month's time; Mātali assured
Āryaka that he would endeavour to mitigate
the threat of Suparṇa to Sumukha; when
they all approached Indra, Viṣṇu asked
Indra to give अमृत to Sumukha and make
him immortal; Indra, remembering the pro-
wess of Vainateya, was reluctant to part
with अमृत and asked Viṣṇu himself to give
it to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again,
Indra gave only long life to Cikura
but not अमृत 5. 102. 14-27; 5. 101. 24.
G. Association with Viṣṇu: (1) As
standing on his flag-staff and as his vehicle:
While fetching अमृत from heaven, Vaina-
teya met Viṣṇu on way; when offered a boon
by Viṣṇu, Garuḍa chose that he should stay
above Viṣṇu (तव तिष्ठेयम् उपरि); when
Garuḍa in return offered a boon to Viṣṇu,
he chose Garuḍa to serve him as his vehicle
(वाहन), and since Garuḍa wanted to stand
above him Viṣṇu asked Garuḍa to stand on his
flag-staff (ध्वजं च चक्रे) 1. 29. 12-16;
hence after the death of Jarāsandha when
Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa (Garutmant), he
instantly appeared and took his seat on (the
flag-staff of) the chariot; the flag-staff then
appeared as a raised चैत्य post 2. 22. 22-
23; Kṛṣṇa's flag marked with Garuḍa when
he started for Hāstinapura 5. 81. 20; when
Dāruka brought Kṛṣṇa's chariot for the use of
Sātyaki it was marked with Suparṇa 7. 122.
43; also 7. 56. 33 (Vainateya); when Kṛṣṇa
got his chariot ready to pursue Aśvatthāman,
Vainateya stood on the flag-staff 10. 13. 4;
when, at the end, the Vṛṣṇis were helplessly
looking on, Suparṇa on the flag of Kṛṣṇa was
taken away day and night by the Apsaras 16.
4. 5; Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) is called गरुडध्वज
7. 57. 2; 13. 11. 5; 13. 135. 51; सुपर्ण-
केतु 3. 173. 15; तार्क्ष्यकेतन 2. 2. 12;
12. 48. 14; तार्क्ष्यप्रवरकेतन 2. 42.
55; तार्क्ष्यध्वज 8. 27. 65; (also cf. 12.
46. 34); तार्क्ष्यलक्षण 12. 43. 8; Kṛṣṇa
used Vainateya as his vehicle while fetching
Pārijāta from Amarāvatī 7. 10. 22; he used
Tārkṣya as vehicle while going to Himavant
to propitiate Śiva 13. 14. 26 and Vainateya
while waiting on him 13. 14. 142; Garuḍa
felt he was disregarded by Indra because he
stood on the flag of Indra's younger brother
and because he carried him (Kṛṣṇa) on his
back and was thus reduced to the state of a
servant 5. 103. 13, 8; Viṣṇu asked Garutmant
to bring king Vasu Uparicara from Pātāla
and make him a खेचर 12. 324. 30-35;
(2) Removal of Garuḍa's pride: When
Garuḍa knew that Indra had granted long life
to the serpent Sumukha he blamed Indra for
depriving him of his food; he threatened to
give up his life and said that as long as Indra
was there he had nothing to do with Viṣṇu
(न विष्णुः कारणं मम) 5. 103. 1-17;
Viṣṇu scolded Garuḍa (Tārkṣya, Garutmant)
for praising himself although in reality he was
very weak; Viṣṇu told Garuḍa that he did not
really carry Viṣṇu but Viṣṇu carried himself
and also Garuḍa (अहम् एवात्मनात्मानं
वहामि त्वां च धारये 5. 103. 20); how-
ever he asked Garuḍa to carry only his right
arm, and when the arm was placed on Garuḍa
he fell down under its weight and became
almost unconscious (विचेताः); he shed many
feathers; Viṣṇu did not deprive him of his
life; finally Garuḍa bowed down to Viṣṇu
and begged for forgiveness 5. 103. 18-30.
H. Association with Śeṣa: Śeṣa complained
to Pitāmaha that his dull-witted brothers
(serpents) hated their brother (cousin) Vai-
nateya and he in turn hated them 1. 32.
10-11; Pitāmaha then made Garuḍa
(Suparṇa, Vainateya) a friend of Śeṣa 1. 32.
25.
I. Association with Skanda: Suparṇa
gave Skanda a feather and a peacock as toy
(क्रीडनीय) 13. 86. 20-21; he gave peacock
to Skanda 9. 45. 46; he attended Skanda's
consecration as general of the army 9. 44.
14; some of the warriors of Skanda were
Garuḍa-faced (गरुडाननाः) 9. 44. 79.
J. Garuḍa's other feats: (1) Suparṇa
swallowed a quail which, however, was
freed by Aśvinau 1. 3. 62; (2) Garut-
mant often went to the mountain Himavant
12. 314. 6; Suparṇa once carried away
forcibly the big snake Ṛddhimant living
near a lake on the Gandhamādana mountain;
the wonderful feat (अद्भुतम्) was witnessed
by the Pāṇḍavas 3. 157. 14-15; (3) A ser-
pent (not named), husband of the daughter
of Airāvata, killed by Suparṇa 6. 86. 7;
(4) Suparṇa (and Suparṇas) fought with
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who protected the fire at
Khāṇḍava; he fought with wings, beak, and
nails 1. 218. 19-20; 8. 63. 68 (नख, दशन
(? for beak); (5) During his fight with
demons (Daiteyas) he performed the great
feat of killing six of them 5. 103. 11-12.
K. Strength: Indra described Garuḍa
as a great being (महद् भूतम्) and
wished to know the extent of his strength
(1. 29. 22, 23); Garuḍa said that although
good persons did not themselves describe
their strength and virtues he would do so due
to his friendship with Indra; Garuḍa could
carry the whole earth with mountains etc.,
the worlds, even with Śakra, with only a
quill of his feather (पक्षनाडी), and this
without feeling fatigue 1. 30. 2-5; also cf.
1. 20. 10-14; 1. 26. 6-9; 5. 103. 10-11, 17.
L. Greatness: (1) Called महात्मन् 1.
28. 24; (2) Destined to be the only Indra
of all birds and was so consecrated 1. 27. 29,
35; hence he is called खगेश्वर 1. 20. 14;
खगराज् 9. 16. 57; पक्षिराज् 1. 24. 12; 1.
25. 6; 1. 27. 2; 1. 28. 1, 10, 13; 1. 96. 36;

पततां वर 3. 13. 82; 5. 112. 1; 5. 117. 3;
द्विजोत्तम 12. 324. 30-32; (3) Vainateya is
counted among the Ādityas 1. 60. 38; (4) he
moved at will (कामचारी, कामगमः)
and had any amount of strength according
to his wish (कामवीर्य); he was irresistible
(अधृष्य) and could not be killed (अवध्य)
1. 21. 1; 1. 27. 2, 3, 29; (5) Vainateya
present among those who greeted Arjuna's
birth 1. 114. 62; (6) The account of
Garuḍa is the subject matter of a Purāṇa
1. 27. 4, 3.

(खगराज्) 9. 16. 57; warriors routed by
Sātyaki took refuge with Droṇa as serpents,
frightened by पतगराज, did in holes 7. 99.
12; 1. 202. 17 (Vainateya); man is freed of
sins by seeing Gaṅgā as serpents lose poison
at the sight of Tārkṣya 13. 27. 43; [also see
the next]; (2) Based on his speed, vehe-
mence and agility: (i) arrows: speed of
arrows compared to that of Suparṇa 7. 109.

arrows: 7. 172. 22; 8. 62. 51 (?) (Suparṇa);

that of Garuḍa rushing for serpents 8. 55.
22; (5) Capacity to carry burden: Bhīma,
taking his mother and brothers on his
back, would fly like Vainateya 3. 13. 82;
(6) Lustre: Śuka flying up from Kailāsa
towards heaven had the lustre (द्युति) of
Vainateya 12. 319. 11; Sutasoma appeared
to have the lustre equal to the prowess
of Tārkṣya 8. 18. 32; (7) Formidable
appearance: Bhīma with his mace, ready to
fight with Duryodhana, looked like Garut-
mant 9. 54. 14; Bhīma and Duryodhana
fought as two Garutmants would for the flesh
of a serpent 9. 57. 23; the capital at
Khāṇḍavaprastha protected by gates known
as two winged Garuḍa (द्विपक्षगरुड-
प्रख्यैः द्वारैः 1. 199. 31); (8) Superi-
ority among birds: Bhīṣma to be the general of
the Kauravas as Suparṇa was of birds 5. 153.
13; (9) Body shape: (i) a large व्यूह
(महाव्यूह) called Garuḍa or Gāruḍa
Vyūha due to its lay-out 6. 52. 2-9;
(2) अग्निचिति of Yudhiṣṭhira's horse-sacrifice

जङ्गमा) 1. 43. 18, 22, 27, 28; 1. 44. 12;
1. 49. 1; (भुजगोत्तमा) 1. 48. 25.
A. Family: Younger sister (अनुजा
स्वसा) of Vāsuki 1. 13. 34.
B. Marriage:
She was to be given in marriage to sage Jarat-
kāru as alms (भैक्षवत्) when he came
begging (for a girl of his name); this was
originally the suggestion made by Brahmā to
gods for saving serpents and it was reported
to Vāsuki by Elāpatra 1. 34. 9-18; 1. 49. 13;
this was told again by Brahmā to Vāsuki
1. 35. 8-11; so Vāsuki kept Jaratkāru
without marrying her to any one 1. 13. 34;
1. 35. 2; when sage Jaratkāru announced his
decision to marry a girl of his name, Vāsuki
was informed of it by his serpent attendants;
Vāsuki adorned his sister, told the sage that
she had the same name as his, and assured
him to maintain her even after marriage;
sage Jaratkāru agreed to marry her; she was
given as alms (भैक्षवत्) and with due
rites 1. 42. 14-20; 1. 43. 1-4; 1. 13. 30-34,
36-37.

with his wife at the residence of Vāsuki; she
agreed to her husband's condition (समय)
not to do anything that would displease
him and that if she did he would leave her;
1. 43. 7-9; once when she had bathed after
her period she lay with her husband and
conceived a child 1. 43. 11-12; after a few
days when the sage had slept with his head
on Jaratkāru's lap the sun was about to set;
Jaratkāru awakened her husband for the
evening rites; the angered sage got ready to
leave her as his wife had displeased him; she
told him that she woke him up not out of dis-
regard but to save him from violating धर्म।
D. Concern for kinsmen: She pleaded with
the sage not to leave her until she bore him a
son as she was anxious for the welfare of her
kinsmen; the child she had already conceived
might not be a son (अव्यक्तरूपं गर्भम्
1. 43. 36); the sage thereupon assured his
wife that she would give birth to a fire-like,
learned son 1. 43. 13-39; Jaratkāru informed
her brother Vāsuki about the sudden departure
of her husband; Vāsuki was scared but Jarat-
kāru told him about the assurance her husband
gave her and that he had never told a lie be-
fore 1. 44. 1-13.
E. Birth of Āstīka: Vāsuki
honoured his pregnant sister in all ways,
and at proper time Jaratkāru gave birth to a
child of divine lustre (देवगर्भाभ) 1. 44.
15-17; he was named Āstīka 1. 44. 20; 1. 13.
37.
F. Snake sacrifice: Vāsuki, terrified
at the destruction of snakes in the snake
sacrifice of Janamejaya, went to Jaratkāru
and reminded her of the purpose for which
she was married to sage Jaratkāru; he asked
her to tell her son Āstīka to intervene and
stop the snake sacrifice 1. 48. 20-26; Jarat-
kāru informed Āstīka why she was married
to his father and asked him to stop the
sacrifice 1. 49. 1-16; Āstīka assured Jarat-
kāru that he would fulfil the purpose of his
birth 1. 49. 17; on completing his mission
Āstīka informed his mother (and Vāsuki)
what had happened at the snake sacrifice 1.
53. 17.
G. Reward: Since Jaratkāru
saved the life of snakes her name appeared
in the मन्त्र to be recited for obtaining
protection from serpents 1. 53. 22.

जरिता
Jaritā f.: A female शार्ङ्ग bird
(शार्ङ्गिका, शार्ङ्गी 1. 220. 16; 1. 222. 16).
Lived in the Khāṇḍava forest 1. 220. 19;
sage Mandapāla turned himself into a शार्ङ्ग
bird and became united with Jaritā; he begot on
her four sons 1. 220. 16-17; when Mandapāla
left his sons, still in the form of eggs, and went
to Lapitā, another शार्ङ्ग female, Jaritā was
very much worried out of her affection for the
young ones 1. 220. 17-18; she did not aban-
don the eggs and when they were hatched, she
reared them as a bird would do (स्ववृत्या)
1. 220. 19; when the Khāṇḍava forest was
on fire she was distressed and lamented for her
sons who had then not developed feathers, or
feet; she did not have strength enough to fly
to a safe place taking all the young ones with
her; she did not know whom to abandon and
whom not; she therefore told her children that
she would cover them under her wings and
die with them 1. 221. 1-7; but the young ones
suggested to her to abandon them and save her-
self from fire 1. 221. 12; she then advised them
to enter the hole of a mouse under a tree which
she would cover with earth; when the fire sub-
sided she would return and remove the earth
1. 221. 15-17; the young ones hesitated for the
fear of the mouse; Jaritā tried to remove the
fear by telling them that the mouse had been
already picked up by a hawk (श्येन); the
young ones were still sceptical; she once again
told them that when the hawk took the mouse
she flew behind the hawk and blessed him to
be golden when he went to heaven for he had
taken off the enemy of the birds 1. 222. 5-8;
the young birds remained firm in their resolve
not to enter the hole and asked their mother to
fly away to a safe place; Jaritā then left her
sons to their fate and flew away 1. 222. 10-
16; when the fire had moved away from that
place Jaritā, coveting her sons, returned and
seeing them safe tears came to her eyes again
and again; she could not believe that they
were safe 1. 224. 17-19; Mandapāla also
remembered Jaritā and his sons and wondered
what might have happened to them in the fire
1. 224. 3-5; Lapitā, the other शार्ङ्गिका, en-
vious of Jaritā asked Mandapāla to go to her
for whom he was in anguish 1. 224. 11-13;
Mandapāla met Jaritā and his sons, but the
sons would not talk to him; Jaritā, too,
asked Mandapāla what business he had with
the young birds and told him to return to the
young and sweet smiling Lapitā 1. 224. 21-
25; Mandapāla blamed Jaritā for her distrust
1. 224. 26-31, but also acknowledged her being
conversant with धर्म (धर्मज्ञता)
1. 225. 2; when all were reconciled Manda-
pāla took his wife (भार्या) Jaritā and the
sons with him and left for another country
1. 225. 4.

जरितारि
Jaritāri m.: A young शार्ङ्ग bird

222. 17-18).
Eldest son of sage Mandapāla (turned
into शार्ङ्ग bird) and शार्ङ्गी Jaritā; as the
eldest son, he was considered by his father to be
the mainstay of the family (जरितारौ कुलं
हीदं ज्येष्ठोत्वेन प्रतिष्ठितम्) 1. 221. 8,
9; at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire he and
his brothers advised their mother to abandon
them and fly to a safe place 1. 222. 4, 10-14;
they in turn were advised by their mother to
enter the hole of a mouse but they hesitated 1.
221. 18-21; 1. 222. 2-4, 10-12; they preferred
to enter fire, but if saved would be united
with their mother 1. 222. 15; when the fire
drew near Jaritāri addressed himself to his
younger brothers and told them how an in-
telligent person behaved in hour of difficulty
1. 223. 1-2; he folded his hands and on
behalf of all of them praised god Agni who
was burning the Khāṇḍava 1. 222. 18; 1.
223. 7-8; when all the brothers in turn had
praised Agni, the god informed them that
he had already agreed to their father's
request to spare them 1. 223. 22; they were
seen by their mother safe from the fire 1. 224.
18-19; when Mandapāla returned to them
they did not greet him, nor spoke to him
1. 224. 20-23; later all were reconciled to
their father (1. 224. 32) and went with him
and their mother to a different country (1.
225. 4); all brothers described as ‘sages’
(ऋषि) and ‘knowers of ब्रह्मन्’ 1. 224. 8; 1.
225. 3; as ‘full of lustre’ (तेजस्विन्) and
‘heroic’ (वीर्यवन्त्) 1. 224. 8; 1. 225. 2; as

जाम्बवती
Jāmbavatī f.: A female bear.
Daughter of the bear-king Jāmbavant
(कपीन्द्रपुत्री 13. 14. 24), one of the wives
of Kṛṣṇa, mother of Sāmba; also called the
daughter of the king of the Vidyādharas 13.
14. 25; described as सुमध्यमा (13. 14.
19) and called देवी (13. 14. 19; 16. 8. 71);
twelve years after Pradyumna had killed
Śambara and after seeing the eight sons of
Rukmiṇī, Jāmbavatī approached Kṛṣṇa and
requested him to bless her quickly with a son,
heroic, handsome, and equal of himself (आत्म-
तुल्यं मम सुतं प्रयच्छाच्युत मा
चिरम्) 13. 14. 12-14; the son was to be strong
and of agreeable valour (चारुविक्रम) like
the sons of Rukmiṇī 13. 14. 18; Kṛṣṇa agreed
to her request; she then permitted Kṛṣṇa to go
to propitiate Śiva for this purpose 13. 14. 19;
at the time of Kṛṣṇa's departure she pronoun-
ced benediction (स्वस्त्ययन) on him for his
safety 13. 14. 20-24; (Śiva granted Sāmba to

तक्षक

A. Birth and family: One of the sons
(very likely the fourth son) of Kadrū (and
Kaśyapa), hence called काद्रवेय 1. 31. 5,
2; 1. 59. 40 (placed third); 1. 3. 144; his
youngest brother (जघन्यज) was Śrutasena
1. 3. 146; his son Aśvasena (1. 218. 5) was
his constant companion 1. 3. 145; (by तक्षक-
पुत्र 8. 65. 39 Aśvasena is probably alluded
to); his daughter Jvālā married to Ṛkṣa born
in the line of Pūru 1. 90. 24; serpents belong-
ing to his कुल, Pucchaṇḍaka and others, listed
by Sūta among those offered in the snake
sacrifice of Janamejaya 1. 52. 7-9; Takṣaka
also named among the serpent-sons of Surasā
and Kaśyapa 5. 101. 9, 4, 17.
B. Residence:
Lived in Bhogavatī Purī in the southern direc-
tion; he, with Vāsuki, protected it 5. 107. 19;
5. 101. 9; he had his abode (निवेशन) also in
the Khāṇḍava forest where Asura Maya happ-
ened to stay at the time of the great fire 1.
215. 7; 1. 219. 35; Uttaṅka, in his praise of
the नागस्, referred to Takṣaka as living in
Khāṇḍava near Kurukṣetra, along the river
Ikṣumatī 1. 3. 142-146.
C. Status: Second
only to Vāsuki according to an enumeration
based on eminence (यथाश्रेष्ठान्) 5. 101. 8;
called the king of the serpents नागराज 1. 3.
119, 120, 166; सर्पराज 1. 218. 4; chief of
serpents नागेन्द्र 1. 38. 34; 1. 39. 3; पन्न-
गेन्द्र 1. 38. 33, 35 etc.; best among ser-
pents पन्नगोत्तम 1. 37. 13, 19, etc.; भु-
जगोत्तम 1. 48. 15, 18; पन्नगश्रेष्ठ 1.
38. 32, 36; 1. 40. 3; उरगसत्तम 1. 39. 16;
however Uttaṅka called Takṣaka पन्नगा-
धम 1. 3. 188.
D. Description: He
was of blazing lustre (तिग्मतेजस्), his poison
acted like fire and burnt the being he bit
(आशीविष) 1. 37. 13; lotus-coloured (पद्म-
वर्चस्) 1. 40. 3; he was called by Uttaṅka
and Janamejaya ‘evil-minded’ (दुरात्मन् 1.
46. 36, 40; दुष्टान्तरात्मन् 1. 3. 185, 187),
and by Janamejaya ‘sinful’ (पाप) 1. 46. 37.
E. Khāṇḍava incident: Since Takṣaka lived
in the Khāṇḍava forest, whenever god Fire
tried to burn it, Indra, being Takṣaka's
friend, he immediately extinguished the fire
1. 215. 7; when the forest was finally on
fire, Takṣaka was not in Khāṇḍava but
was safe at Kurukṣetra 1. 218. 4; Indra
was informed of this by an invisible
voice 1. 219. 12-13.
F. Takṣaka and the
कुण्डलस्: Uttaṅka informed by Pauṣyaś
wife (क्षत्रिया) while handing over her ear-
rings to him that Takṣaka coveted them;
Uttaṅka assured her that Takṣaka would not
be able to attack him 1. 3. 119-120; Tak-
ṣaka assumed the form of a naked mendi-
cant (नग्न श्रमण) and followed Uttaṅka
on way; he took the कुण्डलस्, placed by
Uttaṅka on the ground, and ran away; when
caught by Uttaṅka, Takṣaka assumed his
original form and suddenly entered a big hole;
on reaching नागलोक he entered his residence
(स्वभवन); Uttaṅka went behind him
1. 3. 136-138; when the नागलोक was filled
with smoke issuing from the anus of a horse
(really god Agni) the confused Takṣaka,
frightened by the heat of fire, returned the
कुण्डलस् to Uttaṅka 1. 3. 158-159; when
asked by the teacher the cause for delay in
getting the कुण्डलस्, Uttaṅka told him the
hindrance caused by Takṣaka 1. 3. 165-166;
angered by this incident Uttaṅka started for
Hāstinapura to take revenge on Takṣaka
1. 3. 177.
G. Death of Parikṣit: Due to
the curse pronounced by Śṛṅgin king Parikṣit
was destined to die within a week due to
the burning lustre of the eminent serpent
Takṣaka 1. 37. 13-14, 19; 1. 46. 8-10;
Śṛṅgin's father informed Parikṣit about
his impending death at the hands of Takṣaka
1. 38. 19; 1. 46. 12-13; Kāśyapa, an eminent
sage (मुनिपुंगव 1. 38. 35), who knew the
cure for serpent bites started for Hāstinapura
to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka and acquire
wealth 1. 38. 31-33; Takṣaka, in disguise of
an aged Brāhmaṇa, met Kāśyapa on way and
asked him the reason for his hurrying on the
way; Kāśyapa told Takṣaka that he wanted
to cure Parikṣit when he would be burnt by
the fire of Taṣaka's lustre (तेजसा ऽद्य
प्रधक्ष्यति); then Takṣaka revealed his
identity and told Kāśyapa that he would not
be able to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka's bite;
Kāśyapa retorted that he was confident about
the strength of his science (विद्याबल) 1. 38.
34-39; 1. 46. 15-17; Takṣaka challenged
Kāśyapa to bring back to life a न्यग्रोध
bitten and burnt by him; this was done by
Kāśyapa by his विद्याबल 1. 39. 1-10;
astonished, Takṣaka promised to give Kāśyapa
all the wealth he desired from Parikṣit, and
even more, and begged him to return; he also
told Kaśyapa that the curse of the sage was
bound to come true, and if Kāśyapa was not
able to save Parikṣit he would lose his reputa-
tion; having received from Takṣaka the wealth
he wanted Kāśyapa turned back 1. 39. 11-19;
1. 46. 18-21; Takṣaka then started for Hās-
tinapura; on way he learnt about the arrange-
ments made to save Parikṣit with the help of
मन्त्रस् and medicines which worked as cures
for poison (मन्त्रागदैर् विषहरैः 1. 39.
21); Takṣaka planned to deceive Parikṣit with
some trick (मायायोग) and sent to the king
serpents in the disguise of hermits with fruits,
leaves, and water; when the seventh day since
the curse was uttered was about to end Pari-
kṣit felt himself secure; he found a small
worm in the fruit held by him and said (in
joke): “may this small worm turn into
Takṣaka and bite me” (कृमिको मां दशत्व्
अयम् तक्षको नाम भूत्वा वै 1. 39.
31) and put it on his neck; immediately
Takṣaka coiled around the king with his body
(भोग) 1. 39. 22-33; the ministers of the
king cried and fled; they saw a wonderful
(अद्भुत) serpent rising up in the sky 1. 40.
1-3; the whole house was on fire due to the
heat of the serpent's poison; Parikṣit died due
to the fire (तेजस्) of Takṣaka's poison 1. 40.
4-5; (छद्मेनोपेत्य तक्षकः … दग्धवान्
विषवह्निना 1. 46. 22-23).
H. Snake-
sacrifice: Uttaṅka, embittered by Tak-
ṣaka due to the obstacle put by him in
Uttaṅka's way, reported to Janamejaya how
Takṣaka was responsible for his father's
death, and instigated him to burn Takṣaka
in the fire of a सर्पसत्र 1. 3. 177-190;
when Janamejaya enquired with his mini-
sters they told him how his father was killed
by Takṣaka (1. 45. 19-28; 1. 46. 1-25);
Janamejaya again asked them how they could
know the conversation between the Panna-
gendra (i. e. Takṣaka) and Kāśyapa when,
apparently, it took place in a secluded place
in the forest; if satisfied with their expla-
nation he would think of the means to kill
the serpents (विधास्यामि पन्नगान्तकरीं
मतिम्) 1. 46. 26-27; the ministers reported
that a man happened to mount the tree
before it was burnt by Takṣaka; this man
had heard the dialogue between Takṣaka and
Kāśyapa; the man too was burnt with the tree;
when brought back to life along with the
tree the man returned to the town and
reported the incident to others 1. 46. 28-31;
Janamejaya, satisfied with this account,
decided to avenge the death of his father by
killing serpents for it was the evil-minded
Takṣaka who had offered wealth to Kāśyapa
and persuaded him not to go to Hāstina-
pura 1. 46. 35-41; Janamejaya wished to
know from his house-priest if there was any
rite by which he could get Takṣaka and his
relatives in the kindled fire; just as Takṣaka
had burnt Parikṣit by the fire of his poison
(विषाग्नि), so too Janamejaya wished to burn
the serpent; priests informed Janamejaya about
a rite known as सर्पसत्र, not performed by
any one before; thereupon Janamejaya con-
sidered Takṣaka as good as burnt in the sacri-
ficial fire 1. 47. 3-8; Takṣaka having come
to know of the सर्पसत्र went to Indra and
sought his shelter; Indra had already propitia-
ted Pitāmaha on Takṣaka's behalf and there-
fore assured Takṣaka that there was no danger
to his life from the fire of सर्पसत्र;
Takṣaka then lived happily in Indra's dwelling
1. 48. 14-18; in the meantime when the snake
sacrifice was in progress Āstīka appeared at
the place of sacrifice where serpents were
falling in the fire in large numbers; he praised
king Janamejaya; pleased, Janamejaya desired
to offer a boon to Āstīka and asked permis-
sion of the officiating priests; they gave the
permission since Takṣaka was to arrive soon;
but the होतृ priest told Janamejaya that
Takṣaka was not showing; Janamejaya asked
the priests to spare no pains and get Takṣaka
quickly; the priests told the king that as the
Śāstras informed them and as the Fire narrat-
ed to them Takṣaka, out of fear, had taken
shelter with Indra 1. 51. 1-5 (यथा शास्त्राणि
नः प्राहुर् यथा शंसति पावकः।इन्द्रस्य
भवने राजंस् तक्षको भयपीडितः); the
king's bard Lohitākṣa, who knew what had
transpired (पौराणिको वेदितवान् पुरस्तात्
1. 51. 6), confirmed what the priests had told
the king; he said that Indra had asked
Takṣaka to stay with him and feel free from
any danger from fire; Janamejaya urged his
होतृ priest to proceed and the priest with his
मन्त्रस् called Indra himself; Indra appeared
on the scene with the serpent tucked to his
उत्तरीय; Janamejaya asked the priests to make
Takṣaka fall in the fire with Indra if he sought
shelter in Indra's residence; priests told Jana-
mejaya, as they heard a thunderous roar, that
Takṣaka was coming under the king's control,
they were sure that the serpent was dropped
down by Indra and was falling from his lap,
the serpent's body was loosened by the
मन्त्रस् (मन्त्रविस्रस्तकायः 1. 51. 13)
and he had lost consciousness; they permitted
Janamejaya to grant a boon to Āstīka since
the rite was progressing according to the pres-
cription and as Takṣaka was about to fall
into the fire; Āstīka chose the boon: “let
this sacrificial session come to an end, and
let no more serpents fall (into the fire)”
(सत्रं ते विरमत्व् एतन् न पतेयुर् इहोर-
गाः 1. 51. 17); in vain did Janamejaya try
to persuade Āstīka to choose another boon;
Janamejaya agreed to stop the session and
granted freedom from risk to serpents 1.
51. 6-23; 1. 53. 8; Āstīka admitted that
Takṣaka was somehow saved because Jana-
mejaya followed the path of truth (and kept
his word) (कथंचित् तक्षको मुक्तः सत्य-
त्वात् तव पार्थिव) 15. 43. 14; Sūta called
it a great miracle of Āstīka that when Tak-
ṣaka slipped from Indra's hand, he remained
in the sky and did not drop down in the fire;
on Śaunaka's query whether Takṣaka's not
falling down from the mid-region was due to
the fact that the (suitable) मन्त्रस्
did not reveal themselves to the priests
(मन्त्रग्रामो मनीषिणाम् न प्रत्यभात्
1. 53. 4), Sūta replied that that happened
because Āstīka thrice said to the serpent
‘stay’ (तिष्ठ) 1. 53. 1-6, and Takṣaka
stayed. I. Upamāna: Bhīṣma with his sharp
weapons compared with the big serpent
Takṣaka having excess of poison (विषोल्बण)
6. 103. 15; a bow picked up by Aśvatthāman
had the lustre of the body of Takṣaka 8.
57. 60.
J. Functions and Events: (1)
mentioned among the नागस् who, without
feeling fatigue, wait on Varuṇa in his सभा;

round spots (मण्डलिन्), and hooded (फण-
वन्त्) 2. 9. 8, 10; (2) he was among those
who received the white snake issuing from the
mouth of Balarāma and entering the ocean
16. 5. 14, 12; (3) he was on the side of
Arjuna when celestial beings in the sky took
sides between Karṇa and Arjuna 8. 63. 36;

shape of Garuḍa and Takṣaka while fighting

धिपप्रभा 3. 264. 20).
B. Dutiful and
intelligent wife: She forbade Vālin from start-
ing out of their residence when he heard
Sugrīva's loud roar; from the way Sugrīva
roared, she feared he had found a protector;
since Tārā could understand the meaning of
the cries of all beings (सर्वभूतरुतज्ञा
3. 264. 19), Vālin asked her to find out whose
protection Sugrīva had secured; after contem-
plating for a while she told Vālin incidents
beginning with the abduction of Sītā upto
Sugrīva's entering into an alliance with Rāma;
she also told him about the helpers of Rāma;
in the opinion of Tārā all these helpers,
intelligent and strong, were capable of
destroying Vālin; Vālin misunderstood Tārā's
advice and doubted that she secretly loved
Sugrīva; he spoke harsh words to her and
went out 3. 264. 16-25; in the end Tārā saw
Vālin fallen on the ground.
C. Marriage
with Sugrīva: Sugrīva got Tārā, whose

of Kiṣkindhā 3. 264. 38-39.

she knew what the duties of a student and a
servant were, was familiar with the duties of
the four वर्णस्, and knew the duties of a
householder and his wife; she had learnt these
from her husband Padma; she therefore made
no mistake in receiving the guests during the
absence of her husband; on a certain occasion
she duly received and honoured a Brāhmaṇa
who arrived at Padma's residence 12. 345. 4-
12; when Padma arrived she informed him
about the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa who wanted
to meet him and had taken his residence on

the Brāhmaṇa 12. 347. 13-16; Padma's sense

he felt himself praiseworthy to have such a
virtuous wife 12. 348. 13-14, 18-19; during
Padma's absence his relatives—brothers,
sons and wife—had gone to the river Gomatī

starved himself to take some food but he did
not; they returned home without achieving
their purpose 12. 346. 1-13.

performed his duty of drawing the Sun's cha-
riot and was permitted by the god to leave;
he was then informed by his wife about
the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa; she informed
Padma that the Brāhmaṇa had asked him to
meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due
to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the
Brāhmaṇa; but on the advice of his wife he
relented and met the Brāhmaṇa; he then told
his wife that he realized that it was not in
one's interest to get angry for in bygone days,
Rāvaṇa, Kārtavīrya and his sons were killed
due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he appro-
ached the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya and asked
him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the
Brāhmaṇa first asked Padma a question; after
hearing Padma's answer, the Brāhmaṇa would
tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349.
16; the Brāhmaṇa asked Padma to tell him if
while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw
anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1;
Padma first told the Brāhmaṇa that there was
nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself
(accomplished sages and deities resort to his
rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows
from there to fill the sky; rain water is released
by his dark foot (ray ?), Śukra by name,
(शुक्रो नामासितः पादो यस्य वारिधरो
ऽम्बरे।तोयं सृजति वर्षासु 12. 350. 4);
Sun takes back the rain water with his shining
ray during eight months; the soul (आत्मा) is
for all times established in his lustre; he is the
seed of everything, movable and immovable
and the earth is sustained by him; the long-
armed, eternal, unalterable god having no
beginning and no end resides in the sun 12.
350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day
something unusual happened: while the Sun
was shining brightly at mid-day, there
suddenly appeared light in all directions, light
similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing
open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun
(द्वितीय इव भास्करः 12. 350. 11), appro-
ached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to
receive him and the other being also extended
his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then
the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15;
confused as to who was the real Sun—the one
in the chariot or the one that arrived from the
sky—Padma and others asked the Sun to
explain; the Sun told them that the one who
entered him was a sage who observed the vow
of उञ्छवृत्ति (living only on grains fallen in
the field); the sage also lived successively on
fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and
recited the ऋच् stanzas; that Brāhmaṇa (sage)
even now moved round the earth with the Sun
—this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351.
1-6; the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya, on hearing
Padma's account, took leave of him without
telling him the purpose of his visit; to the
perplexed Padma, Dharmāraṇya explained
that he was only curious to know what led to
the accumulation of merit (पुण्यसंचय);
now that he knew how one did it, he had
decided to observe उञ्छव्रत; the purpose
of his visit was served (कृतार्थो ऽस्मि) and
hence he was leaving 12. 352. 1-10.

पलित
Palita m.: A mouse.
A. Recidence: Lived in a hole, having
hundred outlets, at the foot of a banyan
tree 12. 136. 21.
B. Qualities: He
was very wise, intelligent, thoughtful, versed
in scriptures, knew how things shaped them-
selves, and the proper time for conciliation and
feud (प्राज्ञ 12. 136. 191; प्रज्ञावन्त् 12.
136. 192; महाप्राज्ञ 12. 136. 21, 26. 100;

47); according to the cat Lomaśa Palita was
Uśanas himself in intelligence 12. 136. 127.
C. Palita-Lomaśa Episode: Once when
the cat Lomaśa who lived on the branches
of the same banyan tree was caught in the
trap (उन्माथ) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla, Palita
moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh
and as he was eating it after taking it on
the top of the trap and smiling mentally
(मनसा हसन् 12. 136. 28) at his enemy,
trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy,
a mongoose by name Harika, approaching
the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita
at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an
owl named Candraka, prowling from his
nest situated on the branch of the same tree;
apprehending danger from both directions,
Palita decided to take help from the cat, his
foe in distress, and find escape from all the
three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed
himself to the cat pointing out that there was
danger to the life of both of them, that both
lived on the same tree and therefore deserved
to be friends of each other on the basis of
common residence (सवासो मे ऽसि पण्डितः
व्ल्। पण्डित 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared
to cut the cords that bound the cat provided
the cat agreed not to kill him when freed;
Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live,
and you should wish that I live” 12. 136.
48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and
asked Palita to do what was suited to the
occasion; Palita swore by truth (सत्येन ते
शपे 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net pro-
vided the cat agreed not to kill him when he
descended and crawled very close to the body
of the cat (अहं त्वानुप्रवेक्ष्यामि 12.
136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita
went near the cat and rested quietly on his
chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the
owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82;
Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of
the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish
the work quickly, Palita advised him to be
patient; Palita would complete cutting the
net only when he saw the Caṇḍāla, who had
spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat
might prove dangerous to him; if the cat,
when freed, saw the Caṇḍāla drawing near
he would immediately mount the tree and
not waste his time in jumping on the mouse;
Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136.
83-93; when the cat persisted in asking
Palita to make haste, Palita replied as
follows: “I have made treaty with one who
is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect
myself; no one has any regard for the doer of
a good act, once the act has been fully done;
hence all good acts must be done with a part
left unfinished (न हि कश् चित् कृते कार्ये
कर्तारं समवेक्षते।तस्मात् सर्वाणि
कार्याणि सावशेषाणि कारयेत् 12. 136. 105);
now only one cord remains; I shall cut down
that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107;
at dawn when the Caṇḍāla Parigha appeared,
true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord;
the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up
the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136.
109-116; when the Caṇḍāla left the scene, the
cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and
move freely among the cats without appre-
hending any danger; he asked Palita to become
his minister and even guide him like his father
(अमात्यो मे भव प्राज्ञ पितेव हि प्रशाधि
माम्) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to
oblige; he told the cat that there were no natu-
ral friends and no natural foes; hence there
were no permanent friendships and no perma-
nent enmities; friendships and enmities arise
due to certain common or conflicting interests
(नास्ति जात्या रीपुर् नाम मित्रं नाम न
विद्यते।सामर्थ्ययोगाज् जायन्ते मित्राणि
रिपवस् तथा॥नास्ति मैत्री स्थिरा नाम
न च ध्रुवम् असौहृदम्।अर्थयुक्त्या
हि जायन्ते मित्राणि रिपवस् तथा॥ 12. 136.
132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced
trust cuts at the very roots; the affection bet-
ween them arose for some purpose; once that
purpose was served, friendship lost its ground;
mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was
weak cat strong; there could be no real
conciliation (सन्धि) among parties of uneven
strength; Palita said he knew that it was the
cat's food time; that was the reason why the
cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally
told the cat that if he remembered Palita's
good act let him wish well of the mouse (शिवं
ध्यायस्व मे ऽत्रस्थः सुकृतं स्मर्यते
यदि) 12. 136. 160-166; the cat made one
more attempt to win the confidence of Palita
and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did
not relent; he recited two गाथास् of Uśanas
(apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit
of the cat the purport of which was that if one
made conciliation (सन्धि) with a person
stronger than himself to face a common enemy
he should not repose trust in his partner after
the purpose was served and that in all condi-
tions one should protect one's life since wealth
and children could be acquired if one remained
alive; Palita concluded that the sum and
substance of the नीतिशास्त्रस् was that distrust
was the best policy (सङ्क्षेपो नीतिशास्त्राणाम्
अविश्वासः परो मतः 12. 136. 187); Palita
finally told the cat that the mouse must protect
himself from the cat as the cat must protect
himself from the Caṇḍāla; the cat, apparently
scared at hearing the word ‘Caṇḍāla’, ran
to his hole and Palita entered another hole;
thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself,
outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136.
182-192.

जीवक (a bird who helps telling future ?;

a bird ? Nīla जीवजीवकः शाकुनिकः स हि
अयं पक्षी अस्यां दिशि लाभं अस्याम्
अलाभं दिशतीति वर्णयति।पक्षिविशेस इत्य्
अन्ये on 12. 139. 6 Bom. Ed.), understood
the meaning of the cries of all beings
(रुतज्ञा सर्वभूतानां यथा वै जीवजीव-
कः) 12. 137. 6.
C. Her son's death:
Her lustrous son grew in the palace with
the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the
seashore two fruits, one for her son and one
for the prince; one day the prince, while play-
ing with the young bird, killed him in a
secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with
two fruits she found her young one dead; she
lamented over her son's loss and blamed the
Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided
to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the
prince with her talons; she said that a sinful
act, deliberately committed, returned quickly
on the doer and that taking revenge did not
destroy one's good and bad (?) acts (इच्छ-
यैव कृतं पापं सद्य एवोपसर्पति।
कृतप्रतिक्रियं तेषां न नश्यति शुभा-
शुभम्) 12. 137. 7-19.
D. King Brahma-
datta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta
asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him
since she had already retaliated for the
misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree
with the king saying that wise men recom-
mended abandoning the place where misdeed
was committed; enmities, once arisen, never
subsided, hence no trust should be reposed
in the enemy; the purpose for which she
lived in the palace was no longer there;
spirited men should abandon the place
where after receiving honour they are dis-
honoured; she said to the king: “I have
lived here long enough; now I go, may you
be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded
with her saying that when some one retali-
ated nothing wrong was committed and there-
fore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did
not consent saying that enmities never passed
off (नास्ति वैरम् उपक्रान्तम् 12. 137. 34);
no one should feel secure with the thought
that reconciliation had come about; she
pointed out to the king five causes of
enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad)
speech, rivalry, and misdeed (स्त्रीकृतं
वास्तुजं वाग्जं ससपत्नापराधजम् 12.
137. 38); she lived with the king as long as
nothing wrong happened; once that happened,
she could trust the king no more; the king
then put the entire responsibility of what had
happened on Time (Kāla); since men were
driven to act by Time nobody did anything
wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī
for her act, so should she forgive him for
what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted
saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for
everything, why did men seek to take revenge ?
Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each
other ? Why did men give and take medicines
during illness ? She injured the king's son
who had killed her son; now it was the king's
turn to capture her; men wanted birds
either for eating or for sporting; there was no
third ground for the two to come together; if
Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would
be revived every time she remembered her
son; she then recited two गाथास् which
Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137.
67-68); the purport of the गाथास् was that
one who trusted the words of enemies was
killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed
in a well) covered with dry grass (ते
श्रद्दधाना वध्यन्ते मधु शुष्कतृणैर्
यथा। Nī. शत्रुणा दर्शितं पुरःस्थितं
मधु श्रद्दधाना शुष्कतृणैश् छन्ने
प्रपाते यथा पतन्ति तद्वद् एते इत्य् अर्थः
on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities conti-
nued because they were told to successive
generations; when Brahmadatta further
argued that trust had to be placed some-
where to achieve one's objective or else one
would live like a dead person, Pūjanī
replied that if a person continued to run
with injured feet, his feet got more hurt;
she gave the king a long lecture on how one
should guard one's interest by remaining
alert and with constant exertion; one should
leave the place where one was dishonoured;
since Brahmadatta's son had done something
which could not be repaired she had to leave
the place; she also lectured on the king's
duties (offering protection to subjects and
not torturing them by levying heavy taxes);
having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137.
70-108); this conversation (सह भाषीतम्)
between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated
by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109).

Rājadharman used to meet his friend the
Rākṣaka king Virūpākṣa every day 12. 166.
6.
F. Encounter with the Brāhmaṇa
Gautama: Once when Rājadharman
returned from Brahmaloka in the evening he
met Gautama who happened to be at his
residence 12. 163. 17; Rājadharman received
him as his guest with due rites and offered him
a seat of शाल flowers; he also gave him big
fishes from Ganges and fire (for his protec-
tion during the night); he fanned Gautama
with his wings to remove his fatigue and
then asked Gautama his गोत्र; Gautama
told him only his name and that he was a
Brāhmaṇa but nothing else (सो ऽब्रवीद्
गौतमो ऽस्मीति ब्राह्म नान्यद् उदाहरत्
12. 164. 7); Rājadharman offered his guest
a bed of leaves, rich in fragrance and strewn
with fragrant, heavenly flowers; when Rāja-
dharman (Kāśyapa) asked him the reason
of his arrival, Gautama told him that since
he was poor he wanted to go on sea in search
of wealth; Rājadharman (Kāśyapa) told
Gautama that he need have no anxiety for
wealth, since according to Bṛhaspati, there
were four means of acquiring wealth, viz.
inheritance, luck, effort, and friend (चतुर्-
विधा ह्य् अर्थगतिर् बृहस्पतिमतं यथा।
पारंपर्यं तथा दैवं कर्म मित्रम्
इति प्रभो 12. 164. 12); Rājadharman, as
Gautama's friend, would help him to acquire
wealth; in the morning he asked Gautama to
go a distance of three योजनस् along a par-
ticular way where, in the city Meruvraja,
lived Rājadharman's friend Virūpākṣa the
chief of the Rākṣasas (राक्षसाधिपति);
Rājadharman was to Virūpākṣa his brother,
relative and a dear friend; Rājadharman
always trusted Virūpākṣa (स (i. e. Rāja-
dharman) हि माम् आश्रितः सदा) 12. 165. 8;
hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was
prepared to give Gautama all that he desired
12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gau-
tama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with
him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's
residence under the न्यग्रोध tree, the
latter welcomed Gautama and tried to
remove his fatigue by fanning him with
wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27;
Gautama thought of returning home but
since he had nothing to eat on way the
ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rāja-
dharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165.
31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with
flames for the protection of Gautama at
night, and he slept by the side of Gautama
fully trusting him (विश्वस्त); Gautama
killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he
dressed the bird by removing his wings and
hair (स तं विपक्षरोमाणं कृत्वा 12.
166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking
the gold and meat with him Gautama
started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of
days passed without Rājadharman's going to
meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the
Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about
Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that
Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was,
might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore
asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence
and find out whether he was alive; Virū-
pākṣa's son saw near the न्यग्रोध tree only
a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his as-
sociates pursued Gautama, captured him, and
returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rāja-
dharman which was without wings, bones and
feet (°शरीरं च पक्षास्थिचरणोज्झितम्
12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lame-
nted over the loss of his friend and prepared a
funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread
over with perfumes and many pieces of
cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman,
Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral
rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter
of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre
(in the sky); the foam from her mouth,
mixed with milk, fell down on the burning
pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and
met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived
on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman
was alive (दिष्ट्यायं जीवतीत्य् उत 12. 167.
6); Indra told them an old incident (पुरा-
तनम् 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion,
Rājadharman had failed to present himself
in the assembly (सदस्) of Brahmadeva; the
enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die
soon (तस्माद् वधं स दुष्टात्मा नचिरात्
समवाप्स्यति 12. 167. 9 [न चिरात् seems to
contradict पुरातनम्]); hence Rājadharman
was killed by Gautama, but was again
revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12.
167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably dis-
posed to Rājadharman he was requested by
Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life;
Indra revived Gautama and gave him to
Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman em-
braced Gautama who had with him all kinds
of vessels full of gold (सभाण्डोपस्करम्
12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of
Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14;
Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of
Brahmadeva and was received with guest
worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rāja-
dharman and Gautama is called आख्यान
12. 167. 18.

रेणुक
Reṇuka m.: A mythical bird (पक्षिन्).

was on his expedition to fetch अमृत; Garuḍa

लपिता
Lapitā f.: A female Śārṅgikā bird.
The great sage Mandapāla, turned into
a शार्ङ्गक bird, first approached the Śārṅ-
gikā Jaritā, but later transferred his attention
to Lapitā 1. 220. 17; at the time of the
Khāṇḍava fire, when Mandapāla expressed
his anxiety about the safety of his young
ones, Lapitā became jealous and said that
Mandapāla was not really anxious for his
young sons but for Jaritā, his first love;
she knew that his children were powerful,
lustrous, and able speakers; they need have
no fear from fire; moreover Mandapāla had
in her presence secured an assurance from
god Agni that he would not harm Manda-
pāla's children; Lapitā therefore was sure
that Mandapāla was really worried about
Jaritā, her foe; she charged Mandapāla that
he did not love her as he loved Jaritā and
asked him to go to Jaritā and leave her alone
1. 224. 2-13.

लोमश
Lomaśa m.: A cat.
A. Residence: He lived on the branches
of a banyan tree in a certain forest 12. 136. 19,
22; also in a hole (स्वबिलम्) at the foot of
the tree 12. 136. 190.
B. Description: Had
sharp front teeth and eyes resembling the
cat's-eye gem; he was intelligent, eloquent
(वाक्यसंपन्न) and knew the import of
speech वाक्यतत्त्वज्ञ) 12. 136. 65, 64, 94.
C. Palita-Lomaśa Episode: A mouse,
Palita, also lived in a hole at the foot of the
banyan tree; Lomaśa, although normally
watchful (अप्रमत्त 12. 136. 25), was once
caught in a trap (उन्माथ 12. 136. 23) fixed
by a Cāṇḍāla; when this happened Palita
began to move about freely, got a piece of
flesh, and started eating it on the top of the
trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught
in the trap below; just then the mouse
Palita saw his two other enemies, an
ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the
tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately
realized that the cat, his third enemy in
distress, was his only means of escape; he
therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords
of the net if the cat in return promised not
to injure him when he moved near the cat
to protect himself from the ichneumon and
the owl; Palita wished that Lomaśa remained
alive and expected a similar response from
Lomaśa (तव जीवितम् इच्छामि त्वं ममे-
च्छसि जीवितम् 12. 136. 59); the cat too
knew that be by himself was almost at
the end of his life (ताम् अवस्थाम् अवेक्-
ष्यान्त्याम् 12. 136. 64) and hence spoke in
conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomaśa
told the mouse that he had given up his
pride and that he was Palita's devotee and
pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's
order and work in his interest; he requested
Palita to do what would serve the purpose
of both of them; Palita then suggested the
following plan to Lomaśa: the mouse was
to go very close to the cat and while he
was in that condition the cat was to protect
the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon;
when the danger to the mouse from the two
had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of
the net and free the cat; Lomaśa agreed to
this plan and promised not only to be well-
disposed towards Palita when he drew near, but
also offered later to do, with his friends and
relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse
then moved very close to the cat and slept on
his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and
the owl had returned to their respective homes
Palita started to cut off the cords of the net
slowly; Lomaśa tried to hasten him asking
him not to be ungrateful; Lomaśa wanted
Palita to finish the work before the Caṇḍāla
(श्वपच) returned; Palita refused to hasten
until he was sure that the Caṇḍāla was close
by so that Lomaśa, when freed, would not
pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree
from the fear of the Caṇḍāla; Lomaśa again
pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his
work pointing out that good men did not
act the way Palita was going about his
work; Palita should not remember their
past enmity and delay in freeing the cat;
Palita assured Lomaśa that he had cut off
most of the cords and deliberately left only
one which he would bite off at the proper
time; when the night ended and the Caṇḍāla
was seen arriving, Lomaśa was frightened and
asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita
cut off the last cord and the freed Lomaśa
jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita,
and Palita himself entered his hole; when the
disappointed Caṇḍāla went away, Lomaśa
requested Palita not to misunderstand him if
he, when he became free, jumped up the
tree without conversing with Palita (अकृत्वा
संविदं कांचित् सहसाहम् उपप्लुतः।
कृतज्ञं कृतकल्याणं कच्चिन् मां नाभि-
शङ्कसे 12. 136. 119); Lomaśa asked the
mouse to trust him and come close to him as
he wanted to honour Palita who had saved
him; Lomaśa asked Palita to be his minister
and instruct him like a father (अमात्यो मे
भव प्राज्ञ पितेव हि प्रशाधि माम् 12.
136. 126); the counsel (मन्त्र) of the mouse
and the strength (बल) of the cat together
would win victories for them (12. 136. 127);
but Palita pointed out to Lomaśa that he
fell into the trap due to his thoughtlessness
(चपलत्वात् 12. 136. 142); thoughtlessness
does not help the person himself, how can it
help others ?; Palita plainly told the cat that
he wanted the mouse to move close to him
because he was the food of the cat; Palita
refused to go near Lomaśa when that
was the cat's dinner time; Lomaśa made one
more plea to Palita describing himself to be
the knower of duties (धर्मज्ञ), apprecia-
tive of the merits of others (गुणज्ञ), grate-
ful for the good act (कृतज्ञ), and fond of
friends (मित्रेषु वत्सल 12. 136. 179); if the
mouse forsook the cat the latter would die;
Palita, however, remained firm and advised
Lomaśa to protect himself from the Caṇḍāla;
hearing Caṇḍāla's name, the frightened
Lomaśa quickly entered his hole, and Palita
entered his 12. 136. 21-191.

B. Śala-Vāmadeva Episode: Śala the
king of Ayodhyā, once on a hunting expedi-
tion, pursued a deer; his charioteer told him
that it would not be possible for him to
overtake the deer even if the two Vāmya
horses were yoked to his chariot; when asked
by the king about those horses, the charioteer
told him that the two horses ran with the speed
of mind (मनोजवौ); the king approached
Vāmadeva and requested him to give the two
horses to pursue the deer; Vāmadeva agreed
on condition that the horses be returned
without delay when the king's purpose was
served; the king yoked the horses to his
chariot, caught the deer, but did not return
the horses to Vāmadeva thinking that such
‘jewels among horses’ should not be in the
possession of the Brāhmaṇas (अश्वरत्नाव्
इमाव् अयोग्यौ ब्राह्मणानाम् 3. 190. 52);
Vāmadeva, after waiting for a month, sent
his pupil to ask the king to return the
Vāmyas; the king refused to part with them
saying that the Brāhmaṇas did not need horses
(किं च ब्राह्मणानाम् अश्वैह् कार्यम् 3.
190. 57); Vāmadeva himself approached the
king and asked him to return the horses or
else he would be struck by Varuṇa with his
nooses; the king told Vāmadeva that draught
oxen were suitable for Brāhmaṇas and
that the two Vāmyas belonged to him as a
Kṣatriya; the king refused to hand over the
Vāmyas even when the Rākṣasas, the evil
spirits (यातुआहान) created by Vāma-
deva's curse, struck the king with their
spikes and brought him down; Dala, the
brother of Śala, who was next appointed king
returned the Vāmya horses to Vāmadeva

3. 147. 27) by Vālin; Rāma advised to take
Sugrīva's help for the recovery of Sītā
3. 263. 39; Rāma and Sugrīva entered
into an agreement: Rāma promised to
kill Vālin and Sugrīva in return promised
help in winning back Sītā 3. 264. 14-15;
when Sugrīva challenged Vālin he was not
able to stand the roars of Sugrīva; Tārā,
his wife, tried to dissuade him from going out
to punish Sugrīva; Vālin asked her to find out
and tell him whose help Sugrīva had secured;
she told him about the friendship between
Rāma and Sugrīva based on having enemies
for similar reasons (both deprived of their
wives) (तुल्यारिमित्रतां प्राप्तः सुग्रीवेण
धनुर्धरः (रामः) 3. 264. 21); Vālin
disregarded Tārā's advice; he suspected her of
secretly loving Sugrīva, scolded her, and went
out of his cave (गुहामुख 3. 264. 26); he
reminded Sugrīva that he was defeated on
several occasions before but was spared be-
cause he was Vālin's kinsman (मुक्तो ज्ञातिर्
इति ज्ञात्वा 3. 264. 27); the two brothers
fought a duel with शाल and palm trees, and
rocks; they also used their fists, nails and
teeth; it was not possible to distinguish between
the two, hence Hanūmant stuck a garland on
Sugrīva's neck; Rāma was then able to single
out Vāli (3. 264. 35) for his target and
shoot an arrow on his chest; with his vitals
pierced and vomitting blood Vālin saw Rāma
at a distance; he blamed Rāma (for shoot-
ing him that way) and fell unconscious on the
ground; after Vālin's death Sugrīva received
the kingdom of Kiṣkindhā and also Tārā 3.

appeared 1. 33. 8; conscious of his merits and
faults (गुणदोषौ मदाश्रयौ 1. 33. 31).

nectar: Vāsuki was used as the churning cord
(नेत्र 1. 16. 12; 1. 35. 4) by the gods and
the demons at the time of समुद्रमन्थन;
his one end was held by the great असुरस्,
the tail by all the gods; the serpent Ananta
stood near Nārāyaṇa and raised up and
threw down again and again the head of
Vāsuki; from the mouth of Vāsuki, whose
body was forcibly dragged at the time of
churning, smoky winds with fire came out
repeatedly which turned into clouds and lightn-
ings and showered rain on the gods fatigued
due to the labour of churning the ocean 1. 16.
13-16.
G. Vāsuki and the snake sacrifice
of Janamejaya: When Vāsuki heard the curse
of Kadrū, the mother of serpents, that they
would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya (1. 13. 35), he held consultations
with his brother Airāvata and other serpents
to think of the remedy to nullify the curse
(शापो ऽयं न भवेत् कथम् 1. 33. 1); he
told them that all curses had a cure, but the
curse of a mother would be difficult to avert,
especially when the curse was uttered within
the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e.
Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not
stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet
they had to find a way out before it was too
late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya did not get started or, if started,
it could be defeated in its purpose (यथा स
यज्ञो न भवेद् यथा वापि पराभवेत् 1.
33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the sugges-
tions made by serpents to avoid the snake
sacrifice but did not agree with any one of
them; he himself had nothing better to offer,
hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time
Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha
Brahman had prophesied that the son of the
great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having
the same name would stop the snake sacrifice
and free virtuous serpents from danger,
Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister,
who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when
he came begging for a maiden; that would
put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34.
1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean,
the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha
Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very
much disturbed due to the curse of his mother
and that Pitāmaha should free him from his
mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki
had always acted for the benefit of the gods
and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha
had then told the gods that when the occasion
arrived Vāsuki should act according to the
advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25;
1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great
care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be
the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appoi-
nted various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru
and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived
asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jarat-
kāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him
about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl
of his name and who was offered as alms;
knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage
Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the
sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also
told him that even after marriage it would be
Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42.
16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his
sister had the same name as the sage and
that he would support her even after marriage
with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2;
1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's
residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru
went with his wife to the shining house
(वासगृहं शुभ्रम् 1. 43. 5) approved by
Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru
left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki
about his departure and that he had lived
happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife
pleaded with the sage that he should not
abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki
would feel if he knew that her husband had
left her without blessing her with a son—
that being the principal purpose of their
marriage—1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew
about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry;
but he would not pursue the sage fearing that
he might curse him; he knew it was improper
to ask his sister if she was with a child from
Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter
prompted him to do that (किं हि कार्य-
गरीयस्त्वात् ततस् त्वाहम् अचूचुदम् 1. 44.
6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had
conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous
son will be born to her; she removed his
anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was
happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1.
44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began
Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death
of a large number of serpents and feared that
he himself might fall into the fire; he there-
fore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time
had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and
stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 19-
26; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to ful-
fil the purpose for which she was married to
Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka
why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1.
49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was
terribly upset, that he would release him from
the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21;
when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by
saying that he felt he was revolving, that
his heart was bursting, and that he had lost
sense of directions as he was afflicted by
the punishment inflicted by Brahman (आस्तीक
परिघूर्णामि हृदयं मे विदीर्यते।दिशश्
च न प्रजानामि ब्रह्मदण्डनिपीडितः 1.
49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would
destroy Vāsuki's fear of ब्रह्मदण्ड 1. 49.
22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult
task Āstīka returned to his mother and
maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to
them all that had happened at Janamejaya's
snake sacrifice; all the serpents present
were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18.

विकुण्ड
Vikuṇḍa m.: A mythical serpent, living
in Bhogavatī Purī 5. 101. 16, 1.
Son of Surasā and Kaśyapa 5. 101. 4, 17;
description 5. 101. 5-7.

विनता
Vinatā f.: A mythical female being.
A. Family: One of the two daughters
of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1),
both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one
of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59.
12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24.
B. Description: Divine (देवी) 1. 14. 15;
beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5;
shining (शुभा, also 1. 14. 5), auspicious
(कल्याणी) and famous (यशस्विनी) 1. 27. 24.
C. Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband,
granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose
to have two sons, stronger than the sons of
Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a
half sons as desired (? अध्यर्धं पुत्रम्
ईप्सितम् 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that
one of her two sons was not fully developed ?
1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said
“so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know
that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 6-
10; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs
which were preserved for five hundred years
in warm pots by the female attendants
(सोपस्वेदेषु भाण्डेषु 1. 14. 13; Nī. सोपस्-
वेदेषु उष्मवत्सु on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.);
when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons
came out of the eggs but nothing came out of
the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and
desirous of quickly having a son, broke one
of the two eggs and saw her partly developed
son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also
1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the
slave (दासी 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she
vied; he also told the mother that her second
son will free her from slavery if she did not
break the other egg prematurely and produce
a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son
became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was
born at proper time; as soon as born he left
Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1.
26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son,
practised penance and observed vows; having
bathed and become pure she approached her
husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male
child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would
succeed and that she would give birth to heroic
sons; he also told her to carefully bear the
गर्भ; Vinatā delighted when thus addressed
by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and
Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa
and Garuḍa called वैनतेयौ ‘sons of
Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two
sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas
and the conception of Kaśyapa (तपसा वाल-
खिल्यानां मम संकल्पजौ तथा।भ-
विष्यतो महाभागौ पुत्रौ ते लोकपूजितौ)
1. 27. 27; 1. 27. 1-2; besides Aruṇa and
Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi
also called वैनतेयाः 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62
(with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place
of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending
from her (विनताकुल), of noble family,
propagated by Garuḍa through his six sons
5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya1].
D. Slave
of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and
Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥ-
śravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū
later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse;
Vinatā declared it to be white and asked
Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a
wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse
had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to
lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then
went home agreeing to inspect the horse the
next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two
sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from
near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1.
19. 1-3; when they found that there were
many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas,
Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who
lost the bet and was defeated was grieved
to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1.
20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited
the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the
ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence
of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful
Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the नागस् in the
middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as command-
ed and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother,
carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked
Vinatā why he must act as told by the ser-
pents; Vinatā informed him that she having
lost the wager had become the slave of her
sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa
how he (and his mother) could be free from
slavery, told him to get अमृत for them
to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12;
Garuḍa got ready to fetch अमृत and
asked Vinatā what he might eat on way;
Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose
abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean
(समुद्रकुक्षाव् एकान्ते 1. 24. 2), and warned
him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3;
on being further asked by Garuḍa how he
could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him:
“who, when swallowed, burns your throat like
a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāh-
maṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the
incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him
as follows: “May Wind protect your wings,
Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun
the whole of you; myself shall always endeav-
our for your comfort and well-being (शान्ति-
स्वस्तिपरायणा 1. 24. 9); may your path
be free from obstacles and may you succeed
in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa
met his father and told him that he was on his
way to fetch सोम in order to free his mother
from slavery; he also told him that he was
asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was
not satisfied even after eating thousands of
them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might
eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in
getting सोम (अमृत) he approached his
mother and told the serpents that since he
was leaving the अमृत for them on कुश grass
his mother should be freed from slavery from
that day; the serpents said: “so be it”;
Garuḍa then roamed in the forest with his
mother Vinatā and gave delight to her 1. 30.
14-17, 21.
E. Functions: Vinatā is one
of those (like Surasā, Surabhi and many
others) who wait upon Pitāmaha in his सभा
2. 11. 29, 31.
F. Svāhā identified with
Vinatā ?: Svāhā, the daughter of Dakṣa
(3. 213. 50) while getting away with the seed
of Agni assumed the form of a female Garuḍa
(गरुडी), a female Suparṇa (सुपर्णी) to
escape identification 3. 214. 7-10); 3. 215. 3;
Svāhā as Vinatā (as Suparṇī 3. 215. 4) told
Skanda that he was her son qualified to give
her the श्राद्ध oblation (मम त्वं पिण्ड-
दः सुतः) 3. 219. 12; as one of the mothers
of Skanka, Vinatā, highly ferocious, assumes
the form of a शिकुनिग्रह (bird-affliction ?)
to torment young children until they are
sixteen years old 3. 219. 26, 22, 41.

sacrifice of Janamejaya; described as ‘fast as

शकुल
Śakula m.: A kind of fish.
Three of them, friends of one another,
lived together in a shallow pond which
abounded in fish; one of them was characteri-
zed as Prāptakālajña ‘who knows the proper
time (for action), who has the presence of
mind’ (also called Saṃpratipattijña, Prati-
pattimant, or Saṃpratipattimant 12. 135. 9,
13, 15), the other as Dīrghadarśin ‘who has
forethought’, and the third as Dīrghasūtra
‘who procrastinates’; seeing, once, the water
level falling down, Dīrghadarśin apprehended
danger and told his friends that they had
better quickly move out before their way to
get out was cut off; Dīrghasūtra agreed with
him but saw no reason to make haste;
Saṃpratipattijña, however, said that he
would not fail to take the correct course when
time arrived; then Dīrghadarśin, of great
intelligence, went out alone to a deep lake
following a water current; when the water in
the lake had thoroughly flown out the fisher-
men began to catch the fish by various
means; Dīrghasūtra got caught with others;
when the fish that were caught were being tied
to strings, Pratipattimant got himself mixed
with those that were tied already and he held
the string tight with his mouth (and thus
escaped being actually tied by the string);
when the fish, thus tied, were being washed
in dirt-free water, Saṃprattimant gave up
the string and escaped; the dull-witted and
of low intelligence Dīrghasūtra, however,
invited death on himself; thus one who does
not recognize the most opportune time is
destroyed like Dīrghasūtra; one like Saṃpra-
tipattimant, who does not provide for his
welfare in advance thinking himself to be
clever, meets with danger; who, like Dīrgha-
darśin, adopts proper course before the danger
sets in, attains great bliss; this excellent
आख्यान (आख्यानम् अनुत्तमम् 12. 135. 1)

should be done and what not was related by

sometimes identified with Ananta; living in

by Sūta as the first son of Kadrū, the second
being Vāsuki (शेषः प्रथमतो जातो
वासुकिस् तदनन्तरम् 1. 31. 5; hence called
भुजगवराग्रज ‘elder brother of the
excellent serpent’ (i. e. of Vāsuki) 1. 32.
22; listed as a काद्रवेय (son of Kadrū,
daughter of Dakṣa) along with Ananta,
Vāsuki and others 1. 59. 40; Bhīṣma told
Duryodhana that Vāsudeva Janārdana created
the divine Śeṣa who is known as Ananta 6.
63. 10.
B. Epithets and Description: ad-
orable (भगवन्त्) 1. 32. 2; lord (प्रभु)
1. 32. 5, (प्रभुर् भुवः) 1. 32. 22;

48; described as ‘high as white mountain, wear-
ing various ornaments, his tongues being like
flames of fire, and of great strength’ (श्वेतो-
च्चयनिभाकारो नानाविधविभूषणः। …
ज्वालाजिह्वो महाबलः) 5. 101. 3; the big
white snake issuing from the mouth of Bala-
rāma is described as ‘having a thousand heads,
having an expanse like that of a mountain, and
having a red face’ (सहस्रशीर्षः पर्वता-
भोगवर्ष्मा।रक्ताननः) where appare-
ntly Śeṣa is meant, but is not directly named
16. 5. 12-13.
C. Śeṣa's austerities and
meeting with Brahmadeva: Śesa deserted
his mother Kadrū and visited the slopes of
the Himālayas; there on the Gandhamādana
mountain and in Badarī, as also at other holy
places like Gokarṇa, Puṣkarāraṇya and in
various तीर्थस् and holy abodes (आयतनेषु
1. 32. 4) Śeṣa practised severe austerities
living on wind and observing difficult vows;
he lived all alone and had controlled his
senses (एकान्तशीली, विजितेन्द्रियः 1. 32. 4);
during the austerities he put on bark garments
and wore matted hair; his flesh, skin and
sinews dried up; when Pitāmaha Brahman,
saw Śeṣa in this condition he asked him to
do something beneficial to the people instead
of tormenting them by his severe austerities;
he asked Śeṣa the reason for undertaking the
austerities; Śeṣa told Pitāmaha that his
serpent brothers were dull-witted; they envied
each other and did not suffer either Vinatā
or her son (Vainateya Garuḍa) who was
their cousin; they hated Garuḍa; Śeṣa there-
fore did not want to see his brothers nor live
with them; Śeṣa undertook austerities to give
up his body and to avoid the company of his
brothers in the next life; he asked Pitāmaha's
permission to do that 1. 32. 5-12; Brahman
told Śeṣa that his brothers faced danger
because they had offended their mother but
that incident had been taken care of; since
Śeṣa was devoted to righteousness (दिष्ट्या
च बुद्धिर् धर्मे ते 1. 32. 16), Pitāmaha
offered him a boon 1. 32. 13-16; Śeṣa
desired to find pleasure in righteousness
(धर्म), equanimity (शम), and austerity
(तपस्) 1. 32. 17.
D. Śeṣa as supporter
of the earth: Brahman was pleased with Śeṣa's
self-control and equanimity and asked him
to collect the earth properly and hold it so
that it became steady for the benefit of the
creatures; Śeṣa agreed to do what Brahman
desired and asked Brahman to place the
earth on his head; Brahman asked him to go
below the earth for which earth would
provide an opening (विवर) 1. 32. 21-22;
Śeṣa entered the earth through a cleft and
held the divine (देवी) earth, girdled by the
oceans, after enclosing it on all sides; he made
the earth firm 1. 32. 19-22; 5. 101. 2; 6. 63.
10; 7. 69. 48; for this feat of holding the
earth Śeṣa compared with Brahman or with
Balabhid (Indra) 1. 32. 23; (here called
नाग Ananta) dwells all alone below the
earth 1. 32. 24; Brahman gave to Śeṣa Vaina-
teya Suparṇa (i. e. Garuḍa) as his friend
1. 32. 25.
E. Association with Viṣṇu
Nārāyaṇa: Nārāyaṇa told Mārkaṇḍeya that
he, having become Śeṣa, supports the earth
surrounded by the four oceans and adorned
by Meru and Mandara 3. 187. 10; when the
entire creation, both moving and non-moving,
gets lost in one single ocean, god Viṣṇu Nārā-
yaṇa sleeps alone on the bed of water on the
huge body of Śeṣa; at that time with Śeṣa's
great coil Viṣṇu encompasses the whole earth
and sustains it 3. 194. 8-10; Hari Nārāyaṇa
when he is in his निद्रायोग also sleeps on
the bed in the form of the body of the snake
(Śeṣa not named here) which is arranged
on water 12. 335. 57-58, 17.
F. Śeṣa's
place in the four व्यूहस् of the Pāñcarātra
system: Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that his
fourth form (मूर्ति) created imperishable
(अव्यय) Śeṣa who is known as Saṃka-
rṣaṇa; from him was created Pradyumna
12. 326. 68; जीव is called Śeṣa Saṃkarṣaṇa
12. 326. 35.
G. Other features of his
eminence: (1) A जीव, before attaining
सिद्धि (12. 271. 44) passes through various
courses before he reaches the undecaying and
infinite place of Viṣṇu, Brahman, Śeṣa, and
Nara 12. 271. 50; (2) Droṇa while blessing
Duryodhana says: “May Śeṣa, the eminent
among the serpents, grant well being (स्वस्ति)
to you” 7. 69. 48; (3) Baladeva was the
incarnation of a portion of Śeṣa 1. 61. 91;
(4) He with other snakes came to greet
Arjuna's birth 1. 114. 60.

they refused for the fear of a mouse; the

Sārisṛkva said: “You are resolute and
intelligent, we are in danger to our life;
there is no doubt that only one among
many is really heroic and wise” (1. 223.

praised god Fire; when his turn came Sāri-
sṛkva drew the attention of god Fire to their
condition (deserted by parents; their wings
not grown) and appealed to him to save
them since they had no other saviour; Agni
should protect them that were seeking shelter
with his benevolent form and his seven
flames (सप्त हेतयः 1. 223. 10); Jāta-

the young ‘seers’ (ऋषीन् अस्मान् बालकान्

सुग्रीवाः where सुग्रीवाः apparently means
‘those having good necks’. But Nī. who
reads उद्धता ईव सुग्रीवाः takes सुग्रीवाः
to stand for all the horses of Kṛṣṇa,
Sugrīva and the others (वासुदेवाश्वा इव
उद्धताः, on Bom. Edn. 12. 101. 17]

was son of Indra) 3. 12. 47; 3. 147. 27;
3. 154. 49; 3. 263. 41; due to enmity
between the two, Vālin considered Sugrīva

षभ 3. 266. 29.
D. Residence: Insu-
lted (? deceived ? निकृतः) by Valin for
some reason, he lived with his four counse-
llors (सचिव 3. 263. 41; 3. 264. 10, 23;
3. 266. 65) on the mountain Ṛśyamūka,
near Pampā; Hanūmant specially became
friendly with Sugrīva 3. 147. 26-27;
3. 263. 40-41; 3. 264. 6, 9, 23.
E.
Meeting with Rāma: Gandharva Viśvāvasu
advised Rāma to approach Sugrīva for help
in his search for Sītā and gave him
Sugrīva's address who lived with his four
counsellors on the mountain Ṛśyamūka, near
Pampā; according to Viśvāvasu Sugrīva
knew Rāvaṇa's whereabouts 3. 263. 39-42;
Lakṣmaṇa while comforting Rāma who was
grieving over Sītā's loss suggested to meet
Sugrīva; they saw Sugrīva and four other
monkeys (वानरान् पञ्च 3. 264. 9) on the
Ṛśyamūka mountain (also 3. 147. 31);
Sugrīva sent Hanūmant to them; having
talked with him, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
approached Sugrīva and became friends (also
3. 147. 32; 3. 264. 57, 60; 3. 266 62);
the monkeys showed to Rāma Sītā's upper
garment (वासः 3. 264. 12) which inspired
confidence in him; Rāma consecrated Sugrīva
as the chief of the monkeys (सुग्रीवं प्लव-
गाधिपम्।पृथिव्यां वानरैश्वर्ये स्वयं
रामो ऽभ्यषेचयत् 3. 264. 13; 3. 266. 6);
Rāma promised to kill Vālin in battle and
Sugrīva promised help in getting back Sītā
(also 3. 258. 3); Sugrīva then went to
Kiṣkindhā and roared near Vālin's residence
to challenge him for a fight; when asked by
Vālin whose help Sugrīva had secured his
wife Tārā told him that Rāma had become
friend of Sugrīva since both had comparable
enemies (तुल्यारिमित्रतां प्राप्तः 3. 264.
21); when told further by Tārā that Sugrīva
and others were quite capable of destroying
Vālin, he suspected that Tārā loved Sugrīva;
Vālin went out of his residence and reminded
Sugrīva that formerly on many occasions he
had defeated Sugrīva but not killed him since
Sugrīva was his kinsman (मुक्तो ज्ञातिर् इति
ज्ञात्वा 3. 264. 27); Sugrīva, while alerting
Rāma, retorted that although Vālin had
deprived Sugrīva of his kingdom and his wife
he wanted to show him how much of his life-
force still remained with him (हृतदारस्य
मे राजन् हृतराज्यस्य च त्वया।किं नु
जीवितसामर्थ्यम् इति विद्धि समागतम् 3.
264. 29); the two brothers were then engaged
in a duel; during the fight, the one could not be
distinguished from the other; hence Hanūmant
put a garland around the neck of Sugrīva;
Sugrīva with garland around his neck com-
pared with the great mountain Malaya circled
by a garland of clouds (3. 264. 34); Rāma
then could correctly aim arrow at Vālin; when
Vālin died Sugrīva got Kiṣkindhā and Tārā
(also 3. 147. 32); when Rāma lived on the
mountain Mālyavant, Sugrīva waited on him
(3. 264. 1-40; 3. 266. 1); Rāma suspected
Sugrīva to have become ungrateful (कृतघ्न
3. 266. 8) and hence not active in making
efforts to find Sītā (अनुद्युक्त 3. 266. 10);
he abused him as the very low in his family
(कुलाधम), foolish (मूढ) and an
outcaste among the monkeys (वानरापसद)
3. 266. 6, 8; Rāma wanted Lakṣmaṇa to
remind Sugrīva that he had killed Vālin for
Sugrīva's sake and if he did not want to fulfil
the agreement (न जानीते समयप्रतिपाद-
नम् 3. 266. 9), Rāma would send him also
along the path of Vālin; if, on the other hand,
Sugrīva wanted to exert himself for Rāma's
cause, he should present himself before Rāma;
Lakṣmaṇa was received by Sugrīva and his
wife with all humility; with folded hands
Sugrīva informed Lakṣmaṇa that he was
neither ungrateful nor dull-witted; he had not
remained idle and had sent monkeys in all
directions in search of Sītā (also 3. 147. 32-
33); they have been asked to report back
within a month, and Rāma would get the
good news within five days; Lakṣmaṇa was
happy to learn this and he honoured Sugrīva;
the two then met Rāma on the Mālyavant;
the monkeys informed Sugrīva that Hanū-
mant, Aṅgada and other monkey-chiefs
who were sent to the south had returned
and were enjoying the Madhuvana; from
their behaviour Sugrīva inferred that they
must have been successful in their mission
and informed Rāma accordingly; Hanūmant
and others met Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and
Sugrīva and bowed to them 3. 266. 5-32;
being friend of Rāma Sugrīva had enquired
through Hanūmant about the welfare of Sītā;
Sītā had heard of Sugrīva from the Rākṣasa
Avindhya 3. 266. 62, 65.
F. Part in
the war with Rāvaṇa: At the instance of
Sugrīva many monkey-chiefs came with their
troops to help Rāma in war; they encamped
near Kiṣkindhā with the consent of Sugrīva;
on an auspicious day, under a favourable
constellation, and at an approved hour (तिथौ
प्रशस्ते नक्षत्रे मुहूर्ते चाभिपूजीते
3. 267. 14), Rāma and Sugrīva marched
towards the south; when they reached the
ocean Rāma held consultations with Sugrīva
about the means to cross the ocean 3. 267. 1,
13-15, 23-24; when Vibhīṣaṇa came to
Rāma, Sugrīva suspected him of being a
spy 3. 267. 47; during the war Sugrīva
fought a duel with Virūpākṣa 3. 269. 8; when
Kumbhakarṇa struck terror in the hearts of
Tāra and the other monkey-chiefs, Sugrīva
attacked Kumbhakarṇa and struck him on
his head with a Śāla tree; but this had no
effect on the demon; Kumbhakarṇa over-
powered Sugrīva and tried to forcibly take
him away; seeing that, Lakṣmaṇa attacked
Kumbhakarṇa 3. 271. 6-10; after Kumbha-
karṇa's death Rāvaṇa sent Indrajit to kill
Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva 3. 272. 2, 5;
Sugrīva with other monkey-chiefs surrounded
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell on the
ground struck by the arrows of Indrajit;
Sugrīva rid them of arrows with the powerful
विशल्या herb and by using a divine spell (विशल्-
यया महौषध्या दिव्यमन्त्रप्रयुक्तया
3. 273. 6); Sugrīva with others, applied
water sent by Kubera to the eyes so that
they could see invisible beings 3. 273. 3, 6, 7.
G. After the war: Rāma crossed the ocean
back to Kiṣkindhā with Sugrīva and his
other ministers (यथामुख्यैर् अमात्यैः
3. 275. 52) in the Puṣpaka विमान; they
all then went to Ayodhyā; when Rāma was
consecrated on the throne he consented to the
departure of Sugrīva and others to their homes
3. 275. 50-59, 66.
H. Comparisons: Fight
between Bhīma and Kirmīra, between Bhīma
and Jaṭāsura, and between Ghaṭotkaca and
Alāyudha compared to the one between
Vālin and Sugrīva 3. 12. 47; 3. 154. 49;
7. 153. 27.

सुप्रतीक
Supratīka1 m.: Name of Bhagadatta's
elephant.
A. Description: big (महाद्विप 6.
91. 41; 7. 25. 36; 7. 27. 29; 7. 28. 39); excel-
lent, chief or king of the elephants (गज-
प्रवर 6. 91. 52; नागप्रवर 7. 25. 20, 58;
वारणोत्तम 6. 17. 36; द्विपर्षभ 7. 25. 35;
द्विरदश्रेष्ठ 7. 26. 5; नागेन्द्र 6. 91. 36;
गजपति 6. 91. 43; नागराज 6. 79. 25; 7.
25. 56); very swift (आशुगति 7. 25. 39),
hence although one, appeared to enemies like
hundreds or hosts of elephants 7. 25. 39, 59;
never fatigued, the elephant always achieved
his objective in battles (संख्ये कृतकर्मा
जितक्लमः) 7. 26. 5; indescribable, unrival-
led in battles (सदाप्रतिगजो युधि।सर्व-
शब्दातिगः) 7. 26. 5; white like silver
(रजतोपम 6. 112. 57); compared with
elephant of Indra (महेन्द्रगजसंनिभ
6. 112. 55); at one place Supratīka actually
identified with the elephant of Indra (येन
नागेन मघवान् अजयद् दैत्यदानवान्।स
नागप्रवरो भीमं सहसा समुपाद्रवत्)
7. 25. 20; yet also said to be in appearance
(dark ?) like a cloud (जीमूतसंकाशान्
नागात् 7. 27. 24).
B. Part in the epic
war: Ordered by Bhīsma, Bhagadatta with
his elephant in rut (not named) rushed against
Bhīma; Abhimanyu and other heroes pierced
the elephant with arrows; incited, the elephant
ran with double speed; the rutting elephant,
goaded by Bhagadatta, attacked with double
speed the Pāṇḍava warriors like the God of
Death; seeing his big form all the great
warriors on the side of the Pāṇḍavas became
uneasy 6. 60. 37-44; Ghaṭotkaca drove his
elephant against Bhagadatta in order to kill
him and his elephant; the other elephants
driven by the Rākṣasas also attacked Bhaga-
datta's elephant with tusks; afflicted by the
attack and pierced with arrows, Bhagadatta's
elephant roared loudly like a thunder; hearing
it Bhīṣma reported to Droṇa and Duryodhaṇa
that Bhagadatta must be in danger 6. 60. 53-
57; in another battle between Bhagadatta and
Ghaṭotkaca, the latter tried to kill the former's
elephant (Supratīka not named, referred to as
प्राग्ज्योतिषगज) with a शक्ति, but it was cut
into three pieces by Bhagadatta 6. 79. 37-38;
Bhagadatta, mounted on Supratīka, attacked
the Pāṇḍava heroes (6. 91. 23); Bhagadatta,
seated on Supratīka's head (सुप्रतीकशिरो-
गतः 6. 91. 33), ichor flowing from Supra-
tīka's temples in seven streams, attacked
Bhīma 6. 91. 31-33, 37; Pāṇḍava warriors
encircled Supratīka on all sides; Supratīka
attacked by the mountain-like elephant of the
king of the Daśārṇa country 6. 91. 40, 42;
Bhagadatta goaded his elephant Supratīka
with his hook and toe (अङ्कुशाङ्गुष्ठनुदितः
स गजप्रवरो युधि 6. 91. 52); running
hither and thither Supratīka crushed chariots,
horses together with their riders, and foot-
soldiers in hundreds and thousands; as a
result the Pāṇḍava army squeezed like a piece
of skin placed on fire; in order to kill Supra-
tīka Ghaṭotkaca hurled his शूल against
him, but Bhagadatta protected him by
cutting down the शूल 6. 91. 53-54, 57-58;
Bhagadatta, with his Supratīka crushing
the Pāṇḍava army, rushed towards Yudhi-
ṣṭhira 6. 91. 79; Arjuna with great effort
checked the advance of Supratīka and pierced
him with sharp arrows made of अयस् 6.
112. 55, 57; in the fight of Bhagadatta with
Bhīma, the former's elephant (Supratīka
not named) appeared to kill Bhīma 7. 25.
19-24; Bhagadatta on his elephant fought the
army of the Pāṇḍavas and the Pāñcālas 7.
25. 24-27, and the army led by Yudhiṣṭhira
7. 25. 32-41; Bhagadatta's elephant took
hold of Sātyaki's chariot and hurled it away
7. 25. 36; in the encounter between Bhaga-
datta's elephant and the elephant of the king
of Daśārṇas the former proved victorious 7. 25.
28-30; in the encounter between Bhīma and
Bhagadatta, the latter's elephant frightened
Bhīma's horses by sprinkling water on them
7. 25. 43; he shattered the charioteer of
Yuyutsu by stepping on his horses 7. 25.
49; Bhagadatta charged his elephant against
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuṇa to kill them; seeing him
rush like the angry God of Death, Kṛṣṇa
avoided frontal attack by quickly driving
Arjuna's chariot around the elephant keeping
him on the right (चक्रे ऽपसव्यं त्वरितः
स्यन्दनेन जनार्दनः 7. 27. 28); although
Supratīka was within his reach, Arjuna, rem-
embering the rule (of the war), did not kill
the elephant together with Bhagadatta from
behind (संप्राप्तम् अपि नेयेष परावृत्तं
महाद्विपम्।सारोहं मृत्युसात्कर्तुं
स्मरन् धर्मं धनंजयः 7. 27. 29);
Bhagadatta's elephant then sent many
elephants and horses to death and crushed
the chariots 7. 27. 27-30.
C. Supratīka
not named: As in some of the above
accounts, at some other places also Bhaga-
datta is mentioned with his elephant without
naming the elephant; at all such places
obviously Supratīka is meant: 5. 164. 38;
6. 17. 36; 6. 60. 53, 59; 6. 79. 37, 41;
6. 91. 37; 6. 112. 54-57; 7. 25. 19; 7. 26.
3, 5; 7. 27. 21-24; 27-30; 7. 28. 3, 8.
D. Comparisons: (1) with mountain: (a)
Supratīka with ichor issuing out at seven
places compared with a mountain with water
flowing down on all sides 6. 91. 32; (b)
pierced by arrows and blood issuing from his
body, Supratīka looked like Himavant
coloured with red minerals (धातुचित्र
इवाद्रिराट्) 6. 91. 41; (c) fight between
Supratīka and the elephant of the king
of Daśārṇas compared with that of two
winged mountains 7. 25. 29; (d) Bhaga-
datta's elephant frightened the enemies as
formerly the chief winged mountain frightened
(its enemies ?) 7. 25. 56; (e) Bhagadatta's
elephant devoid of his armour looked like the
king of the mountains bereft of clouds 7. 28. 8;
(2) with other elephants: (a) Supratīka
with Bhagadatta seated on him and shooting
arrows compared with Airāvata with Indra
seated on him and sending down streams of
water 6. 91 33, (5. 16. 38); (b) Bhaga-
datta on elephant destroying Pāṇḍava army
compared with Indra on his Airāvata destroy-
ing the Dānavas 7. 25. 40; (c) Bhagadatta's
elephant crushed the Pāṇḍava army as a
wild elephant crushes a host of lotuses 6. 79.
41; (3) with cloud: Bhagadatta's elephant
pierced by arrows looked like a big cloud
penetrated by sun's rays 7. 25. 52; (4) with
ocean: Bhagadatta's elephant frightened the
enemies as ocean frightens the merchants 7. 25.
56; (5) with shore of the ocean: Supratīka
checked the onslaught of the elephant of the
Daśārṇa king as the shore checks the advance
of the ocean 6. 91. 43; (6) with arrow:
Supratīka, discharged against Bhīma, sped
like an arrow discharged from the bow-string
6. 91. 37; (7) with fire: Supratīka goaded
by Bhagadatta looked like the Saṃvartaka
fire 6. 91. 52.
E. End: Bhagadatta, with
his elephant Supratīka, was killed (शस्त)
by Arjuna 1. 2. 161; in the final encounter of
Bhagadatta with Arjuna, the latter cut down
the armour of Bhagadatta's elephant (Su-
pratīka not named) 7. 28. 8; he struck the
elephant between the temples with the नाराच
arrow; the arrow went deep upto its feathered
part; with the limbs stiffened and the tusks
piercing the ground, the elephant fell down;
he died roaring aloud 7. 28. 37, 39.

it is difficult to measure the dimensions of
Supratīka whose body stands immeasurably
spread downwards, above and cross-wise; all
these elephants, Supratīka and the four
दिग्गजस्, seize with their trunks the winds
blowing from all directions and release them
quickly and slowly which then blow into
this world to sustain the creatures 6. 13.
34-37; the four दिग्गजस्, Airāvata and the
others born in the कुल of Supratīka, live in
Pātāla 5. 97. 15, 1; lordly elephants born in

सुमुख
Sumukha1 m.: A mythical serpent,
living in Bhogavatī Purī 5. 101. 23, 1.
A. Birth: Born in the कुल of Airā-
vata, grandson of Āryaka, son of Cikura;
his mother was the daughter of Vāmana 5.
101. 23, 24; his father was killed by Vaina-
teya (Garuḍa) 5. 101. 24.
B. Eminence:
A big snake (महानाग 5. 103. 5); excellent
snake, king or chief of snakes (भुजगोत्तम
5. 101. 25; नागराज् 5. 101. 23; नागपति 5.
101. 26).
C. Description: Lustrous, pleas-
ing to look at 5. 101. 19; high banner of

qualities as attentiveness, fortitude, handsome-
ness and young age (प्रणिधानेन धैर्येण

as good character, purity and self-control
(सुमुखस्य गुणैश् चैव शीलशौचदमा-
दिभिः) 5. 102. 10.
D. Marriage with
Guṇakeśī: Mātali while searching in the
Nāgaloka a bride-groom for his daughter
Guṇakesī happened to notice the serpent
Sumukha in Bhogavatī Purī; he was happy to
see him 5. 101. 22; when told by Nārada who
Sumukha was, Mātali chose him as his son-in-
law; he told Nārada accordingly and requested
Nārada to make effort to obtain Sumukha 5.
101. 21, 25, 26; Nārada approached Āryaka,
Sumukha's grand-father, and told him what
Mātali had in mind; Āryaka was told that
although Sumukha had no father he was
chosen by Mātali on account of his good quali-
ties 5. 101. 6, 10; Āryaka was happy to hear
the proposal but he was distressed because
Garuḍa had announced his intention to eat up
Sumukha after a month 5. 102. 15; 5. 103. 5;
the threat was bound to come true as Garuḍa
wanted to feed his large progeny by killing
Sumukha 5. 102. 16; 5. 103. 5; Mātali then
proposed to take Sumukha with him to meet
Indra and make effort to prolong the remaining
life-span of Sumukha and thwart Garuḍa in
carrying out his threat 5. 102. 17-21; Viṣṇu,
who happened to be present when all met
Indra, asked Indra to give अमृत to Sumukha
and make him (immortal) like other gods;
Viṣṇu desired Sumukha and the rest to get
what they wanted; Indra, however, asked
Viṣṇu himself to give अमृत to Sumukha;
when asked by Viṣṇu again, Indra gave only
long life (आयुर् उत्तमम् 5. 102. 27) to
Sumukha but not अमृत; on obtaining the
boon Sumukha's face shone with brilliance
(लब्ध्वा वरं तु सुमुखः सुमुखः
संबभूव ह 5. 102. 28); having obtained
wife as desired Sumukha went home 5. 102.
23-28; Garuḍa was extremely angry to
know that he was deprived of Sumukha; he

that all birds on mount Meru were of gold
(सौवर्णान् प्रेक्ष्य वायसान्); he therefore

सुरभि
Surabhi1, Surabhī f.: A mythical cow.
A. Origin: (1) Daughter of Dakṣa,
hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 93. 8 (Surabhī);
12. 167. 3; 13. 82. 26; once, (Dakṣa) Pra-
jāpati satisfied with drinking अमृत, emitted
fragrance (सुरभि) while belching; he saw
his daughter Surabhi coming out of his mouth
produced by belching (उद्गारसंवृत्ला)
13. 76. 17, 18; hence described as ‘born of
nectar’ (अमृतसंभवा) 5. 100. 1; (2)
Daughter of Brahman 13. 128. 10 (Surabhī).
B. Description: देवी ‘divine’ 1. 93. 8; 2.
11. 29; 13. 82. 30, 31, 34; 13. 151. 7 and
शुभा, शोभना ‘brilliant, shining’ her
special epithets 3. 10. 8, 15; 12. 167. 3; 13.
82. 29, 31, 37; ‘gentle’ (सौम्या) 13. 151.
7, yet ‘very proud’ (अतिगर्विता) 1. 93, 8;
‘blameless’ (अनिन्दिता) and ‘distinguished’
(महाभागा) 5. 100. 3, 13. 82. 30, 31.
C. Qualities: Surabhi yields nectar as milk
(अमृतधेनुं पयोमुचम्।सा सृष्टा … क्ष-
रमाणा पयोऽमृतम् 13. 128. 10); Surabhi
yields milk after reaching the outskirts of the
Kāñcana mountain on the shore of the ocean
in which flows golden water (कान्चनशैल-
स्य काञ्चनाम्बुवहस्य च। उदधेस् तीरम्
आसाद्य) 5. 108. 10.
D. Progeny: She gave
birth to a cow (Nandinī) by Kaśyapa; Vasiṣṭha
got Nandinī as his होमधेनु 1. 93. 8;
mother of cows (गवाम् माता) 3. 219. 32;
5. 100. 1; mother of cows yielding nectar-
like milk (पयोऽमृतम्) 13. 128. 10; mother
of cows who are themselves mothers of the
world (लोकमातरः) 13. 76. 18; four cows
born to her, Surūpā, Haṃsakā, Subhadrā and
Sarvakāmadughā, dwell in four directions
protecting and guarding them 5. 100. 7-10;
mother of bulls 3. 10. 7.
E. Eminence:
(1) The Goloka granted to Surabhī by Brah-
man stands above the three worlds; as
decreed by Brahman, Surabhī was to get there
all human and divine enjoyments and happi-
ness of dwelling in heaven; her worlds are
provided with all objects of desire and neither
death, nor old age, nor fire steps in there;
neither wretchedness nor inauspiciousness is
met with in the Goloka; the Goloka could be
obtained by mortals only by practising great
austerities and doing good deeds 13. 82. 37-
40; (2) She is mentioned in the दैवत-
वंश narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira;
recitation of this वंश destroys sin 5. 151.
7, 2; (3) She is mentioned among those
who are present in the सभा of Brahmadeva
2. 11. 29.
F. Functions: Residing in
the रसातल, the seventh world of the earth,
she lets milk flow continually which is pro-
duced from the essence of the earth and
which, as a रस, constitutes the essence of
all the six रसस्; out of her milk, falling on
the earth, is created the sea of milk; water of
the ocean that was churned by the gods and
the demons was mixed with the milk of
Surabhi and her four daughters; milk oozing
from Surabhi provides nectar (सुधा) to
those whose food is सुधा, स्वधा for the
manes, and अमृत for those who live on
अमृत 5, 100. 1, 2, 4, 7-13.
G. Events:
(1) Seeing Aditi practising severe austerities,
Surabhi did the same on the peak of the
Kailāsa mountain, standing on one foot and
resorting to the highest योग (परमं
योगम् आस्थिता 13. 82. 28); this she did for ten
thousand and ten hundred years; tormented by
her austerities, gods, big snakes (महोर-
गाः), and sages went to her with Brahman;
Brahman asked her the reason for practising
austerities and granted her a boon; Surabhī
(सुरभ्य् उवाच) did not ask for anything
saying that Brahman's satisfaction with her
austerities was as good as a boon; since
Surabhī (13. 82. 33) practised austerities not
craving for anything (अलोभकाम्यया तपसा
13. 82. 34) Brahman granted her immortality
and a world of her own to be known as Goloka
12. 82. 26 35; this narration forms part of an
old Itihāsa which includes a dialogue between
Pitāmaha and Indra 13. 82. 6; (2) Surabhi
once went to heaven and cried aloud; Indra
took pity on her and asked her why she was
crying; she wept for her son, the bull, who
though weak and emaciated was forced to
draw the plough and was pierced with a goad;
one of the two bulls yoked to the plough was
strong and it carried the yoke ahead of the
other (? एकस् तत्र बलोपेतो धुरम् उद्वहते
ऽधिकाम् 3. 10. 12); the other who was weak
and lean bore the burden with difficulty;
Surabhi grieved because of the torture of the
weak bull; when Indra asked her that while
she had thousands of sons who were tortured
why did she weep over a particular one,
Surabhi replied that all her sons were equal
to her but she had more compassion for the
weak; on hearing what Surabhī (3. 10. 17)
had said Indra realized that a son was
more than one's life; narrating this, Vyāsa
advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to adopt the attitude of
Surabhi and have more sympathy for those
among his sons who were reduced to a
wretched condition (i. e. for the Pāṇḍavas) 3.
10. 5-19; the dialogue between Surabhi and
Indra called a great and excellent आख्यान
(महद् आख्यानम् उत्तमम्।सुरभ्याश्
चैव संवादम् इन्द्रस्य च विशां पते
3. 10. 6); (3) Surabhi, while taking the
oath to prove that she had not stolen the
lotus (पुष्कर) of Agastya said: “let
(the cow) who has stolen your पुष्कर be
milked with her feet tied by the rope made
from बल्वज, the milk-pot used to collect
milk be made of कांस्य, and the calf used
to induce her to give milk be not her own”
13. 96. 41; (4) Surabhi happened to stand
in the sky when the body of Rājadharman
(the king of the cranes) was being cremated
by his Rākṣasa friend; milk streamed from
her udder (सा बभूव पयस्विनी), and foam
from her mouth mixed with milk dropped down
on the body of Rājadharman which brought
him back to life 12. 167. 1-5; (5) Once, froth
from the mouth of Surabhī's (13. 128. 10)
calf fell on Śiva's body; angered, Śiva burnt
all the cows who then became of different
colours; Brahman (लोकगुरु) pacified Śiva
and gave the bull (i. e. that calf) to Śiva
to serve him as vehicle and as a distinguishing
mark on his banner (वृषं चेमं ध्वजा-
र्थं मे ददौ वाहनम् एव च) 13. 128.
11-12.
H. Mahāgraha: She is included
among the afflictions (महाग्रह 3. 219. 41)
which are not favourable to children until
they are sixteen years old and are favourable
afterwards; a bird perches on her head and
eats the children with her 3. 219. 32, 41, 22.

she had assumed the form of an extremely
beautiful girl and attracted the king by her
sweet voice; when she informed the king that
she was a maiden (कन्यास्मि 3. 190. 13),
he expressed his desire to marry her; she
gave her consent on condition (समय
3. 190. 15, 16) that she should not be shown
water; the king agreed and stayed with her
and took her to his town; he sported with
her in isolation and did not attend to any-
thing else; the king then lived with her in a
large forest which was without water (वनम्
इदम् उदारम् अनुदकम् 3. 190 23); it was
got ready for him by his minister; once
while sporting with her the king became
thirsty; they saw a well full of water; when
asked by the king to descend into the well-
water, Suśobhanā entered it and disappeared;
when the king did not see her, he got the well
emptied and saw a frog at the mouth of a
hole; the angered king ordered the killing of
all the frogs; when the frog king Āyu, in the
form of a hermit, requested Parikṣit not to
kill the innocent frogs he said that they had
eaten up his beloved; the frog king then in-
formed king Parikṣit that his beloved was his

many kings before; this was her bad character

Parikṣit told Āyu that he wanted Suśobhanā
and that she might be given back to him; Āyu
gave Suśobhanā to Parikṣit and asked her to
serve the king; he cursed his daughter that

not be good to Brāhmaṇas due to her false-
hood (अब्रह्मण्यानि तवापत्यानि भविष्य-
न्त्य् अनृतकत्वात् तव 3. 190. 40); the king

Stambamitra m.: Name of one of the
four Śārṅgaka birds who survived the Khāṇ-
ḍava fire 1. 219. 40; 1. 220. 1-4.
The ascetic Mandapāla turned into a
Śārṅgaka bird had four sons from the Śārṅ-
gikā Jaritā; Mandapāla left them when they
were still in the eggs, but their mother did
not desert them; she reared them as birds
(स्ववृत्या 1. 220. 19) after they were born;
they all were seers (ऋषि), knowers of Brah-
man, full of lustre and strong; they were able
speakers 1. 220. 17; 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 3;
when the fire began to burn the Khāṇḍava
forest Mandapāla praised Agni and secured
a promise from him not to burn his young ones
1. 220. 5, 16-32; 1. 223. 22-23; 1. 224. 9;
1. 225. 1; Stambamitra's father expected him
to practise austerities when he grew up 1. 221.
9; when the forest fire broke out the Śārṅgaka
young ones had not developed wings and feet
(अबर्हाश् चरणैर् हीनाः 1. 221. 4, 18); as
the fire drew near they advised their mother
to abandon them and fly to a safe place;
she, on her part, advised them to creep into
the hole of a mouse to save themselves from
fire; they did not agree since they were
afraid of the mouse; when the young ones
were not prepared to enter the hole even
when assured by their mother that the mouse
was taken away by a falcon, she left them to
their fate 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-16; as the
fire drew close the three younger Śārṅgaka
birds entreated the eldest one, Jarṅāri, to do
something to rescue them; on that occasion
Stambamitra said to his brother: “The eldest
is the protection, the eldest releases from
difficulty; if the eldest does not know (what
to do), what shall the younger one do ?”
(1. 223. 4); when the young Śārṅgaka birds
began to praise god fire in turns, Stamba-
mitra, when his turn arrived, said: “Oh
Agni, you are the only one, and this whole
world stands in you; you hold the beings
and you bear the world; you carry the ob-
lation, and wise men worship you as one and
as manifold; after creating these worlds,
you digest them when time arrives; you are
the source of this world and its mainstay;
oh lord of the world, you digest the food
eaten by the living beings” (1. 223. 12-15);
when the fire subsided the mother of the
Śarṅgaka birds returned to them 1. 224. 17;
sage Mandapāla also was anxious about the
safety of Stambamitra and the rest and he
returned to them; he was not greeted by the

23; 3. 266. 65; he specially became friendly
with Sugrīva 3. 147. 26.
E. Meeting
with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on
the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in
search of heavenly lotus flowers having
heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his
conch near the thicket of banana trees; hear-
ing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the
big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep
in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he
hit the ground with his large tail which looked
like the flag staff of Indra and produced
sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched
forward to search the source of this sound
he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stone-
slab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146.
59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 65-
71; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant
opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly
at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke
him up who was happily asleep; he told
Bhīma that as an intelligent human being
Bhīma should have shown compassion for
other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know
his धर्म; Hanūmant then asked Bhīma
the purpose of his arriving at a place which
was not supposed to be visited by human
beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could
not be crossed unless one had acquired per-
fection (सिद्धगति 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant
advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits
to be found there which were as good as
अमृत and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma
introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇ-
ḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded
with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather
than proceed further and meet with danger;
when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed
and for that purpose Hanūmant should get
away from his path, Hanūmant replied that
it was not possible for him to move as he was
suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must pro-
ceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma
said he was prepared to go beyond him and
the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the
ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that
Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant
was his brother, meritorious, brave and in-
telligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed
the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing
Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of
his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he
could not move due to old age Bhīma should
set aside his tail from the path and proceed;
Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail
and stood with his face turned down due to
shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking
for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant
to reveal his identity and let him know whether
he was a सिद्ध, a god, a Gandharva, or a
Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147.
17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he
really was and that he used to live with
Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since
the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin
3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma
that he had gone out with other crores of
monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed
by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had
then jumped over the ocean, one hundred
योजनस् wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house,
and returned after announcing himself to
Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for
Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following
boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the
story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted
to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the
narrative of Rāma (तस्य वीरस्य चरितम्
3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant
again told Bhīma that no mortal could go
beyond the point where they met since it was
frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed
Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the
should be attacked or cursed by some one, and
that the lake he was searching for was close
by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant
that he was highly blessed by his meeting with
Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the
unrivalled form which he had assumed when he
leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would
believe what Hanūmant had told about him-
self; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was
not possible to assume forms of the bygone age;
one acquired the strength, form and prowess
according to the युग in which one lived; he
had to follow the (rule of the) युग, since no
one could go beyond Time (युगे युगे।बल-
वर्ष्मप्रभावा हि प्रहीयन्त्य् उद्भवन्ति
च … युगं समनुवर्तामि कालो हि दुर-
तिक्रमः 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted
in his request, Hanūmant increased his body
immensely to look like mountain Maināka
and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed
to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description
of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant
told Bhīma that he could grow even more,
as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested
Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3.
149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma
asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rā-
vaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā,
Hanūmant told him that if he had killed
Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3.
149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma
to depart and showed him the way leading
to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of
Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the
flowers himself and asked him to show regard
for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act
rashly but follow the धर्म 3. 149. 21-24;
Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on
धर्म to Bhīma (explaining to him त्रयी,
वार्ता and दण्डनीति; the duties of the four
वर्णस्; the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52;
Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced
Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue;
with faltering voice and tears in his eyes
Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and
not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having
embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was
happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant
offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished
Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the
sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with
a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanū-
mant that he (H.) had already done all that he
could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only
asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour;
the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their
support which would help them to win the war;
hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to
brotherly feelings and friendliness (भ्रातृत्वात्
सौहृदाच् चापि 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma
roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his
roar to it and increase its volume; he would
stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar
which would deprive the enemies of their
lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described
as marked by a monkey (वानर, कपि,
शाखामृग, but the monkey is not named
Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7,
9, 20, 27; 6. 67. 3; 6. 78. 9; 6. 112. 114; 7.
9. 14; 7. 17. 21; 7. 80. 8, 9 (the monkey
terrified the army of the Kauravas); 7. 80.
29; 7. 102. 6; 7. 114. 81; 9. 9. 59; 10. 12.
25; 14. 51. 54; 14. 82. 29; 14. 83. 12, 23.
so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150.
14-15.
F. Meeting with Rāma and the fight
between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśya-
mūka mountain and saw five monkeys,
Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva,
approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first
talked with Hanūmant and then approached
Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264.
9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and
Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish
between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland
round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33.
G. Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā,
when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs
were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on
way they rested in the मधुवन; Sugrīva
interpreted this behaviour (प्रणय 3. 266.
28) as indicating that Hanūmant and others
were successful in their mission; the monkey-
chiefs who had gone for the search then
approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva
3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of
Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood
that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed
Rāma that he had brought the good tidings;
he then described to Rāma his search for
Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the
female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the
Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṃpāti and
obtaining from him the information that
Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that
Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one
was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant
did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu:
ततः पितरम् आविश्य पुप्लुवे ऽहं माहार्-
णवम्) and killing on way an acquatic
Rākṣasī (जलराक्षसी) 3. 266. 57; in
Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner
apartment of Rāvaṇa (तत्र सीता मया
दृष्टा रावणान्तःपुरे सती 3. 266. 58);
having determined her identity Hanūmant
approached her and told her that he was the
son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma;
he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being;
he assured her that he was a monkey and
not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon
arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told
him that she knew him already to be Hanū-
mant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa
Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and
permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma
that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him
the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a
crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant
then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma
3. 266. 58-68.
H. Encounter with indi-
vidual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa:
Hanūmant marched at the head of the army
when it started towards the sea in the south
3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa
attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanū-
mant rushed towards him; this act inspired
confidence in the monkeys; the fight between
the two was fierce like the one between Indra
and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant
with maces (गदा) and clubs (परिघ),
and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally
Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with
his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7,
12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in
fighting with the demons Vajravega and
and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajra-
vega and killed him with the summit of a
mountain (अद्रिशृङ्ग) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant
was among the monkey-chiefs who watched
over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell
down on the ground tied with the arrows of
Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who
applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes
which enabled them to see invisible beings 3.
273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkey-
chiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at
Rāma 3. 274. 3.
I. Sītā's boon: At the
time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave
Hanūmant the following boon: “You will
live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts (राम-
कीर्त्या समं पुत्र जीवितं ते भवीष्यति),
and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait
on you” 3. 275. 43-44.
J. Messenger to
Bharata: When Rāma approached the city
of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as
his messenger to give him the good news
(of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came
back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3.
275. 59-60.

Harika m.: Name of an ichneumon.
Described as ‘looking like the blossom

30), mobile, and having red eyes; when the
mouse Palita was tasting the piece of flesh,
he saw below his deadly enemy, the ichneumon
Harika, lying in the crevice of the earth;
the ichneumon came out quickly as he got
the scent of the mouse, looked up, and
licked his mouth for food 12. 136. 30-31;
(the mouse also noticed Candraka an owl,
his another enemy, up in the nest on the
branch of the tree 12. 136. 32); the mouse
thus faced danger from the ichneumon and
the owl at the same time; he realized that
Harika would catch him if he rushed to the
ground to save himself from the owl 12.
136. 33, 37; the mouse therefore decided to
take refuge with the cat, his third enemy,
who was trapped in the net; the mouse pointed
out to the cat the danger he was facing
owing to the evil intention of the ichneumon
and the owl; he offered to cut the threads of
the trap in which the cat was caught provided
the cat offered him protection from Harika
and Candraka 12. 136. 72-73; the cat agreed
and when Harika and Candraka saw the
mouse confidently resting on the body of the
cat, they lost hopes of getting the mouse and
returned to their respective homes 12. 136. 82.

आग्नेयास्त्र
Āgneyāstra1 nt.: Name of a missile;
referred to as Āgni-astra in उभे चैवाग्नि-
मारुते 5. 140. 6.
A. Origin and succession: Arjuna
told Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa that Bṛhaspati
gave it first to Bharadvāja, Bharadvāja to
sage Agniveśya, Agniveśya to Droṇa, and
Droṇa to Arjuna 1. 158. 26-27; 1. 121. 6-7;
but Arjuna told Uttara that he obtained
Āgneyāstra from god Agni 4. 56. 14; when
Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa expressed his desire
to learn the अस्त्र, Arjuna taught it to him in
exchange of the Gandharva horses (गन्धर्-
वजाः … हयाः 1. 158. 51) 1. 158. 54-55;
Arjuna taught it to the Gandharva with due
rites (यथाविधि) 1. 174. 3; when Arjuna
requested Indra for heavenly weapons, Indra
assured him that he would give him all the
heavenly missiles, आग्नेय and the rest
(आग्नेयानि च सर्वाणि) after Arjuna had
satisfied god Mahādeva 1. 225. 12, 10; among
the epic heroes, besides Droṇa and Arjuna,
its use was known also to Kṛṣṇa (6. 116. 38;
also see Āgneyāstra2), Bhīṣma, Karṇa and
Aśvatthāman (7. 166. 2) [See the section C
below].
B. Description: divine (दिव्य)
6. 116. 38; 7. 73. 46; very dreadful (महा-

अपि सुदुर्धर्षम्) 7. 172. 14.
C. Its
use in war and its effects: 1. In the epic
war: (i) when used by Karṇa against
Arjuna, it gave to Karṇa's bow a fiery
look and it released fiery arrows; Arjuna
apparently combated it with the same kind of
अस्त्र (अस्त्रं अस्त्रेण संवार्य) 7. 31. 51-
52; (ii) used by Droṇa against Yuyudhāna
(Sātyaki); this was combated by Sātyaki
with Vāruṇāstra 7. 73. 46; (iii) Bhāradvāja
(Droṇa) used Āgneya and other heavenly
missiles against Yudhiṣṭhira which were ren-
dered ineffective by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 29-30;
(iv) Aśvatthāman used it against Arjuna;
when released, it produced a shower of
arrows (शरवर्षम् अजायत 7. 172. 16;
शरवृष्टयः 7. 172. 22); cold winds blew, sun
lost its lustre, clouds rained blood, all beings
became restless; the arrows were fiery and
produced good deal of heat; they burnt down
enemies, elephants, horses and chariots; the
god Fire burnt the army like the Saṃvartaka
fire at the end of the aeon 7. 172. 16-27; the
whole army, including Arjuna, could not be
seen due to the darkness; the like of the अस्त्र
released by Aśvatthāman was never seen
before by Saṃjaya and his colleagues 7. 172.
30-31; Arjuna combated it with Brāhma Astra
7. 172. 14, 32; it was meant to be used by
Arjuna in the war 5. 140. 6 (here referred to
as Āgni instead of Āgneya). 2. Outside
the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it against
Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa; when released, it
burnt down the excellent chariot of Aṅgāra-
parṇa, and he fell down, head downwards, as
he swooned due to the lustre of the missile 1.
158. 28, 29, 37; (ii) used by Droṇa (besides
using other divine missiles) against Arjuna at
the time of the cattle-raid; Arjuna combated
it with his Āgneyāstra 4. 53. 48; (iii) on the
same occasion used by Bhīṣma and Arjuna
against each other to combat each other's
missiles 4. 59. 21; (iv) in his fight with
Citrasena and the Gandharvas Arjuna killed
thousands of Gandharvas with Āgneyāstra
3. 234. 7; when released once again, the
Gandharvas, afflicted by heat, were dejected
3. 234. 17; (v) at the time of displaying
his skill in the use of missiles, Arjuna
produced fire by releasing Āgneyāstra 1. 125.
19; (vi) employed by Bhīṣma against
Rāma (Jāmadagnya); it was rendered in-
effective by the counter-use of Vāruṇāstra
5. 181. 12.
D. Mode of use: The normal
arrows were supposed to be infused by this
अस्त्र (अस्त्रे ते वारुणाग्नेये ताभ्यां
बाणसमाहिते 7. 73. 48) by reciting मन्त्रस्
over it (अनुमन्त्र्य 5. 181. 12, अभिमन्त्र्य
7. 172. 15); Aśvatthāman also sipped water
(वार्य् उपस्पृश्य 7. 172. 14) before reciting
मन्त्रस्।
E. Status: Inferior to Śivā's
Pāśupatāstra 13. 14. 127.

but apparently identical with Brahmaśiras
(10. 12. 4, 40).
Described as a ‘powerful missile’
(परमास्त्र) 10. 13. 17; 10. 15. 12, 23, 33;
10. 16. 8; ‘heavenly’ (दिव्य) 10. 15. 16,
25; ‘unparalleled’ (दुरासद) 10. 15. 16;
‘fierce’ (घोर) 10. 15. 11; ‘unfailing’

ing big flames and surrounded by a circle

वृतम्) 10. 14. 8; when challenged by
Bhīma, who was followed by Arjuna and
Yudhiṣṭhira in a chariot, driven by Kṛṣṇa,
Aśvatthāman took a reed (इषीका) in the left
hand (सवेय्न पाणिना) and thought of the
heavenly missile, recited मन्त्रस् on it to
imbibe it with the lustre of fire (वह्नितेजो
ऽनुमन्त्र्य वै 10. 15. 16), and released it
for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas (अपाण्ड-
वाय 10. 13. 18; 10. 15. 16); fire broke out
from the reed which threatened to burn the
three worlds 10. 13. 15-20; to counter it,
Arjuna released Brahmaśiras (10. 15. 23)
saying ‘let the missile be pacified by missile’
(अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण शाम्यताम्) 10. 14. 2-6;
10. 15. 20; (however, according to 1. 1. 155
Arjuna said ‘स्वस्ति’ while releasing his
missile); apprehending great danger to the
creatures from the fire released by the two
missiles, Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
stood between them and appealed to the
two heroes to withdraw their missiles since
they were never used by any one before 10.
14. 7-16; accordingly, Arjuna withdrew it
(10. 15. 1, 5, 10), but Aśvatthāman could not
withdraw it (10. 15. 11) and he admitted to
the sages his inability to follow their advice
10. 15. 15; he said the missile must achieve its
purpose and destroy all the sons of Pāṇḍu 10.
15. 17; but Vyāsa pointed out that if Aśvat-
thāman's परमास्त्र were to subdue Arjuna's
Brahmaśiras there would be no rain in the
land for twelve years; (however, according to
1. 1. 155 one अस्त्र was pacified by the other
अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण शान्तम्); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
therefore asked again Aśvatthāman to with-
draw his missile and save the nation and the
Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 25-26; but since the missile
could not be totally withdrawn, Aśvatthāman
suggested that the missile should fall, not on
the Pāṇḍavas, but on their foetus (इषीका
निपतिष्यति।गर्भेषु पाण्डवेयानाम् 10.
15. 31); when permitted by Vyāsa to do that,
Aśvatthāman directed the missile to the
foetus 10. 15. 32-33; it was then destined to
hit the foetus in the womb of Uttarā 10. 16.
7-8 [See Aiṣikāstra and Brahmaśiras].

38; but it was known to Droṇa 7. 166. 2;
Mādhava (Sātyaki) learnt it from Vijaya
(Arjuna) 6. 78. 39; it was once used even
by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 32.
B. Description:
heavenly (दिव्य) 4. 58. 8, an excellent
missile (अस्त्रवर 6. 55. 120; उत्तमास्त्र 6.

37. 31; (उद् ईरय) 6. 77. 40.
D. Effect: Its
primary effect was to produce a shower of
arrows by releasing a single arrow 6. 55. 111,
(120); 6. 77. 41; 6. 78. 37, 40; 7. 68. 21;
8. 19. 22; 8. 37. 31; 8. 66. 49; (4. 58. 9);
the arrows became hard like वज्र 3. 168.
2; the arrows (due to the effect of the
मन्त्रस्) became lustrous (तेजोमया बाणाः)
8. 66. 50, or appeared like bright fire (विम-
लाग्निवर्ण) 6. 55. 111; when released the
missile gave rise to a wonderful sight in
the mid-region (प्रादुश्चकाराद्भुतम् अन्त-
रिक्षे 6. 55. 110).
E. Its use (princi-
pally by Arjuna): (1) In the epic
war: (i) When Arjuna was attacked by
Bhīṣma, Duryodhana, Bhūriśravas and Śalya,
he put to use the Māhendra astra by
forcefully drawing the Gāṇḍīva bow 6.
55. 106-110; (ii) when Arjuna was sur-
rounded by thousands of kings (राजस-
हस्राणि 6. 77. 32) and his normal arrows
were not enough to ward off their arrows,
Arjuna brought forth his Aindra astra and
successfully repelled the arrows of the
enemies 6. 77. 40-41; (iii) when Arjuna
was attacked by Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus
who showered arrows on the right and left of
Arjuna and attacked him with तोमर and
शूल respectively, Arjuna manifested Śākra
astra to take care of the weapons of the
enemies and kill both of them 7. 68. 7-13,
21; (iii) when attacked by the Saṃśaptakas
all together, Arjuna manifested Aindra astra
to cut down all sorts of weapons of the
enemies as also to cut off their limbs and
chariots 8. 19. 22-29; (iv) when Arjuna
was severely struck on his chest by Suśar-
man, he produced Aindra astra 8. 37. 30-31;
(v) used by Arjuna to combat Karṇa's
Brahmāstra 8. 66. 48-50; (vi) used by
Arjuna to combat the Aindra astra used by
Droṇa 7. 163. 28; (vii) used, together with
Vāyavya, by Droṇa against Yudhiṣṭhira; the
latter combated both of them with Māhendra
astra 7. 132. 31, 32; (viii) used by Sātyaki
to fight with the demon Alambusa; it reduced
to ashes the माया employed by the demon
6. 78. 40; (2) Outside the epic war:
(i) During the cattle raid, when Arjuna
was attacked by Kṛpa, Karṇa and Droṇa with
heavenly missiles, Arjuna released the Aindra
astra; he covered the enemies with arrows as
the sun would do with his rays 4. 58. 8-9;
(ii) when Arjuna was attacked by the
Nīvātakavacas with showers of huge rocks,
Arjuna released it (Indrāstra) and the वज्र-
like arrows released by the missile, pounded
the rocks hurled by the enemies to pieces by

13. 61. 24 [किंकर इति दण्डस्य नाम
Comm. of an unidentified author, see Cr. Ed.
Vol. 17. Part II. Critical Notes p. 1079];
but Kiṃkara and Daṇḍa of Mṛtyu seem to be
different (perhaps किंकर = पाश, see end of
this entry); Bhīma would fight even with
Mṛtyu equipped with Kiṃkara and Daṇḍa
(किंकरोद्यतदण्डेन (?) मृत्युनापि व्रजेद्
रणम्) 8. 34 20; Duryodhana with his raised
गदा compared with Yama with his hand
raised with Kiṃkara (वैवस्वतम् इव क्रुद्-
धं किंकरोद्यतपाणिनम्) 9. 31. 47 [but
Nī. on 8. 50. 24 (Bom. Ed.) करेण्च्द्यतो
दण्डो येन तेन मृत्युना समः।किंशब्द
उपमार्थे); Yama equipped with Kiṃkara
came to take away Satyavān (सुप्तं चैनं
यमः साक्षाद् उपागच्छत् सकिंकरः) 3.
282. 38; Yama came to take away Satyavān
with पाश in hand (पाशहस्त) 3. 281. 9;
Satyavān bound by the पाश 3. 281. 16, and
later released 3. 281. 54; hence किंकर
likely to be the same as पाश। [See Daṇḍa].

Droṇa took charge of the Kaurava army and
arranged his army the Śakaṭa way; in the
front of the Pāṇḍava army were Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa (व्यूहप्रम्न्खतः 7. 6. 16; अग्रतः
7. 6. 20; बलसेनाग्रगौ 7. 6. 21) 7. 6. 15-21.

गरुड
Garuḍa (Suparṇa) m.: Name of a
particular arrangement of the army (व्यूह),
described as महाव्यूह 6. 52. 2; also called
Suparṇa 7. 19. 4, which is described as
‘superhuman’ (अतिमानुष) and ‘invincible
by the enemies’ (अजय्यम् अरिभिः) 7. 19. 21.
1. On the third day of the war Bhīṣma
arranged the Kaurava army according to the
Garuḍavyūha; at its ‘beak’ (तुण्ड) stood
Bhīṣma himself; its ‘eyes’ (चक्षुषी) were
Droṇa and Kṛtavarman; Aśvatthāman and
Kṛpa, supported by the Trigartas, Matsyas,
Kaikayas and Vāṭadhānas, formed the ‘head’
(शीर्ष); at its ‘neck’ (ग्रीवा) were
stationed Bhūriśravas, Śala, Śalya, Bhaga-
datta, Jayadratha, and the Madrakas, the
Sindhusauvīras and the Pañcanadas; at its
‘back’ (पृष्ठ) was king Duryodhana
with his brothers and followers; the ‘tail’
(पुच्छ) was made up by Vinda, Anuvinda,
the Kāmboja, and the Śakas, as well as
the Śūrasenas; the Māgadhas, the Kaliṅgas
and the Dāśerakas stood at the right wing
(दक्षिण पक्ष), while on the left (वाम
पक्ष) were the Kānanas, the Vikuñjas, the
Muktas, and the Puṇḍrāviṣes together with
Bṛhadbala 6. 52. 3-9; 2. On the twelfth
day of the war Droṇa arranged the Kaurava
army according to the Suparṇa (Garuḍa)
व्यूह; at its entrance (मुख) stood
Droṇa; its ‘head’ (शिरस्) was Duryodhana
with his brothers and followers; its ‘eyes’
(चक्षुषी) were Kṛtavarman and Gautama
(Kṛpa), together with Bhūtavarman, Kṣema-
śarman, Karakarṣa, and the warriors from the
Kaliṅga and other countries; at its ‘neck’
(ग्रीवा) were Śūrasenas, Daradas and others
with their armies consisting of elephants,
chariots, horsemen and foot-soldiers; Bhūri-
śravas, Śala, Śalya, Somadatta and Bāhlika
with an army consisting of one अक्षौहिणी
formed the right wing (दक्षिण पक्ष);
Vinda and Anuvinda of the Avanti country,
and Sudakṣiṇa from the Kamboja occupied the
left wing (वाम पक्ष), and took positions
in front of Aśvatthāman; at the ‘back’
(पृष्ठ) of the व्यूह were the Kaliṅgas,
the Ambaṣṭhas and others; at the ‘tail’
(पुच्छ) was Karṇa with his sons and
relatives; Jayadratha, Bhīmaratha and other
heroes stood ‘above’ (?) the व्यूह (व्यूह-
स्योपरि) 7. 19. 5-14; the व्यूह looked
like an ocean tossed by wind 7. 19. 15;
from its wings and ends of wings rushed
(elephants) eager to fight; in the midst
of this army of elephants stood the king of
Prāgjyotiṣa (Bhagadatta) mounted on an
elephant duly prepared for fight; Bhagadatta
was surrounded by many kings from moun-
tain countries (पार्वतीयैः समन्वितः) 7.
19. 16-20.

गाण्डीव
Gāṇḍīva, Gāṇḍiva nt.: Name of
Arjuna's bow (Gāṇḍiva recognized by
Kāśikā on P. 5. 2. 110, but very likely it
occurs म्। च्।).
A. Etymology: So called because it
was made of गाण्डी, i. e. the bow was
covered with the skin of rhinoceros (?), or
because it was made of the backbone of rhin-
oceros (?) (एष गाण्डीमयश् चापः … यतस्
तद् गाण्डिवं धनुः 5. 96. 19; cf. गाण्डी
खड्गाख्यः पशुविशेषः।तस्य विकारो
गाण्डीमयः।तस्य हि पशूनां वा पृष्ठ-
वंशस्य धनुः कर्तुं शक्यम् यतः
गाण्डीमयत्वाद् एव तद् गाण्डीवं नाम
धनुर् अभूत्। … गाण्डी वज्रग्रन्थिस् तन्-
मय इत्य् अन्ये (= Sarvajñanārāyaṇa) Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 98. 19).
B. Origin: It
was created by Brahman in very old times
(पुरा) 1. 216. 17; 8. 50. 56; Indra fastened
an undecaying (अजरा) string on it when
Arjuna got ready to fight the Nivātakavacas
3. 165. 14; (however, Aśvatthāman cut it
off and Arjuna had to put a new string on
it 4. 54. 8).
C. History: After its
creation, Brahman first held it for 1000
years, and then it was held successively by
Prajāpati for 800 years (?) or 503 years (?)
(त्रीणि पञ्चशतं चैव), by Śakra for 85
years, by Soma for 500 years, by Varuṇa
for 100 years, and, up to the beginning
of the अज्ञातवास, it was with Arjuna for
65 years 4. 38. 39-41; it lay in the Varuṇa-
loka, perhaps in Varuṇa's lake, and was
guarded there by the gods 5. 96. 19; hence the
how was considered as properly belonging to
Varuṇa (वारुणं गाण्डिवम्) 5. 155. 5;
(5. 59. 12); at the time of burning the
Khāṇḍava forest, Agni asked Varuṇa to give
Gāṇḍīva, which he had received from Soma,
to Arjuna since he was to perform great feats
with it; Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request 1.
216. 3-4; (17. 1. 39); when Arjuna received
it, he bowed to Agni, held the bow firmly, and
strung it; at that time there was a loud noise
1. 216. 17-20; 1. 55. 37; 3. 157. 20; 5. 155. 7;
according to another version Arjuna received
the bow, not before, but after he satisfied
god Fire 2. 44. 5; 8. 57. 41; Śaṅkara told
Arjuna that the Ganḍīva he now held was the
same which her as Nara, had used to chastise
the Daityas at the time of Indra's अभिषेक
3. 41. 3-4.
D. Association of Gāṇḍīva
with Arjuna 1. 1. 123; 5. 136. 5; it was
considered very suitable for Arjuna 2. 3. 6;
3. 41. 4; 8. 31. 55; hence Arjuna has epithets
like गाण्डीवधन्वन् 2. 54. 22; 3 34. 6; 3.

and Piśācas (दितिजपिशाचसूदन) 3. 41. 25;
producing big sound (महाघोष) 4. 5. 17
(see the next Section F); whose heaviness
caused pounding as by वज्र (वज्रनिष्पेष-
गौरव) 3. 12. 40 (वज्रेण निष्पेषश् चूर्णी-
भावो यस्य पर्वतस्य तद्वत् गौरवं
गुरुत्वं यस्य Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 11 40);

22; 5. 155. 30; (दीप्यमानम् इवाकाशे)
6. 112. 113; having the lustre of the
sun (अर्कवर्चस्) 4. 38. 17; a stretched
Gāṇḍīva compared with lightning, fire, and
Indra's weapon (यथा बलाहके विद्युत्
पावको वा शिलोच्चये।तथा गाण्डीवम्

11; (गाण्डीवेन्द्रायुधोज्ज्वल) 3. 84. 11;
Gāṇḍīva counted among the three forces
(तेजांसि) that came together on Arjuna's
chariot (the other two being Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna himself) 5. 51. 11; it caused the
territory to prosper (राष्त्रवर्धन) 1.
216. 6; 4. 38. 6, 38; it spread the name and
fame of its possessor (यशःकीर्तिविवर्धन)
1. 216. 5; none of the Kauravas had a
bow to match with Gāṇḍīva—that was
Dhṛtarāṣṭra's regret 5. 51. 12; according to
Karṇa, however, his bow (Vijaya) superior
to Gāṇḍīva 8. 22. 39.
F. Big sound:
Famous for the big sound it produced,
i. e. the sound produced by the string while
striking against the forearm of Arjuna
(ज्याघोष 3. 40. 9; ज्यानिनाद 7. 65. 14;
ज्यातलनिर्घोष 6. 116. 20; मौर्व्यास् तल-
निष्पेषम् 5. 47. 47; ज्यया समाहत्य तले
भृशं च 8. 60. 12), which filled all direc-
tions, reached the sky, shook the earth, and,
being unbearable, caused fear in the minds
of hearers, especially the opponents; the
sound often referred to as निर्घोष or घोष
2. 72. 32; 4. 41. 14, 18; 4. 57. 10; 4.
61. 9, 27; 5. 47. 58; 5. 140. 7; 6. 45. 16;
6. 67. 2, 11; 6. 74. 30; 6. 116. 20; 7. 3. 14,
15, 19; 7. 9. 23; 7. 29. 31, 32; 7. 65. 15
(elephants frightened); 7. 85. 37; 7. 102.
6; 7. 114. 91; 8. 27. 48; 8. 37. 1; 8. 59. 15;
8. 60. 12; 9. 3. 19, 33; 9. 27. 61; or as
महास्वन, निस्वन or स्वन 4. 40. 25;
4. 41. 15; 4. 48. 2; 5. 136. 26; 6. 55. 114;
6. 56. 26 (निर्ह्रादमहास्वन); 6. 108. 14;
7. 145. 44, 45; 8. 58. 13 (भैरवस्वन);
8. 67. 19; or as प्रणाद, निनद 6. 55. 116;
7. 65. 14; 7. 145. 46; or as निर्हाद 6.
56. 26; 14. 72. 15 (भीमनिर्हाद); or as
शब्द 4. 40. 27; 4. 41. 16; 5. 26. 24; 5. 47.
47; 6. 55. 113, 115; 7. 9. 19; 7. 51. 40;
7. 95. 9; or by the verb रस्- 7. 3. 19;
sound compared with the roar of a thunder
(विस्फूर्जितम् इवाशनेः) 3. 48. 9; 4. 48. 5;
4. 57. 10; 5. 140. 7; 6. 116. 20; 7. 3. 15;
8. 26. 29; 3. 252. 17, 5. 23. 20 (स्तनयित्नु-
घोष); 6. 55. 105 (स्तनयित्नुकल्प); 5.
47. 47 (वज्रनिष्पेषतुल्य); or with the
roar of a cloud (प्रावृड्जलदनिस्वन) 7.
9. 23; 3. 41. 3; hearing (or non-hearing)
the sound meant different things on different
occasions: (1) hearing it Droṇa knew Arjuna
was proceeding towards Bhīṣma 6. 108. 14;
(2) Karṇa inferred that Arjuna must have
killed the Śibis and the Pauravas 7. 145. 45-
46; (3) Sātyaki concluded that Arjuna must
be nearby 7. 95. 9; (4) it became a rally-
ing point to Virāṭa, Drupada and other kings
6. 55. 115; (5) when not heard, Yudhiṣṭhira
became anxious about Arjuna's safety 7. 85.
37; 7. 102. 6; (6) Arjuna made the twang
of his bow (गाण्डीवं प्राक्षिपत् पाऋथः)
to express joy at the defeat of Karṇa by
Bhīma 7. 104. 31.
G. Use by Arjuna:
1. Besides Arjuna, the bow (Gāṇḍiva)
could be strung only by Bhīma and Kṛṣṇa
3. 13. 69; but it was, in fact, used only by
Arjuna, hence blame could attach to
Gāṇḍiva of Arjuna if it was not used against
Duryodhana 3. 13. 70; 4. 20. 1; Arjuna's
association with Gāṇḍīva and dependence of
Pāṇḍavas' victory on it often stressed 1. 216
29; 2. 66. 12; 3. 6. 9; 4. 5. 17; 4. 38. 37;
5. 124. 2; 8. 69. 24; Arjuna owed a debt to
his bow from which he would be free by
killing Karṇa 8. 52. 23; Arjuna could wield
the bow with both hands equally dexterously
(उभौ मे दक्षिणौ पाणी गाण्डीवस्य
विकर्षणे), hence he was called Savyasācin
4. 39. 17; 4. 56. 4; 4. 59. 12; 7. 51. 40;
Arjuna cleaned the bow-string and the bow
before use 8. 52. 2 (ज्याम् अनुमृज्य);
7. 18. 9 (गाण्डीवम् उपसमृज्य); left
unstrung when it was not to be used for
a long time (अपज्यम् अकरोत्) 4. 5. 17;
when not held in hand (and left unstrung)
Gāṇḍīva gaped (अनालब्धं जृम्भति
गाण्डिवं धनुः) 5. 47. 96; before putting
an arrow to the bow, Arjuna just touched
it (i. e. touched the bow-string) 8. 57. 15
(संस्पृशन् गाण्डिवं धनुः), or stretched
it with force (बलवत् 7. 78. 36) (व्य्-आ-क्षिप्-,
वि-क्षिप्-, प्रा-क्षिप्-) so that it produced big
sound 4. 40. 24-27; 6. 114. 43; 6. 116. 19;
7. 51. 40; 7. 80. 35; 7. 104. 31; 8. 32. 7;
8. 52. 2; 9. 13. 26; 9. 17. 6; 9. 18. 64; 14.
72. 8; 14. 74. 4; (वि-स्फारय-) 7. 78. 36;
8. 21. 15; (आ-यम्-) 7. 80. 31; while shoot-
ing arrows, Arjuna shook it (दोधूयमान,
(वि)धूयमान, (वि)धुन्वन्) 4. 48. 2; 5.
23. 20; 5. 47. 47; 6. 65. 9; 7. 53. 20; 7. 64.
18; 9. 3. 21; when moved in a circle it
looked like a firebrand (अलात) 9. 3. 20;
(अग्निचक्र) 4. 59. 12; or like a lightning
(विद्युत्) 9. 3. 21, and Arjuna looked like the
sun at the end of the aeon (युगान्त) 8.
57. 55; it as if flew in all directions like a
lightning 4. 58. 11; Arjuna recited मन्त्रस्
on Gāṇḍīva, (the bow-string, and the arrows)
on special occasions: (1) while releasing the
वज्र-like arrows by employing the वज्र
missile of Indra against the Nivātakavacas
(अनुमन्त्र्य च गाण्डीवम्) 3. 169. 13-
14; (2) while shooting three arrows to
produce a pillow for Bhīṣma (आमन्त्र्य
गाण्डीवम्) 6. 115. 41, and (3) to procure
water from the earth for Bhīṣma (शरं
दीप्तम् अभिमन्त्र्य) 6. 116. 19-23; (4)
while using Aindrāstra to combat the Brah-
māstra of Karṇa (गाण्डीवं ज्यां च
बाणांश् च अनुमन्त्र्य धनंजयः।
असृजच् छरवर्षाणि) 8. 66. 49; Arjuna
called मन्त्रविद् when be made a sort of
सत्यक्रिया (अनेन सत्येन निहन्त्व् अयं
शरः) while shooting the arrow that killed
Karṇa 8. 67. 19-20; 2. After receiving
Gāṇḍīva from Varuṇa Arjuna must have
used it on all occasions; specific mention of
arrows or missiles released (or to be released)
from Gāṇḍīva (which went straight to the
target) is found at 3. 34. 83; 3. 172. 5; 3.
252. 18; 4. 45. 23-24; 4. 52. 8; 4. 55. 21;
4. 60. 13; 5. 23. 20; 5. 47. 48, (55, 58);
7. 65. 16; 7. 68. 5, 33; 7. 120. 85; 7. 145.
50; 8. 12. 38; 8. 21. 15-17; 8. 42. 46; 8.

14; 14. 83. 30; 14. 85. 5, 15; 16. 9. 21;
no one realized the time that elapsed
between Arjuna's drawing out the arrow
from the quiver, his putting it to the
bow, and discharging it from Gāṇḍīva 4.
57. 19; hence the arrows sped like mind
or wind (मनोनिलसमा जवे) 7. 53. 42;
(अतिवेगवन्तः) 3. 252. 17; (शीघ्रवेगान्)
3. 252. 18; they appeared to follow each
other in close succession (संसक्ता यान्ति
सायकाः) 5. 164. 4; they appeared like the
rows of bees (and this was highly thought
of by Mātali) 3. 167. 22, or like a swarm
of moths (3. 252. 18); or like the rows of
swans in the sky 7. 121. 3; the arrows
released from Gāṇḍīva had the impact of
the thunderbolt of Indra (इन्द्राशनिसम-
स्पर्शाः) 9. 23. 55; 9. 24. 2; 3. 169. 15
(वज्रचोदिता बाणाः); or they shone like a
lightning (वज्राशनिसमप्रभान्) 14. 78.
27; (अशनिप्राकाशैः) 4. 49. 22; the arrows
released from Gāṇḍīva were burning and pro-
duced fire 5. 56. 27; 5. 141. 42; 8. 52. 32;
4. 45. 23; 8. 46. 42; [also see the following
section]; 3. Specific mention of the bow:
Arjuna must have used Gāṇḍīva on all
occasions (5. 53. 1) starting from its use
when Arjuna helped god Fire to burn the
Khāṇḍava forest (1. 217-219); the bow is
specifically mentioned by name when Arjuna
got ready to fight with Kirmīra 3. 12. 40;
started off to meat Indra to acquire heavenly
weapons 3. 38. 15; lifted it to shoot at the
boar (Daitya Mūka) 3. 40. 9; fought with
Kirāta (Śaṅkara) 3. 40. 29; in this fight
the bow (not named) was swallowed by
Śaṅkara 3. 40. 39-40, and then returned to
Arjuna 3. 41. 4, 25; used while fighting
with the Nivātakavacas 3. 167. 6, 22; 3.
168. 23; 3. 169. 2; with Kālakeyas 3.
170. 40, 50; (at the time of cattle-raid)
while fighting with Karṇa 4. 49. 22; with
Kṛpa 4. 52. 3, 8; with Droṇa 4. 53. 28, 58;
at the start of the epic war Arjuna raised his
bow (Gāṇḍīva not named) while asking
Kṛṣṇa to station his chariot between the two
armies 6. 23. 20; out of dejection Gāṇḍīva
slipped down from Arjuna's hand 6. 23. 30;
but afterwards he used it successfully in the
war 6. 41. 1; he used it to attack Bhīṣma
6. 43. 9; 6. 81. 10; to fight with Suda-
kṣiṇa (a Kāmboja prince) 7. 67. 61; its use
against Jayadratha hinted 3. 252. 17, 18;
while forcing his way towards Jayadratha
1. 1. 137; Arjuna, with Gāṇḍīva in hand,
stood guard on the ground when, while mar-
ching towards Jayadratha, Kṛṣṇa refreshed
the horses 7. 74. 41; while aiming the arrow
at Jayadratha 7. 89. 17; to cut off Jaya-
dratha's head 7. 121. 3; while fighting with
Karṇa 7. 114. 82, 83, 87; 8. 68. 37; Arjuna
bent his bow (धनुर् विनाम्य) while
boasting about himself 8. 49. 92; he used it to
fight with Aśvatthāman 9. 13. 26; to protect
Yudhiṣṭhira 9. 17. 6; to foil the attempt of
Śakuni's warriors to kill Sahadeva 9. 28. 3,
30; while fighting with Vajradatta (son of
Bhagadatta of Prāgjyotiṣa) 14. 74. 4, 5, 14;
and when Vajradatta's elephant attacked
Arjuna 14. 75. 10; at the end of the epic
war when the Pāṇḍavas reached the camp of
Duryodhana Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to unstring
the Gāṇḍīva 9. 61. 9; he used it while
fighting with Babhruvāhana 14. 78. 27;
with Meghasandhi (son of Jarāsandha)
14. 83. 11, 15; with the Mleccha armies
of the Vaṅga, the Puṇḍra, and the Kerala
countries 14. 83. 29-30; to fight with the
Dasyus 16. 8. 52, 58.
H. Arjuna's
vow regarding Gāṇḍīva: It was Arjuna's
secret vow (उपांशुव्रत, व्रत) to kill a
person who asked him to give away his
Gāṇḍīva to some one else 8. 49. 9, 61-62;
(प्रतिज्ञा) 8. 49. 11, 63; but the vow was
apparently known to Kṛṣṇa (8. 49. 61) and
to Yudhiṣṭhira 8. 49. 107-109 (प्रतिज्ञा);
Yudhiṣṭhira, in a fit of anger, asked Arjuna
to give away Gāṇḍīva to Kṛṣṇa and act as
his charioteer, and hence Yudhiṣṭhira's life
was in danger 8. 48. 14; 8. 49. 1.
I. Com-
parisons: 1 (i) Arjuna with the stretched
Gāṇḍīva forming a full circle appeared like the
sun with a halo around it (यथैव सूर्यः
परिवेषगस् तथा) 8. 57. 57; (ii) when
Arjuna released arrows using both hands,
Gāṇḍīva looked like a swinging wheel of
fire (अग्निचक्रम् इवाबद्धम्) 4. 59. 12;
(iii) in the sacrifice to be performed with
weapons (शस्त्रयज्ञ), Gānḍīva would serve
as a sacrificial ladle (स्रुच्) 5. 139. 30;
2. Standard of comparison: (i) The
lustre of Rukmin's bow (Vijaya), obtained
from Mahendra, compared with that of
Gāṇḍīva 5. 155. 4; (ii) the sound (घोष)
of Abhimanyu's bow compared with that of
Gāṇḍīva 6. 45. 16
J. Defeat: 1. Occa-
sional: (i) When Arjuna's arrows had no
effect on the armour of Duryodhana, Kṛṣṇa
asked Arjuna whether his Gāṇḍīva had lost
its former force (प्राणाः) 7. 78. 7; (ii)
Jayadratha on one occasion succeeded in
piercing the Gāṇḍīva with three arrows
7. 121. 12; (iii) as long as Karṇa had his
armour, ear-rings, and the शक्ति, Arjuna, even
with his Gāṇḍīva, could not defeat Karṇa
7. 155. 17; 7. 155. 13-15; (iv) when
Aśvatthaman excelled Arjuna, Krṣṇa in
surprise asked him whether he still held the
Gāṇḍīva in his hand 8. 40. 124; (v) Gāṇ-
ḍīva dropped down from the hand of Arjuna
when Dhṛtavarman of the Trigartas hit
Arjuna on his hand with a sharp arrow
14. 73. 22-24 (picked up by Arjuna 14. 75.
24); (vi) when the Sindhu kings attacked
Arjuna and he swooned, Gāṇḍīva slipped
from his hand 14. 76. 21, (which he picked
up again 14. 76. 26); (vii) According to
Ulūka, Gāṇḍīva of no help to Arjuna at
the game of dice 5. 158. 28-29; 2. Final:
When Arjuna was taking with him the
Vṛṣṇi women to Hāstinapura, he was attacked
on way by the Dasyus; at that time Arjuna
could string the Gāṇḍīva with great effort
(यत्नाद् इव कथंचन; कृच्छ्रेण) 16.
8. 52-53; his arrows were exhausted so
that Arjuna had to strike the Dasyus with
the tip of the bow (धनुष्कोट्या) 16. 8.
58-60, 63 (धनुषश् चाविधेयत्वात्); 16.
9. 17-18; this was the defeat of Gāṇḍīva
(गाण्डीवस्य पराभवम्) 1. 2. 226.
K.
Returned to Varuṇa: When the Pāṇḍavas
started for the forest, Arjuna would not
leave his bow and quivers behind; Agni, who
had burnt the Khāṇḍava, asked Arjuna
to abandon the bow as it had no further
purpose to serve; Agni got it from Varuṇa
for Arjuna, hence Arjuna should return it
to Varuṇa; at the instance of his brothers,
Arjuna dropped the bow and the quivers into
the water 17. 1. 32, 36-37, 39-40.

गान्धर्व
Gāndharva1 adj.: Of a kind of missile
known to the Gandharvas.
Arjuna obtained the Gāndharva missile
from Tumburu and the other Gandharvas
by practising austerities; (Abhimanyu had

manyu deluded his opponents (तेनामोह-
यताहितान्) 7. 44. 21-24.

गान्धर्व

6. 19. 2; he arranged the Kaurava army
everyday in a different way, one of the ways
being the Gāndharva 6. 20. 18; Dhṛṣṭadyumna
also knew how to arrange the army in the
Gāndharva and the other ways 5. 56. 11.

गान्धर्व

ship of Lakṣmaṇa (son of Duryodhana) was
employed in it; they were comparable with
Indra, had golden banners with red flags,
dressed in red robes, and wearing red decora-
tions and gold strings; they had formed a cove-
nant (कृताभिसमयाः 7. 33. 13); they shared
their grief with each other, they were of equal
daring and they vied with each other (in
this regard), and were intent on each other's
well-being (अन्योन्यसमदुःखास् ते अन्यो-
न्यसमसाहसाः।अन्योन्यं स्पर्धमानाश्

other stood Śakuni, Śalya and Bhūriśravas
7. 33. 12-20.
C. Abhimanyu agreed to
penetrate the Cakravyūha: Penetrating
the व्यूह was a task difficult to be ac-
complished 7. 32. 19 (दुष्करं कर्म), a
burden difficult to bear (अविषह्यं गुरुं
भारम्) 7. 34. 12; its penetration (भेद)
not known to any one except Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna,
Pradyumna and Abhimanyu; even Abhi-
manyu was taught by Arjuna the way to
enter it, but not the way to get out of it
in case of emergency (नोत्सहे तु विनिर्-
गन्तुम् अहं कस्यांचिद् आपदि) 7. 34.
14-15, 19; 7. 50. 20-21; Abhimanyu commis-
sioned by Yudhiṣṭhira to penetrate the व्यूह
and the Pāṇḍavas assured him of support
from the rear 7. 34. 16-17; 20-23, 7. 32. 18;
(subsequently when Abhimanyu entered it
and was isolated from the other Pāṇḍavas

in the hearts of the enemies 7. 63. 31-33;
called महाव्यूह (7. 63. 24); it was
twelve गव्यूतिस् long and five गव्यूतिस्
wide in the rear half (7. 63. 21).
B.
Arrangement: In the interior of the rear
half, a section of the army was arranged to
form Padmavyūha which was difficult to
penetrate (पश्चार्धे तस्य पद्मस् तु गर्-
भव्यूहः सुदुर्भिदः 7. 63. 23; 7. 53.
27; concealed (गूढः) within the Padma-
vyūha there was yet another व्यूह known
as Sūcī 7. 63. 23; at the entrance (मुख)
of the main Cakraśakaṭavyūha stood Droṇa
himself with the king of the Bhojas to offer
protection to him 7. 63. 28-29; in the front
of all the army divisions (अग्रटः सर्वसैन्-
यानाम् 7. 63. 19) stood Durmarṣaṇa, the

ready Kṛtavarman, followed by the Kām-
bhoja king and king Jalasandha; they were
supported by Duryodhana and his ministers
(सहामात्यः 7. 63. 25); behind them all
were stationed, to protect the Sūcivyūha,
hundreds and thousands of warriors who
would never turn back while fighting
(योधानाम् अनिवर्तिनाम् 7. 63. 26); behind
them, at the position of the ‘eye of the
needle’ (सूचिपाशे) of the Sūcīvyūha stood
Jayadratha surrounded by a large force 7.
63. 27; 7. 53. 27; he was guarded by six
principal warriors, Saumadatti (Bhūriśravas),
Karṇa, Aśvatthāman, Śalya, Vṛṣasena, Kṛpa,
with a force consisting of a hundred thou-
sand horsemen, six अयुतस् of chariot-
fighters, fourteen thousand elephant-riders,

place where Jayadratha was stationed was at
a distance of three गव्यूतिस् from the main
battle front where Droṇa stood guard 7. 63.
11-14; 7. 53. 26, 28.

B. Uses:
(1) According to Bhīṣma, only Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa, and no one else, knew the missile of
Tvaṣṭṛ and other heavenly missiles 6. 116.
38-39; when employed by Arjuna against the
Saṃśaptakas it created thousands of forms
so that some of the warriors on the enemy's
side looked like Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa; deceived
by this delusion, the enemies killed warriors of
their own side mistaking them to be Arjuna
and Kṛṣṇa; it also destroyed thousands of
arrows released by the enemies and killed
them 7. 18. 11-15; (2) However, Bhīma
himself, like Tvaṣṭṛ, employed this weapon
against the demon Alambusa to release thou-
sands of arrows to rout the Kaurava army;
it destroyed Alambusa's powerful माया
(महामाया) and tormented him 7. 83.

the creator of the Brahmadaṇḍa (ब्रह्म-
दण्डविनिर्माता) 13. 17. 130.
B. Asso-
ciations: (1) It was looked upon as a weapon
specially of Yama (cf. the expression Yama-
daṇḍa in section C below); hence Yama called
‘holding दण्ड in hand’ (दण्डपाणि) 3.
12. 46; 3. 42. 10; (दण्डहस्त) 8. 29. 28
(Vaivasvata); (दण्डधार) 3. 40. 38; or
‘equipped with Daṇḍa’ (दण्डिन्) 1. 180.
16; it was Yama who gave his irresistible
(अप्रतिवारण) Daṇḍa to Arjuna with proper
rites (विधिवत्), together with the मन्त्रस्
(समन्त्रम्), and instruction regarding its
full operation (सोपचारम् = सेतिकर्तव्यता-
कम् according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 41.
26), its release (समोक्षम्), and withdrawal
(सनिवर्तनम्); Arjuna was supposed to
perform great deeds with it 3. 42. 23-24; 3.
89. 12; 4. 56. 14; 7. 53. 43; 12. 5. 13; Yama

Khāṇḍava fire 1. 218. 31, 37; some people
afraid to commit sins due to their fear of
Yama's Daṇḍa 12. 15. 5; (a king punish-
ing the unrighteous with दण्ड (punish-
ment) acts like Yama 12. 68. 45); (2)
of Antaka (cf. the expression Antaka-
daṇḍa in section C below); hence Antaka
called दण्डपाणि 4. 22. 19; 5. 50. 7;
6. 50. 2; 6. 58. 51; 6. 59. 11; 6. 78. 57; 6.

Brahman (cf. the expression Brahmadaṇḍa in
section C below); angry Sudhanvan compar-
ed with the burning Brahmadaṇḍa 2. 61. 62;
Vāsuki, afraid of his mother's curse, confused
the directions as though he was tormented
by Brahmadaṇḍa 1. 49. 22; Āstīka would
destroy the Brahmadaṇḍa (महाघोर) of
which Vāsuki was so much afraid 1. 49. 24;
serpents, struck by Brahmadaṇḍa, fell into
the snake sacrifice of Janamejaya 1. 52. 22;
Brahmadaṇḍa mentioned among the missiles
which should be known to a king 2. 5. 111;
Brahmadaṇḍa and other missiles moved
around the chariot of Śiva (परिस्कन्दाः)
to guard it in all directions 8. 24. 79; (6)
of Rudra: Rudradaṇḍa among those missiles
which moved round the chariot of Śiva
(परिस्कन्दाः) to guard it in all directions

a stick used as a powerful weapon, compar-
ed with the दण्ड (Yamadaṇḍa, Antakadaṇḍa,
Mṛtyudaṇḍa, Kāladaṇḍa or Brahmadaṇḍa):

with his conch, disk, mace etc.) when he
laughed to show his terrible form to Duryo-
dhana and others in the Sabhā of the

after the death of his father Droṇa, to kill
the Pāṇḍavas 1. 1. 145; 1. 2. 165; 7. 166. 55;
a sub-पर्वन् related to the employment of
the Nārāyaṇāstra occurs after the sub-पर्वन्
related to द्रोणवध 1. 2. 58.
A. History: Droṇa received the Nārā-
yaṇāstra as a boon from Nārāyaṇa himself
who appeared before him in the form of
a Brāhmaṇa 7. 166. 43-44, 51; with its
acquisition Droṇa became unrivalled in
battle 7. 166. 45; given by Nārāyaṇa
also to Aśvatthāman 7. 166. 50; Aśva-
tthāman knew how to release it (सकल्यम्
for सकल्पम् ? See Cr. Notes 7, p. 1157
on 166. 42; Nī. कल्यः प्रयोगः on Bom.
Ed. 7. 195. 30), and how to withdraw it
(सनिवर्तनम्) 7. 166. 42 (but See Section
C. 3 below); Nārāyaṇāstra known only to
Droṇa and Aśvatthāman; it was not known
even to Arjuna and the other Pāṇḍavas, nor
to Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki, Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Śikhaṇḍin 7. 166. 2. 41-42.
B. Descrip-
tion: heavenly (दिव्य) 1. 1. 145; 7. 166.
60; great missile (महास्त्र) 7. 166. 49;
(परम) 7. 166. 44; fierce, frightful (उग्र)
1. 2. 165; (घोररूपं भयावहम्) 7. 167.
6.
C. Use: (1) To be used with great
circumspection: The missile was not to be
employed in haste (न त्व् इदं सहसा
ब्रह्मन् प्रयोक्तव्यं कथंचन); since
it did not return without killing the enemy,
it might kill, if used without circumspection,
even one who did not deserve to be killed
7. 166. 46-47; (2) Mode of release: To use
it, Aśvatthāman touched water and produced
the divine missile (तथोक्त्वा द्रोणपुत्रो ऽपि
तदोपस्पृश्य भारत।प्रादुश्चकार तद्
दिव्यम् अस्त्रं नारायणं तदा) 7. 166. 60;
(3) Restrictions: It could be used only
once, and it could not be withdrawn; hence
Aśvatthāman unable to employ it again when
requested by Duryodhana to do so; if with-
drawn the अस्त्र would kill the user 7. 171.
24, 27, 28, 30.
D. Effects: When em-
ployed, the missile released powerful arrows
(? कृशाश्वतनयाः), as also sharp arrows
which would fill the directions 7. 166. 38;
it let loose many heavenly weapons (दिव्यानि
शस्त्रवर्षाणि) and the employer (Aśvat-
thāman) shone with lustre 7. 166. 50; the
arrows released from it would hit the enemies
as desired by the employer (Aśvatthāman);
it would release rocks at will and iron-tipped
arrows which would put the enemy to flight
7. 166. 53-54; when Aśvatthāman produced
the missile, thunderous winds carrying water-
drops blew in cloud-less sky, the earth shook,
and the ocean was agitated; rivers started
flowing in the opposite direction; peaks of
mountains were shattered; sun became turbid
(कलुष), and the gods, the demons, and
the Gandharvas were frightened 7. 167. 1-5;
arrows with shining tips appeared in thou-
sands to cover the army of the enemy and
fill the directions; (hot) iron balls (कार्ष्णाय-
समया गुडाः) shining like celestial bodies,
शतघ्नीस् (‘hundred-killers’), fire-arms
(? हुताशदाः), and disks with sharp ends
(चक्राणि क्षुरान्तानि), all these were produc-
ed by the Nārāyaṇāstra (7. 170. 16-19); as the
Pāṇḍava warriors tried to resist the missile,
it grew in strength 7. 170. 21; as a result,
the Pāṇḍava army was burnt and destroyed
7. 170. 22-23; to combat it successfully
Kṛṣṇa advised the warriors to lay down arms
and get down from their chariots and mounts
7. 170. 38-42; when all followed his in-
struction, Bhīma wanted to resist the missile
with arrows, mace, and the strength of his
arms; as a consequence, the Nārāyaṇāstra
grew in strength; since other warriors
had laid down their arms the missile des-
cended on Bhīma with all its strength 7.
170. 45-46, 50-51, 57-60; seeing Bhīma
surrounded by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Arjuna tried
to protect him from the missile by using
Vāruṇāstra; since this was of no avail,
Arjuna and Vāsudeva left from their chariot,
ran to Bhīma, and entered through the cover
of lustre produced by the अस्त्र; since they
had no weapons, the अस्त्र did not affect them
(and also because of the effect of the Vāru-
ṇāstra and the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna);
Bhīma was forced down by Nara (Arjuna)
and Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) from his chariot and
forced to give up weapons; the Nārāyaṇāstra
was then pacified; the quarters became clear
and gentle winds blew; the birds and the
animals felt assured 7. 171. 1, 3, 6, 10-14,
20-22; if Vāsudeva had not shown the way
to combat the Nārāyaṇāstra it would have
meant death for the enemy (of the Kauravas)
7. 171. 28; but the missile was rendered in-
effective and the Pāṇḍavas freed from it 7.
171. 33; 8. 1. 42.
E. The means to pacify
the Nārāyaṇāstra: When released, the missile
must kill the enemy and only then it would
subside; the other ways of pacifying it were to
run away from it, to lay down the arms, to
beg for life, and ask refuge (वधः संख्ये
द्रवश् चैव शस्त्राणां च विसर्जनम्।
प्रयाचनं च शत्रूणां गमनं शर-
णस्य च॥एते प्रशमने योगा महास्त्रस्य
परन्तप) 7. 166. 48-49.

the Nārāyaṇāstra 13. 14. 127.

a burning flame of fire (दीप्तवह्निशिखो-
पम 13. 14. 139); since it belongs to
Śiva, it is circled by the neck of the ser-
pent (सर्पकण्ठाग्रवेष्टित) 13. 14. 139;
it was given by Śiva to Rāma Jāmadagnya
when he was satisfied with Rāma 13. 14.
137; Rāma used it to cut off the head of

(शस्त्र) to kill the sons of Kārtavīrya and
the Kṣatriyas who were his followers 3. 117.

including the पाताल, the heaven, and the guar-
dians of the quarters, to tremble 7. 51. 42;
Kṛṣṇa blew it forcefully to produce a shrill
note (पाञ्चजन्यं च बलवद् दध्मौ
तारेण केशवः) 7. 78. 37; the sound excelled
all other sounds and filled the heaven and
the earth 7. 79. 13; 7. 102. 59; 8. 37. 19; 8.
68. 57; it reverberated in forests, mountains,
rivers and directions 8. 68. 57; 6. 55. 102; it
produced sound like the one heard at the flash
of a lightning 5. 149. 65.
E. Effect of the
sound: The sound caused delight to warriors
on Kṛṣṇa's side 5. 149. 65; 6. 1. 17; but the
enemies felt dejected (5. 47. 59; 8. 37. 20),
and trembled; they lost courage, and the
draught-animals passed urine and dung 7.
64. 21-24; 6. 1. 18; 6. 67. 2; 7. 3. 19; 8.
68. 55; 9. 3. 19; hearing it enemies, strong
and weak, fell on the ground 7. 78. 38.
F. Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) when
the Pāṇḍava warriors reached Kurukṣetra
they blew their respective conches and so did
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna 5. 149. 64-65; (ii) when
the two armies were arrayed against each
other, ready to fight, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna blew
their conches 6. 1. 17; 6. 23. 15; (iii) Kṛṣṇa
blew his Pāñcajanya at the start of the
second day's war 6. 47. 25 (and presumably
at the start of the war on all subsequent
days); (iv) when Arjuna vowed to fight
more seriously with Bhīṣma 6. 55. 102;
(v) when Arjuna rushed at Bhīṣma who was
fighting with other Pāṇḍavas 6. 67. 2;
(vi) Kṛṣṇa blew his conch when Arjuna
took the vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 51. 41;
(vii) at the start of the day on which Jaya-
dratha was killed 7. 64. 20; when Arjuna was
heading forward looking for Jayadratha in
the Kaurava army 7. 75. 31; as Arjuna was
nearing Jayadratha 7. 78. 37; 7. 79. 11; at
the end of the day when Jayadratha was killed
7. 123. 41; [It is significant that the sounding
of Pāñcajanya is mentioned on many occa-
sions on the day on which Arjuna had to
fulfil his difficult vow to kill Jayadratha];
(viii) Kṛṣṇa blew it when Arjuna got rid
of the Saṃśaptakas who had overwhelmed
both of them 8. 37. 19, 15-17; (ix) at the
death of Karṇa and the subsequent rout of
the Kaurava army 8. 68. 57; (x) at the fall
of Duryodhana 9. 60. 65; (2) Outside the
epic war: Kṛṣṇa blew it to challenge Śālva
when he reached Śālva's Saubhapura 3. 15.
20; when Kṛṣṇa started fighting with Śālva
3. 21. 12; when, during his fight with Śālva,
Kṛṣṇa killed many Dānavas 3. 21. 29-30;
G. Its use as a signal: (1) Kṛṣṇa had told
Dāruka, his charioteer, that when he heard
the sound of Pāñcajanya he was to rush to
the battle-field driving Kṛṣṇa's chariot for its
eventual use by Kṛṣṇa to enable Arjuna to
fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 56. 36;
(2) The sound was once interpreted by
Droṇa to mean that Arjuna wanted to set
aside other heroes and attack Bhīṣma 6. 108.
14; (3) It was once interpreted by
Yudhiṣṭhira to mean that Arjuna was in
danger 7. 85. 35; on another occasion, the
sound meant for Yudhiṣṭhira the death of
Arjuna, and hence Kṛṣṇa's starting to fight
7. 102. 32-33.
H. End: When the time
of the destruction of the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas arrived the blowing of Pāñca-
janya in their houses was accompanied by
the harsh braying of the asses 16. 3. 15
[नदन्तं पाञ्चजन्यं च वृष्ण्यन्धक-
निवेशने।समन्तात् प्रत्यवाश्यन्त रासभा
दारुणस्वराः॥ Does Pāñcajanya here refer
not to Kṛṣṇa's special conch, but to the conches
in general in the houses of the Vṛṣṇis and
the Andhakas ?].

पारमेष्ठ्य
Pārameṣṭhya (astra) nt.: Name of a
missile of Prajāpati.
According to Bhīṣma it was known to
Arjuna and perhaps to Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 38-39.
[See Brahmāstra]

पार्जन्य
Pārjanya (astra) nt.: Name of a
missile 1. 125. 19 [See Parjanyāstra]

पाश
Pāśa m. (pl.): Noose used as a missile
(पाश generally used in pl., but also rarely
in sg. 1. 218. 31).
A. Association with Varuṇa: Listed as
a missile of Ambupa (Varuṇa) 8. 66. 15;
hence called वारुण अस्त्र 4. 56. 14; Varuṇa
has epithets like पाशभृत् 6. 46. 7; 6. 103.
17; पाशवन्त् 7. 64. 15; पाशिन् 8. 29. 28.
B. Description: Described as heavenly
(दिव्य) 3. 42. 31; 3. 89. 12; 12. 5. 13-14;
fierce (घोर) 3. 190. 60; 7. 53. 43; irresi-
stible (अनिवारण) 3. 42. 27.
C. Use
made by Varuṇa: (1) In battles: Varuṇa
bound thousands of Daityas with them in the
fight with Tārakāsura 3. 42. 28; during
Varuṇa's fight with the demons, Bali, son of
Virocana, was bound by the पाशस् 12. 220.
18; Bali would be free from these पाशस् at
the turn of time (मोक्षयन्ते वारुणाः
पाशास् तवेमे कालपर्ययात्) 12. 220. 110;
at a time only one पाश of Bali will be
released (एकैकस् ते तदा पाशः क्रमशः
प्रतिमोक्ष्यते) 12. 220. 114; Varuṇa equi-
pped himself with पाश (sg.) when he got
ready to help Indra in his fight with Kṛṣṇa
and Arjuna at the Khāṇḍava forest 1. 218. 31;
(2) To punish the sinners: Varuṇa has
one thousand पाशस् with which he binds a
liar; when the liar is to be released he is
freed of one पाश at the end of each year 2.
61. 67-68; sinners in general bound by the
पाशस् of Varuṇa 12. 96. 20; 3. 190. 60; one
who does not give what he has promised to
give, or one who takes back what has been
given, is bound by the पाशस् of Varuṇa 13.
61. 72; every one is afraid at the sight of
Varuṇa's पाशस् 12. 220. 89; Varuṇa binding
with पाशस् referred to as संयम (?)
(वारुणे चैव संयमे) 2. 69. 16 (Nī.
संयमे वशीकरणे on Bom. Ed. 2. 78. 19].
D. Pāśas obtained by Arjuna: Arjuna
received from Varuṇa the पाशस् along with
the secret of withdrawing them (प्रतिगृह्-
णीष्व कौन्तेय सरहस्यनिवर्तनान्); if
Arjuna used them on his stretched bow, even
Antaka could not get rid of them; with their
use Arjuna could destroy every Kṣatriya on
the earth 3. 42. 27, 29, 30; Arjuna's receiv-
ing the अस्त्र of Varuṇa, without naming it,
referred to 3. 89. 12; 3. 164. 29; 4. 56. 14;
7. 53. 43; 12. 5. 13-14. [See Vāruṇa1,
Vāruṇa2]

पाशुपत

missile of Śiva 7. 57. 16.
A. Description: Heavenly (दिव्य) 3.

14. 124; large, of huge shape (महत्) 3.
41. 13; 13. 14. 124; (महाकाय) 13. 14. 125;

(सस्फुलिङ्गं … विसृजन्तम् (mas.) इवान-
लम्) 13. 14. 125; (उद्गिरन्तम् (mas.)
इवानलम्) 13. 14. 126; itself irresistible
(अप्रतिहत) 3. 163. 51; (दूरासद) 3. 163.
52, but resisting all other missiles (सर्वा-
स्त्रप्रतिषेधन) 3. 163. 51; (सर्वशस्त्र-
विघातन) 13. 14. 127; unsurpassed, in-
describable (अद्वितीयम् अनिर्देश्यम्) 13. 14.
125; frightful to all beings (सर्वभूत-
भयावह) 13. 14. 125; difficult to be
endured even by gods, Dānavas, and Rākṣasas
(दुष्प्रसहं सुरदानवराक्षसैः) 3. 163.
52; destroying the enemies and their armies
(उत्सादनम् अमित्राणां परसेनानिकर्त-
नम्) 3. 163. 52; capable of destroying the
three worlds (त्रैलोक्यसंहारकर) 8. 57.
44; described as having a terrible bodily form
—having one foot, large teeth, a thousand
heads and bellies, and a thousand arms,
tongues, and eyes—(एकपादं महादं-
ष्ट्रं सहस्रशिरसोदरम्।सहस्रभुज-
जिह्वाक्षम्) 13. 14. 126.
B. Use by Śiva:
(1) Śiva killed with it all Daityas in the battle
7. 57. 16; (all the enemies of gods) 7. 57. 65;
(2) Śiva charged his arrow with the Pāśupata
missile and shot it to burn the त्रिपुरस् of the
three sons of Tāraka Asura 8. 24. 115, 120;
(8. 24. 4, 10-12); 13. 14. 128.
C. Śiva
gave it to (1) Arjuna: Two accounts:
(i) Arjuna desired to have Śiva's Pāśupata
missile so that he could burn the Dānavas,
the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the
Gandharvas and the mythical serpents
(पन्नगस्) in battle; he could then be a
match for Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, and Karṇa
3. 41. 7, 9, 11; Arjuna called it Brahma-
śiras which was terrific and of fierce power
(यत् तद् ब्रह्मशिरो नाम रौद्रं भीम-
पराक्रमम्) 3. 41. 8; Śiva ready to give
Pāśupata, his dear weapon (दयितम् अस्त्रम्),
to Arjuna as he was capable of possessing
(धारण), releasing (मोक्ष), and with-
drawing (संहार) it 3. 41. 13; to receive
it, Arjuna purified himself and remained fully
attentive (शुचिर् भूत्वा समाहितः); he
folded his hands and said to Śiva ‘recite (the
mantra)’ (अधीष्व); Śiva then taught it
to Arjuna together with its secrets and mode
of withdrawal (सरहस्यनिवर्तनम्) 3. 41.
17-18; the missile, like the God of Death in
bodily form, then waited on Arjuna; at that
time the earth trembled and there was a loud
sound of conches, drums and भेरिस् by thou-
sands; the gods and demons saw the missile
in bodily form standing near Arjuna 3. 41.
17-22; 1. 1. 109; 3. 163. 48, 51; 6. 116. 38;
8. 57. 44; (ii) During the night, after Arjuna
took the vow to kill Jayadratha the next
day before sunset, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to
acquire the knowledge of the great Pāśupata
missile from Śiva in order to be able to
accomplish his vow; Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna
to mentally approach god Śiva; Arjuna
touched water (संस्पृश्याम्भः), sat down
on the ground, and mentally went to Bhava
(Śiva) 7. 57. 17-19; Arjuna praised Śiva and
made him favourable to give the missile 7.
57. 59; Śiva told Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa that
nearby there was a lake of nectar where he
had left his divine bow and arrow; he asked
them to get his bow and arrow 7. 57. 64-
65; when they brought the bow and arrow,
a Brahmacārin came from the side of Śiva; he
held the bow and, putting the arrow on it,
drew it according the prescriptions (व्यकर्षच्
चापि विधिवत् सशरं धनुर् उत्तमम् 7.
57. 75); having seen how the Brahmacārin
held the bow in his grip, how he drew the
string, and the posture adopted by him
(तस्य मौर्वीं च मुष्टिं च स्थानं
चालक्ष्य पाण्डवः 7. 57. 76), and having
heard the मन्त्र recited by Śiva, Arjuna
understood the way how to employ Pāśupata;
the arrow was shot by the Brahmacārin in
the lake and the bow was again placed in
it; Arjuna then remembered the boon Śiva
granted to him during his stay in the forest
(आरण्यक) and his meeting Śiva, and wished
that he might now receive the boon; knowing
Ariuna's mind, Śiva gave him the boon, the
Pāśupata missile, and wished him success in
accomplishing his vow; Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
bowed down to Śiva and, when permitted to
leave, delighted they returned to their camp,
7. 57. 73-81; (Śiva gave missile to Arjuna
7. 173. 100); (2) Besides Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
knew the use of Pāśupata 7. 57. 79; 8.
57. 44; Bhīṣma is not so sure about Kṛṣṇa's
knowledge of the Pāśupata 6. 116. 39.
D. Effects: The missile, when released,
produced thousands of tridents (शूलस्),
fierce maces (गदाश् चोग्रप्रदर्शनाः),
and charmed arrows having the form of
serpents (शराश् चाशीविषाकाराः संभवन्त्य्
अनुमन्त्रिताः) 3. 41. 10.
E. Restrictions
on its use: Arjuna was specifically told by
Śiva that the missile was never to be used
against men (न प्रयोज्यं भवेद् एतन्
मानुषेषु कथंचन); Arjuna was to
use the missile only if he was under
severe pressure (पीड्यमानेन बलवत्),
or if he wished to ward off the missiles
used by his opponents (अस्त्राणां प्रति-
घाते च सर्वथैव प्रयोजयेः) 3. 163.
49-50; 3. 41. 15; if used against ordinary
persons it would burn the entire world
3. 41. 15.
F. Use in the epic war:
(1) Arjuna in his message to the Kauravas,
sent through Saṃjaya, threatened that he
would use the Pāśupata missile against them in
the war 5. 47. 100; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that in
the ‘sacrifice to be performed with the wea-
pons’ (शस्त्रयज्ञ 5. 139. 29), the मन्त्रस्
recited by Arjuna while releasing the Pāśupata
and other missiles would serve as the मन्त्रस्
used while performing a sacrifice 5. 139. 31;
(2) Droṇa used Pāśupata against Arjuna
and it was repelled (जघान) by Arjuna
presumably by using the same missile 7.
163. 28; (3) Karṇa used it against Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and hence Kṛṣṇa apprehended Yudhi-
ṣṭhira's death in the war 8. 43. 21, 18.
G. Status: The Pāśupata missile surpassed
all other missiles like Brāhma, Nārāyaṇa,
Aindra, Āgneya, and Vāruṇa; it could
destroy all weapons (सर्वशस्त्रविघातन)
13. 14. 127; even gods like Indra, Yama,
Kubera, Varuṇa, and Vāyu did not know it
3. 41. 14; there was none who could not be
killed by it; besides its use on an arrow,
it could be released even by mind, eye, and
speech (मनसा चक्षुषा वाचा धनुषा च
निपात्यते) 3. 41. 16.

पिनाक
Pināka1 nt.: Name of the bow of Śiva
(of Rudra, who killed cattle with it 6. 58.
58; 6. 59. 16; 10. 3. 29).
A. Association with Śiva: Śiva told
Umā that he held Pināka to accomplish the
objectives of the gods 13. 127. 48; 13. 128.
7; Upamanyu saw Śiva with his Pināka bow
13. 14. 122; considered as a special weapon
of Hara (Śiva) 8. 66. 15; hence Śiva is
called पिनाकिन् 1. 28. 20; 3. 39. 25; 3. 40. 31;
3. 42. 1, 3; 3. 104. 11; 3. 221. 18; 5. 168. 5;
6. 58. 52; 7. 69. 56; 7. 172. 59; 7. 173. 33;
8. 49. 93; 9. 43. 33; 12. 149. 110; 12. 278. 27;
13. 15. 11; पिनाकधृक् 3. 40. 27; 3. 93. 12;
3. 163. 5, 42; 4. 21. 59; 6. 58. 52; 7. 172.
73; 7. 173. 99; 12. 274. 31, 48; 13. 17. 72,
133; 13. 127. 50; 13. 132. 27; 13. 145. 10;
14. 77. 44; पिनाकपाणि 3. 40. 1; 8. 24. 102;
10. 3. 29 (Rudra); 13. 14. 151; 13. 128. 20;
पिनाकहस्त 12. 320. 31.
B. Origin: Śiva
wanted to tame sage Uśanas, a Bhārgava-
relative (भार्गवदायादो मुनिः 12. 278. 7)
because Uśanas had taken away the riches
of Kubera; so Śiva, with शूल in hand, went
to Uśanas; Uśanas using his Yogic powers
appeared on the tip of the शूल; Śiva then
bent the शूल to get Uśanas into his hand; the
शूल, bent by the hand (पाणि), was called by
Śiva ‘पिनाक’ (आनतेनाथ शूलेन पाणिना-
मिततेजसा।पिनाकम् इति चोवाच शूलम्
उग्रायुधः प्रभुः 12. 278. 18-19; Nīla.
uses this description to suggest a fanciful
etymology of पिनाक: शूलम् एव पिनाक-
पदेन उवाच।यतः पाणिना अनामयत्
अतः पिनाकम्।तेन आद्यपदस्याद्यन्त-
वर्णाभ्यां द्वितीयस्य मध्यमाभ्यां
कप्रत्यययुक्ताभ्यां पिनाकपदम् निष्प-
न्नम् इति योगप्रदर्शनं कृतम् Bom. Ed.
12. 289. 18).
C. Description: Illustrious
(श्रीमत्) 3. 40. 3 (not named); its splendour
like that of a thousand lightnings (इन्द्रा-
युधसहस्राभ 13. 14. 122).
D. Com-
parisons: (1) Bhīma's गदा compared with
Pināka (of Rudra) 6. 58. 58; 6. 59. 16;
or Bhīma with his गदा compared with
Pinākin (Śiva) holding his Pināka 6. 58.
52; (2) Arjuna's Añjalika arrow with which
he killed Karṇa compared with Pināka (i. e.
the arrow shot from Pināka) 8. 67. 18;
(3) The arrow of Karṇa with which he
removed the किरीट of Arjuna supposed to
have achieved something not possible for
Hara's (Śiva's) Pināka (i. e. for the arrow
shot from Pināka) 8. 66. 15. [See Pināka2]

पिनाक
Pināka2 m. (pl.): A kind of weapon
(a शूल with a bend and hence looking like
the staff of a strung bow ?)
Ghaṭotkaca and Alāyudha fought each
other using various weapons including Pinākas
(ततो नानाप्रहरणैर् अन्योन्यम् अभिवर्ष-
ताम्।आयसैः परिघैः … पिनाकैः … )
7. 153. 21-22; the Rākṣasas of Ghaṭotkaca
struck down the Kaurava warriors with
various weapons including Pinākas ( …
वज्रैः पिनाकैर् अशनिप्रहारैः) 7. 154.
36. [See Pināka1]

पैतामह
Paitāmaha adj.: of the missile of
Pitāmaha.
Arjuna was to learn it along with the
other divine missiles at the residence of Indra
in the heaven 3. 164. 30. [See Brahmāstra]

पैशाच
Paiśāca adj. (pl.): of व्यूह (arrange-
ment of the army) known to the Piśācas.
Every day Bhīṣma arranged the army
of the Kauravas in different व्यूहस्, some of
those being the Paiśācas (दिवसे दिवसे
प्राप्ते भीष्मः शान्तनवो युधि।आसुरान्
अकरोद् व्यूहान् पैशाचान् अथ राक्षसान्)
6. 104. 16.

पौण्ड्र
Pauṇḍra m.: Name of the conch of
Bhīmasena.
Large in size (महाशङ्ख), Bhīma
blew it at the start of the battle on the first
day 6. 23. 15; he blew it on the second day
6. 47. 25; (and presumably on every subse-
quent day, as also on many other occasions
during the war although not specifically
named each time).

पौरन्दर
Paurandara adj.: of the missile of
Purandara (Indra).
Arjuna told Karṇa that he was well-
versed in the use of this missile due to his
teacher's instruction (निष्ठितो गुरुशासनात्)
1. 181. 20.

प्रज्ञास्त्र
Prajñāstra nt.: Name of a missile.
Droṇa used Prajñāstra to bring the sons
of Dhṛtarāṣṭra back to consciousness (अथ
प्रत्यागतप्राणास् तव पुत्रा महारथाः 6.
73. 50), who had become unconscious due
to the Pramohanāstra of Dhṛṣṭadyumna 6.
73. 42-43, 47, 49; Vibhīṣaṇa brought Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa to consciousness (बोधयाम्
आस तौ वीरौ; प्रबोधितौ; तौ लब्ध-
संज्ञौ) who were bound by the arrows
of Indrajit and who had apparently lost
consciousness 3. 273. 5, 7; (both Droṇa
and Vibhīṣaṇa recited only the मन्त्रस्
of Prajñāstra without using them on the
arrow ?).

प्रमोहनास्त्र
Pramohanāstra, Mohanāstra nt.:
Name of a missile.
Used by Dhṛṣṭadyumna to kill (जिघां-
सुः) the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra who showered
arrows on him; Dhṛṣṭadyumna employed
Pramohanāstra on them due to which they
lost consciousness 6. 73. 42, 43, 47; Droṇa
removed the effect of the missile (Moha-
nāstra) by using Prajñāstra 6. 73. 49.

प्रसृत
Prasṛta nt.: One of the twenty-one
movements (सो ऽचरद् विविधान् मार्गान्
प्रकारान् एकविंशतिम्) used while fighting
with a sword and a shield.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna used it when he, with a
sword and a shield in his hand, wanted to
attack Droṇa who shot arrows at him 7.
164. 145-148.

प्रस्वाप
Prasvāpa nt.: Name of a missile which
sent the adversary to sleep.
It was fashioned by Viśvakarman
(विश्वकृतम्) and it belonged properly to
Prajāpati (प्राजापत्यम्) 5. 184. 12; des-
cribed as ‘dear’ (सुदयित, दयित) 5. 184.
11; 5. 184. 15; 5. 185. 23; it was known
to Bhīṣma in his former life (पूर्वस्मिन्
देहधारणे); in his long-drawn fight with
Rāma Jāmadagnya, when Bhīṣma was deject-
ed, the eight Vipras (Vasus) reminded him
of this missile in a dream and told him
that it would flash upon him again (इदम्
अस्त्रम् सुदयितम् प्रत्यभिज्ञास्यते भ-
वान्); the missile was not known to Rāma
Jāmadagnya, and to no one else on the
earth; the Vipras advised Bhīṣma to employ
it forcefully (भृशं संयोजयस्व 5. 184.
13) against Rāma Jāmadagnya; as a result
Rāma would not die but just go to sleep;
in its use against his teacher Rāma, Bhīṣma
would incur no sin; Bhīṣma will have
thus defeated Rāma with Prasvāpāstra (to
be awakened by him later by using Saṃbo-
dhanāstra); since Rāma could not be killed
in battle, he was to be defeated by using
Prasvāpāstra; the Vipras told Bhīṣma that
a hero sent to sleep in battle and the
one killed were considered by them equal
(प्रसुप्तं वा मृतं वापि तुल्यं मन्या-
महे वयम् 5. 184. 16) 5. 184. 9-17; the
next day when Bhīṣma thought of the missile
for employing it, it flashed in his mind
(चिन्तितं च तद् अस्त्रं मे मनसि प्रत्य-
भात् तदा) 5. 185. 22-23; the gods, appear-
ing in the heaven, however, forbade Bhīṣma
from using Prasvāpa against Rāma; as
Bhīṣma put the arrow on his bow, Nārada
drew Bhīṣma's attention to what the gods
asked him and he told Bhīṣma not to insult
Rāma who was his teacher; the eight Vipras
also asked Bhīṣma to do what Nārada told
him, since therein lay the welfare of the worlds
(एतद् धि परमं श्रेयो लोकानाम्); hence
Bhīṣma withdrew the missile; when Rāma
saw Bhīṣma withdrawing the missile he
accepted defeat at the hands of Bhīṣma
(दृष्ट्वा तद् अस्त्रं विनिवर्तितं वै।जितो
ऽस्मि भीष्मेण सुमन्दबुद्धिर् इत्य् एव
वाक्यं सहसा व्यमुञ्चत्) 5. 186. 1-8.
[See Prājāpatya1 from which Prasvāpa is
different]

प्राजापत्य
prājāpatya1 nt.: A missile of Prajāpati.
(1) It was used by Bhīṣma and Arjuna
against each other during the cattle-raid
4. 59. 21; (2) Employed by Droṇa, along
with Aindra, against Yudhiṣṭhira to kill him
(जिघांसुः); both missiles were repelled by
Yudhiṣṭhira with Māhendrāstra 7. 132. 31-32.
[See Prasvāpa which, although प्राजापत्य,
is different from this missile].

प्राजापत्य
Prājāpatya2 adj.: of the missile Pras-
vāpa belonging to Prajāpati 5. 184. 12.
[Different from Prājāpatya missile. See
Prasvāpa and Prājāpatya1]

बार्हस्पत्य
Bārhaspatya m.: A particular arrange-
ment of the army (व्यूह) originating with
Bṛhaspati.
Described as chief of the व्यूहस्
(व्यूहराज) 8. 31. 25, great व्यूह (महा-
व्यूह) that caused fear to the enemies
8. 31. 26, 29; it consisted of ‘wings’
(पक्ष) and ‘extensions or extremities of
wings’ (प्रपक्ष) 8. 31. 6, 29; it was
used by Karṇa on the seventeenth day of
the war to attack the Parānīkabhid Vyūha
of the Pāṇḍavas 8. 31. 5, 1; its ‘right wing’
(दक्षिण पक्ष) was constituted by Kṛpa, the
Magadha warriors (मगधश् च (?) 8. 31.
11, v. l. मागधास् च), and Kṛtavarman;
the wing was further extended (प्रपक्ष)
by stationing there Śakuni and Ulūka, who
were guarded by horsemen from Gandhāra
country (सादिभिः … गान्धारिभिः 8. 31. 12-
13) and invincible warriors from highlands
(पार्वतीयैश् च दुर्जयैः 8. 31. 13); on the
‘left side’ (वाम पार्श्व) stood the Saṃ-
śaptakas with thirty-four thousand chariot-
fighters, who would not leave the battle,
together with the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra; the
left wing was further extended (प्रपक्ष)
by ordering the Kāmbojas, the Śakas and
the Yavanas to be there; they were there
with chariots and horse-men, and foot-soldiers;
in the middle of the front of the army stood
Karṇa himself to guard it; he was offered
protection by his sons; he looked suitable as
the leader of the व्यूह; the rear (पृष्ठतः)
of the army was taken care of by Duḥ-
śāsana, seated on a huge elephant (महा-
द्विपस्कन्धगतः 8. 31. 19) and surrounded
by different armies; he was followed by
Duryodhana with his brothers on horse-backs,
and the Madras and the Kekayas to protect
him; Aśvatthāman, the Kuru heroes, and
elephants mounted by the Mlecchas were
behind the army of the chariot-fighters (अन्व-
युस् तद् रथानीकम्); they were assisted
by horse-men (सादिभिश् चास्थिताः); many
thousands of brave warriors, who would not
show their backs, armed with पट्टिश and
swords, acted as foot-guards of elephants and
of foot-soldiers (?) (तेषां पदातिनागानां
पादरक्षाः सहस्रशः 8. 31. 24); the
Bārhaspatya vyūha shone like the army of
the gods or of the Asuras 8. 31. 11-25.

बाहुकण्टक
Bāhukaṇṭaka nt.: Name of a particular
manœuvre employed in a wrestling match.
Karṇa employed it to split the joint in
Jarāsandha's body while wrestling with him
(but did not kill him) (बाहुभिः समसञ्-
जेताम् उभाव् अपि बलान्वितौ॥बाहुकण्टक-
युद्धेन तस्य कर्णो ऽथ युध्यतः
बिभेद सन्धिं देहस्य) 12. 5. 3-4 [बाहु-
कण्टकं (बहु-कण्टकं ?) केतकपत्रम्
तद्वद् यत्र बलिना दुर्बलस्य शरीरं
पाट्यते तद् बाहुकण्टकं नाम युद्धम्
Nī. on 12. 5. 4 (Bom. Ed.)].

बिभीषिका
Bibhīṣikā f.: A kind of माया used by
the Gandharvas to frighten men.
Arjuna told the Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa
that the Bibhīṣikā employed by him had no
effect on those who knew the use of the
अस्त्रस्; if employed, it vanished like foam
(अस्त्रज्ञेषु प्रयुक्तैषा फेनवत् प्रविली-
यते) 1. 158. 24.

ब्रह्मदण्ड
Brahmadaṇḍa m.: A weapon of Brah-
man (Nī., however, ब्रह्मदण्ड आभिचारि-
कविद्या on 2. 5. 122, Bom. Ed.).
Described as ‘very fierce’ (महाघोर),
‘having lustre like the fire on the Doom's
Day’ (कालाग्निसमतेजस्) 1. 49. 24; Nārada
asked Yudhiṣṭhira whether he knew the use
of the Brahmadaṇḍa 2. 5. 111; one of the
weapons placed by Śiva on his chariot when it
was made ready for the fight with the Tripuras
(other weapons placed on the chariot being
Kāladaṇḍa, Rudradaṇḍa) 8. 24. 79; Brahma-
daṇḍa used for various comparisons: (1) the
शक्ति hurled by Yudhiṣṭhira at Śalya and
which killed him was said to be ‘unfailing’
(अमोघा) like the Brahmadaṇḍa 9. 16. 42;
(2) the arrows of Arjuna which struck
Bhīṣma (6. 114. 57) had the touch of Brahma-
daṇḍa (ब्रह्मदण्डसमस्पर्शाः); and the
arrows with which Droṇa fought with Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna had the lustre of Brahmadaṇḍa
(शरांश् च ब्रह्मदण्डाभान्) 7. 164. 122;
the arrows of Rāma that killed Rāvaṇa
looked like a raised Brahmadaṇḍa 3. 274. 27;
(3) the गदा of Bhīma compared with a
raised Brahmadaṇḍa 5. 50. 8; (4) Rāvaṇa
hurled a शूल at Rāma which looked like a
raised Brahmadaṇḍa 3. 274. 19; (5) Garuḍa,
flying in the sky, appeared to Kaśyapa, his
father, like a raised Brahmadaṇḍa 1. 26. 7;
(6) enraged Sudhanvan, the son of Aṅgiras,
looked like the burning Brahmadaṇḍa 2. 61.
62; (7) the fear of the sacrificial fire which
the snake Vāsuki entertained due to his
mother's curse compared with Brahmadaṇḍa
1. 49. 22-24; (1. 52. 22 ?); [Brahmadaṇḍa
also means ‘punishment inflicted by the curse
of a Brāhmaṇa’ 1. 2. 220; 16. 4. 38].

ब्रह्मशिरस्
Brahmaśiras1 nt.: Name of a missile
(once called ब्रह्मास्त्र 10. 15. 21).
A. History: Supposed to have arisen
from Brahman's lustre (ब्रह्मतेजोभव
10. 15. 7); Droṇa, after practising severe
austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras
from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught
by Droṇa to Arjuna when he was satisfied
(प्रितिमान्, प्रीयमाणः) with him (Arjuna)
1. 123. 72; 10. 12. 5 and, not with great delight
(नातिहृष्टमनाः), to Aśvatthāman whom he
had apparently first refused to teach 10. 12. 6.
B. Description: powerful missile (पर-
मास्त्र) 1. 123. 78; 10. 15. 3, 6; famous as
‘uncomparable’ in the worlds (असामान्यम्
इदं तात लोकेष्व् अस्त्रं निगद्यते) 1. 123.
76; divine (दिव्य) 10. 15. 16; outstanding
(विशिष्ट) 1. 123. 74; highly irresistible (अति-
दुर्धर) 1. 123. 74; fiery (महार्चिष्मत्)
10. 14. 7; difficult to obtain (दुरवाप) 10.
15. 9; worshipped by gods and Gandharvas
(देवगन्धर्वपूजित) 10. 12. 14; capable of
burning the whole earth (दहेद् यद् पृथिवीम्
अपि) 10. 12. 4.
C. Restrictions on its
use: (1) while giving the अस्त्र to Arjuna,
Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but
to use it only if he was attacked in a battle
by a superhuman enemy (अमानुषः शत्रुः);
if released against an enemy of lesser mettle
(अल्पतेजस्), the missile would burn the
world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it
to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash
by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it
even under dire circumstances in battle, espe-
cially not against men (परमापद्गतेनापि
न स्म तात त्वया रणे।इदम् अस्त्रं
प्रयोक्तव्यं मानुषेषु विशेषतः) 10. 12.
7-8.
D. Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna
and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to
Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be dis-
tinguished among his pupils (विशिष्टं सर्व-
शिष्येभ्यः) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when
taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled
archer (भविता त्वत्समो नान्यः पुमाल्̃ लोके
धनुर्धरः) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught
to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal
(सप्रयोगनिवर्तनम्) 1. 123. 74; its with-
drawal very difficult; once released, no one
except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of
withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be with-
drawn by one who had not observed celibacy;
if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw
it, it would cut his head and destroy his
belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could with-
draw it as he was truthful, brave, had prac-
tised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher
10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified
to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the
epic war nor outside it, even under stress
(ब्रह्मचारी व्रती चापि दुरवापम् अवाप्य
तत्।परमव्यसनार्तो ऽपि नार्जुनो ऽस्त्रं
व्यमुञ्चत) 10. 15. 9, (ब्रह्मास्त्रम् अप्य्
अवाप्यैतद् … क्षत्रधर्मान् महाबाहुर्
नाकम्पत धनंजयः) 10. 15. 21; (2)
Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his
father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave
it to him but not with a pleased mind (नाति-
हृष्टमना इव) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthā-
man could not make use of it) he wanted to
exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana)
Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invin-
cible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give
any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman with-
out receiving from him in return his Brahma-
śiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose
the Cakra but failed even so much as to move
it from its place 10. 12. 20-23.
E. Use:
As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there
was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras
against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12.
40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an
इषीका, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his
Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down
from the chariot with bow and arrow in
hand, wished ‘well’ (स्वस्ति 10. 14. 5; 1. 1.
155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself
and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then
bowing down to deities and teachers, he
released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and
saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthā-
man's) missile’ (उत्ससर्ज शिवं ध्यायन्न्
अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण शाम्यताम्) 10. 14. 4-6; 10.
15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke
out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire
of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvat-
thāman's missile; as a result terror struck the
creatures, skies were filled with great sound
and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its
mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles
produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11;
just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, de-
siring welfare for all the people, appeared and
stood between the two missiles; they pointed
out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any
one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response
to their appeal, Arjuna immediately with-
drew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could
not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras
was pacified by the other powerful missile
(परमास्त्र) there would be no rain in the
land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthā-
man then directed his missile towards the
foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10.
16. 9. [See Iṣīkā, Brahmaśiras2, Brahmā-
stra]

ब्रह्मशिरस्
Brahmaśiras2 nt.: Name of the missile
of Śiva (Rudra) (identified with the fierce
(घोर), divine (दिव्य) Pāśupatāstra 3.
41. 7).
A. Origin: It arose from अमृत 3.
89. 11; Rudra acquired it with austerities
3. 89. 10.
B. Description: great (महत्)
and unrivalled (अप्रतिम) 3. 89. 10, fierce,
of terrible power (रौद्रं भीमपराक्र-
मम्) 3. 41. 8; 3. 89. 11; it destroys the
whole world at the time of the युगान्त 3.
41. 8.
C. Given to Arjuna: Arjuna
requested Śiva to give his Brahmaśiras
(Pāśupata); armed with it, Arjuna wanted
to burn in battle the Dānavas, the Rākṣasas,
the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the Gandharvas,
and the Pannagas; using it Arjuna wanted
to fight with Bhīṣma, Droṇa. Kṛpa, and
Karṇa 3. 41. 8-11; Arjuna received it from
Rudra together with the मन्त्रस् to be
recited at the time of its employment, the
mode of withdrawing it, and the benediction
meant for expiation (if wrongly used) सम-
न्त्रं ससंहारं सप्रायश्चित्तमङ्गलम्
3. 89. 11 (however, Nī. प्रायश्चित्तम् अस्त्रा-
ग्निना निरपराधानां दाहे यो दोषस् तस्य
शोधनम्।मङ्गलं दग्धानाम् एवारा-
मादीनां पुनर्विकसनम्। on Bom. Ed.
3. 91. 12).
D. Effect: When employed,
thousands of शूलस्, गदास्, and serpent-like
‘charmed’ arrows came out of it (शराश्
चाशीविषाकाराः संभवन्त्य् अनुमन्त्रिताः)
3. 41. 10. [See Pāśupata, Brahmaśiras1]

ब्रह्मास्त्र
Brahmāstra, Brāhma astra, (Paitā-
 maha) nt. (rarely pl. 7. 165. 22; 8. 29. 26):
Name of a missile.
A. Relationship with god Brahman:
Destined by god Brahman for repulsing all
other missiles (सर्वास्त्रप्रतिघाताय विहितं
पद्मयोनिना) 7. 172. 32; when withdrawn
by Kṛṣṇa from the stillborn Parikṣit, the
flaming missile returned to Pitāmaha
(Brahman) 14. 69. 1, 3.
B. Gods and
heroes who knew its use: (1) Among the
gods, Indra knew it 5. 47. 100; (2) Among
men: (i) Droṇa: He received it from Rāma
Jāmadagnya; when Droṇa received it, he
became distinguished among men 1. 154. 13;
Droṇa not equalled by any one in the use
of Brahmāstra; Drupada attributed his defeat
at the hands of Droṇa to Droṇa's know-
ledge of Brahmāstra 1. 155. 22; Droṇa un-
equalled in battle by any one because of his
knowledge of Brahmāstra (and other missiles)
( … ब्रह्मास्त्रादीनि यान्य् अपि।तानि सर्वाणि
तिष्ठन्ति भवत्य् एव विशेषतः) 7. 160. 5;
known for his knowledge of Brahmāstra,
Droṇa knew its use and remedy (सप्रयोग-
चिकित्सितम्) 3. 38. 5; 4. 46. 7, 9; 7. 166.
2; (ii) Arjuna: He was taught (निष्ठित)
Brāhma astra by his teacher (Droṇa) 1.
181. 20; 6. 116. 38; in its use, he never
violated the rules of the Kṣatriyas (क्षत्र-
धर्मान् महाबाहुर् नाकम्पत धनं-
जयः) 10. 15. 21; Arjuna was asked by
Indra to learn the Paitāmaha astra (identical,
or different from Brahmāstra ?) 3. 164. 29;
(iii-v) Bhīṣma, Kṛpa, and Aśvatthāman:
According to Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma, Kṛpa and
Aśvatthāman knew its use and remedy (स-
प्रयोगचिकित्सितम्) 3. 38. 5; 4. 46. 7 (Kṛpa
and Aśvatthāman); 4. 46. 9 (Aśvatthāmān);
(vi) Karṇa: Karṇa requested Droṇa to teach
him Brahmāstra together with its secret and
withdrawal, but Droṇa refused to oblige
12. 2. 10, 13; Karṇa, who coveted the Astra
(12. 3. 27, 30), then learnt it in its entirety
(कृत्स्नम्) from Rāma Jāmadagnya 12. 3.
2; 8. 5. 67; but since Karṇa had told a lie
to obtain its knowledge (12. 3. 30), Rāma
cursed him saying that the missile would flash
to him on all occasions except when he met
his equal and the time of his death had arrived
(ते … ब्रह्मास्त्रं प्रतिभास्यति।अन्यत्र
वधकातात् ते सदृशेन समेयुषः) 12. 3.
30-31; 5. 61. 2; returning, Karṇa reported
to Duryodhana that he had acquired the
missiles (from Rāma) (कृतास्त्रो ऽस्मि) 12. 3.
33; since Karṇa had pacified Rāma, knowledge
of Brahmāstra remained with him; hence
Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he was quite
capable of bearing the burden of the war
(ततस् तद् अस्त्रं मम सावशेषं तस्मात्
समर्थो ऽस्मि ममैष भारः) 5. 61. 2-4;
according to Yudhiṣṭhira, Karṇa knew the
use and remedy of Brahmāstra 3. 38. 5;
Karṇa boasted to Śalya that he knew the
Brāhma astras (pl. अस्त्राणि … ब्राह्माणी) 8.
29. 26; (vii) Kṛṣṇa: According to Bhīṣma,
perhaps Kṛṣṇa knew Brāhma and many
other heavenly weapons (कृष्णो वा देवकी-
पुत्रः) 6. 116. 39; (viii) Vibhīṣaṇa: He
prayed Brahman that the Brahmāstra might
flash to him although it was not duly taught
to him (अशिक्षितं च भगवन् ब्रह्मास्त्रं
प्रतिभातु मे) 3. 259. 30; [For its use also
by Yudhiṣṭhira, Kuvalāśva, Bṛhatkṣatra,
Pradyumna, Rāma (Dāśarathi), and Lakṣ-
maṇa see below section F].
C. Des-
cription: heavenly (दिव्य) 3. 271. 16; 7.
101. 12; 7. 160. 5; 7. 165. 22, 105; 8. 29. 27;
9. 61. 13, (19); great missile (महास्त्र)
3. 163. 33; 7. 165. 23; 8. 65. 23; (परम्
अस्त्रम्) 8. 66. 52; (परमास्त्र) 5. 185. 15;
best (उत्तम) 5. 185. 16; unrivalled (अप्र-
तिम) 8. 29. 27; dreadful (घोर) 3. 274.
27, (माहाघोर) 8. 5. 67; fierce (उग्र) 8.
65. 23; unbearable (असह्य) 8. 65. 24; of un-
matched strength (अप्रतिमौजस्) 3. 274. 27;
invincible even in thought (मनसा तद् ध्य्
अजय्यम्) 8. 29. 27; highly respected
(परमसंमत) 1. 154. 13; to be employ-
ed mentally (मनसा संविधेयम्) 8. 65.
24; cannot be withstood even by Indra 9.
61. 27.
D. Teaching of the अस्त्र: The
use of the missile was to be taught in full
(कृत्स्नम्), i. e. together with the mode of
its withdrawal; this is how Rāma Jāmadagnya
taught it to Karṇa after performing due rites
(तस्मै स विधिवत् कृत्स्नम् ब्रह्मास्त्रं
सनिवर्तनम्।प्रोवाच) 12. 3. 2; Droṇa
learnt from Rāma Jāmadagnya both—the
mode of its employment (प्रयोग) and with-
drawal (संहार) 1. 154. 11; when Karṇa
expressed his desire to learn it from Droṇa
he wanted to know it with its secrets and the
mode of its withdrawal (सरहस्यनिवर्तनम्)
12. 2. 10; Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa and
Aśvatthāman reputed for their knowledge of
the employment of the अस्त्र and its remedy
(i. e. withdrawal) (सप्रयोगचिकित्सितम्) 3.
38. 5; it could be taught only to a Brāh-
maṇa who had duly observed the prescribed
vow (यथावत् चरितव्रतः), or a Kṣatriya
who had practised austerities (तपस्वी), but
to none else 12. 2. 13; hence Karṇa told a
lie to Rāma Jāmadagnya about his lineage
while declaring that he was a Bhārgava Brāh-
maṇa 12. 2. 15; 12. 3. 26-30.
E. Use
and withdrawal: At the time of its employ-
ment, मन्त्रस् related to Brahmāstra were
recited on an arrow to use it as a charged
missile (बाणवर्यं … ब्रह्मास्त्रेणाभि-
मन्त्रितम्) 3. 274. 24-25; (ब्रह्मास्त्र-
परिमन्त्रितैः सायकैः) 3. 167. 17; (सं-
मन्त्र्य) 8. 66. 52; these मन्त्रस् used
to charge the arrow with the Brāhma (and the
other अस्त्रस्) were supposed to serve as
the ritual मन्त्रस् for the ‘sacrifice to be
performed with weapons’ (शस्त्रयज्ञ, i. e.
in the war) 5. 139. 31; it was necessary
to support the bow and the arrow with great
might (बलेनाथ स संस्तभ्य ब्रह्मा-
स्त्रं समुदैरयत्) 8. 66. 48; at the time of
withdrawing the Brahmāstra (Iṣīkā) employ-
ed by Aśvatthāman, Kṛṣṇa touched water
(उपस्पृश्य) 14. 68. 16, 14. 69. 1, and also
made a सत्यक्रिया 14. 68. 19-23.
F.
Uses: (1) In the epic war: (i) by
Droṇa—(a) against Arjuna in order to cut
down the भल्ल arrows 7. 67. 9 (समु-
दीरय-); 7. 163. 43 (प्रादुष्कृ-); 9.
61. 27; (b) against Yudhiṣṭhira to burn his

66. 53; 8. 67. 8; (ii) it produced fire enough
to heat the worlds and fill the directions
and space with lustre (ततः संतापितो लोको
मत्प्रसूतेन तेजसा।क्षणेन हि दिशः
खं च सर्वतो ऽभिविदीपितम्) 3. 163.
34; (जज्वाल) 5. 185. 16; (व्योम्नि पादुर्-
अभूत् तेजः) 5. 185. 18; (दीपयां चक्रे)
5. 186. 7; (तद् अस्त्रं ज्वलितम्) 14. 69. 3;

3. 274. 28; (iii) it produced smoke to fill the
directions 5. 185. 21; (iv) it produced
darkness all over which terrified creatures 7.
132. 33-34; (v) it removed the darkness
produced by the enemy's missile with the
result that cold winds blew and the directions
became clear 7. 172. 32; (vi) all life could
be threatened by it 5. 47. 101; 5. 185. 18,
20-21; 7. 163. 45; (vii) earth, with its

gods and other divine and demoniac beings
were heated with its blaze 5. 185. 19; or they
could not remain in the mid-region and they
bewailed 5. 185. 21-22; (ix) under its
influence the Rakṣases infested the residence;
they disappeared when the missile was with-
drawn 14. 69. 2.
H. Withdrawal: Bra-
hmāstra, when employed, either served the
purpose for which it was used, or was
repulsed, or pacified by the counter-use of the
same missile (cf. above sections F and G);
it was only once destroyed by Kirāta (Śiva) 3.
163. 35; only once when the same missile was
employed by the opponents they clashed in-
between without reaching the respective targets
5. 185. 17; Arjuna withdrew it (= Brahma-
śiras) 10. 15. 1, 5, but it (Iṣīkā identified
with Brahmāstra) could not be withdrawn
by Aśvatthāman as he had not observed the
ब्रह्मचारिव्रत 10. 15. 7-8; later Kṛṣṇa
withdrew it after sipping water (and making
a सत्यक्रिया) to revive the still-born child
14. 68. 16, (19-23); 14. 69. 1; when Kṛṣṇa
withdrew the Brahmāstra, brilliant light
emanated from the body of Parikṣit to fill
the room; the evil spirits (रक्षांसि) then left
the house and disappeared, and the mid-region
was filled with the words ‘well-done’ (साधु
केशव साध्व् इति) 14. 69. 1-2.
I. Com-
parison: the missile compared with the raised
Brahmadaṇḍa 3. 274. 27;

also the Gāndhāras, Sindhusauvīras, the
Śibis, and the Vasātis, moved with Droṇa to
protect him; Duryodhana, with his brothers,
and the Aśvātakas, the Vikarṇas, the Śar-
milas and the Kośalas, and many others took
positions to offer protection to the army of
Śakuni; Bhūriśravas, Śala, Śalya, Bhaga-

vyūha way (महाव्यूहः कलिङ्गानाम् 6. 50.
113); in that vyūha many elephants, horse-
men, and chariot fighters took part (नागा-
श्वरथसंकुलः); Bhīma, by himself,
was able to crush it 6. 50. 113; (3) Bhīṣma
arranged the Kaurava army according to the
Mahāvyūha on the eighth day of the war 6.
83. 5, 13, 15; it looked like an ocean (सागर-
प्रतिम) 6. 83. 5, (सागरोपम) 6. 83. 16;
the vyūha was led by Bhīṣma, accompanied

the ruler of Prasthalas accompanied by many
Kāṃbojas and the Yavanas in thousands;
Aśvatthāman followed Trigarta; behind
Aśvatthāman marched Duryodhana surround-
ed by his brothers; Kṛpa followed Duryo-
dhana 6. 83. 6-13; (4) The Pāṇḍavas
arranged their army in the Mahāvyūha way
(6. 95. 38) on the ninth day of the war
to counter the Sarvatobhadravyūha of the
Kauravas (6. 95. 26); in the forefront of
this vyūha stood Bhīmasena (6. 95. 40),
along with Yudhiṣṭhira, Nakula and Saha-
deva; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa and Sātyaki
apparently followed them; they seem to have
been followed by Śikhaṇḍin, Vijaya (Arjuna),
the Rākṣasa Ghaṭotkaca, Cekitāna and Kunti-
bhoja, all of them encircled by large armies;
the rear seems to have been made up by
Abhimanyu, Drupada, and five Kekaya
brothers (6. 95. 34-38); (but Arjuna had
advised Dhṛṣṭadyumna to see that Śikhaṇḍin
confronted Bhīṣma and that he would pro-
tect Śikhaṇḍin (शिखण्डिनं नरव्याघ्र
भीष्मस्य प्रमुखे ऽनघ।स्थापय-
स्वाद्य पाञ्चाल्य तस्य गोप्ताहम् अप्य् उत
6. 95. 25; according to Duryodhana's infor-

guard the left wheel of Arjuna and Utta-
maujas the right wheel 6. 95. 21).

महास्त्र
Mahāstra nt.: The ‘great’ missile, not

महास्त्रेण परेण मन्त्रवित्); he then
described his arrow as Mahāstra (अयम्
महास्त्रो ऽप्रतिमो धृतः शरः) 8. 67. 19;
he also strengthened it with the power of
truth by making a सत्यक्रिया (तपो ऽस्ति
तप्तं गुरवश् च तोषिता मया यद् इष्टं
सुहृदां तथा श्रुतम्।अनेन सत्येन नि-
हन्त्व् अयं शरः सुदंशितः कर्णं अरिं
ममाजितः) 8. 67. 20; the arrow was then
to work like a fierce अथर्वाङ्गिरसी magic

Rakṣasām astrāṇi nt. pl.: Missiles
special to Rakṣases.
Arjuna was to learn these after reaching
the residence of Indra 3. 164. 29-30.

राक्षस
Rākṣasa adj.: of the व्यूह (arrange-
ment of the army) known to the Rakṣases.
Bhīṣma knew these and is said to have
used them on different days along with those
known to the Asuras and the Piśācas 6.
104. 16.

रुद्राणाम्
Rudrāṇām astrāṇi nt. pl.: Missiles
special to the Rudras.
When Arjuna reached Indra's residence,
the Rudras, along with the other group-gods,
agreed to give their missiles to him 3. 164.
49-50; they figure in a bad omen: when
Garuḍa flew up from a mountain top to
fetch Soma from the heaven, there occurred
bad omens for the gods, one of them being
that the missile (प्रहरणम्) of the Rudras
clashed with those of the Vasus, the Ādityas,
the Sādhyas, the Maruts and the other hosts
of gods (ये चान्ये देवतागणाः); such a
thing had never happened before 1. 26. 29-30.

रुद्रास्त्र
Rudrāstra, Raudra astra nt.: Name
of a missile, special to Rudra (Śiva).
A. Description: Heavenly (दिव्य)
12. 5. 13-14; great (महास्त्र) 3. 170. 38;
fierce (घोर) 3. 170. 40; 7. 53. 43; eternal
(सनातन) 3. 170. 40; destroyer of all ene-
mies (सर्वामित्रविनाशन) 3. 170. 38; no
other weapon superior to it (अनुत्तम) 8. 66.
57.
B. Identified with the Pāśupata (and
the Brahmaśiras ?): When Arjuna prayed to
Śiva to give him the divine missiles, he agreed
to Arjuna's request and told him that his
Raudra missile would wait on him; he then
gave him his Pāśupata 3. 163. 47-48; Brahma-
śiras missile, which Arjuna received from
Rudra, also called Raudra (or adj. ‘fierce’
of Brahmaśiras (?)) 3. 41. 8.
C. Known
to Arjuna: Arjuna's collection of missiles
(अस्त्रग्राम 5. 166. 32) included Raudra
astra 3. 89. 10-11; Arjuna had received it
from Rudra 7. 53. 43; 12. 5. 13-14, and he
wanted to use it against the Kauravas at
the time of the cattle-raid 4. 56. 14.
D.
Mode of use: At the time of using it (against
Karṇa), Arjuna recited the मन्त्रस् (अनु-
मन्त्र्य) on the arrow on which he employed
it 8. 66. 58; at the time of charging his
arrow with the missile (to release it against
the Pauloma and the Kālakeya demons)
Arjuna bowed down to Rudra (रुद्राय
प्रणतो रणे) and wished well to the crea-
tures (स्वस्ति भूतेभ्यः); he bowed down
to Śarva (Rudra) again when he actually
released the missile from the bow (नमस्कृत्वा
त्रिनेत्राय शर्वायामिततेजसे) 3. 170. 38, 41.
E. Uses: 1. In the epic war: (i) Arjuna
wanted to employ it on a heavenly arrow,
resembling fire or snake's poison and which
was hard like a stone, and release it against
Kaṛṇa 8. 66. 58-59; there is no mention
of Arjuna having released it, but it seems
that he warded off Karṇa's Brahmāstra with it
(not named; तद् अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेणावार्य प्रज-
हारास्य पाण्डवः) 8. 67. 8; (ii) Aśva-
tthāman killed the followers of Dhṛṣṭadyumna
who surrounded him after he killed Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna at night in the camp of the Pāṇḍavas
10. 8. 31-32; 2. Outside the epic war: (i)
Arjuna used it to burn with its fire the
Nivātakavaca demons 5. 136. 7; (ii) Arjuna
used it to kill the Pauloma and the Kālakeya
demons; Arjuna first used all his other missiles
without being able to defeat the demons, but
was himself oppressed by them; at that time he
was afraid; he bowed to Rudra and employed
the great Raudra missile on his arrow (महा-
स्त्रं समयोजयम्); he then saw a man
having three heads, nine eyes, three mouths,
six hands, burning, his hair bright like the
sun or fire, his head covered with big snakes
(ततो ऽपश्यं त्रिशिरसं पुरुषं नवलोच-
नम्।त्रिमुखं षड्भुजं दीप्तम् अर्क-
ज्वलनमूर्धजम्॥लेलिहानैर् महानागैः
कृतशीर्षम्) 3. 170. 38-39; when the missile
was next actually released (मुक्तमात्रे ततस्
तस्मिन्) thousands of different shapes—wild
animals like lions, tigers, bears, buffalos,
as also snakes, cows, elephants, सृमरस्,
शरभस्, bulls, boars, wild cats, शालावृकस्,
ghosts, भुरुण्डस्, vultures, eagles, crocodiles,
Piśācas, Yakṣas, demons, Guhyakas, Nairṛtas,
big fishes having mouths of elephants, owls,
hosts of fishes and tortoises, shapes holding
different weapons and swords, Yātudhānas
holding गदा and मुद्गर, and many
others—came out from the missile and filled
the space; the demons were killed by many
shapes having three heads, four tusks, four
mouths, four hands, as also by the arrows of
Arjuna which shone like the sun and the fire,
which were brilliant like the Vajra and
lightning, and hard like rocks; when the
demons were killed by the Raudrāstra, Arjuna
bowed down to Tripuraghna (Śiva) once
again 3. 170. 42-51.

वज्र
Vajra1 nt. (m. 4. 2. 13; 12. 273. 7;
12. 31. 29): A missile generally associated
with Indra, but also on a few occasions
with Kṛṣṇa and Śiva; also called Kuliśa
(कुलिशं मघवान् इव) 3. 12. 43; 8. 13. 20.
I. As Indra's missile:
A. Origin: Three
accounts: (1) when the Kāleya demons, under
the leadership of Vṛtra, attacked Indra and the
other gods, Brahman advised them to approach
the sage Dadhīca and ask him for his bones in
order to fashion a Vajra out of it; with that
Vajra, Indra was to kill Vṛtra 3. 98. 3-11;
when the gods received the bones of Dadhīca,
they took them to Tvaṣṭṛ and asked him to
fashion a Vajra out of the bones; Tvaṣṭṛ,
ritually ready (प्रयत) to receive the bones,
was glad to fashion the Vajra which he did
with great effort (प्रयत्नात्) 3. 98. 22; when
the Vajra was ready, Tvaṣṭṛ asked Indra
to reduce his enemies to ashes with the
excellent Vajra (वज्रप्रवर); Indra too
was happy and ritually ready (प्रयत)
to receive it 3. 98. 23-24; (2) Vajra created
from the bones of Dadhīca in order to kill the
three-headed Viśvarūpa, son of Tvaṣṭṛ; when
the Vajra was fashioned by Dhātṛ, Viṣṇu
entered it (विष्णुप्रविष्ट); with the Vajra,
thus fortified, Indra cut off the heads of
Viśvarūpa 12. 329. 25-27; 1. 127. 12; (3)
during a conflict between the gods and the
demons Indra searched the three worlds for a
suitable weapon, but did not find it; he asked
the gods to approach the sage Dadhīca to ask
for his bones; when the bones were received,
Indra got prepared out of them various
divine missiles like वज्रस् (pl.), discuses,
maces, and heavy दण्डस् (कारयाम् आस
दिव्यानि नानाप्रहरणान्य् उत।वज्राणि
चक्राणि गदा गुरुदंडांश् च पुष्कलान्);
with this Vajra produced from the lustre of a
Brāhmaṇa (Dadhīca) and employed with the
recitation of the मन्त्रस् (तेन वज्रेण …
मन्त्रयुक्तेन … ब्रह्मतेजोभवेन च),
Indra killed nine times ninety (नवतीर् नव
9. 50. 33) Daityas and Dānavas 9. 50. 25-33.
B. Description: Heavenly (दिव्य) 12. 31.

large (महत्) 3. 98. 10; fiery (वैश्वान-
रनिभ) 5. 9. 22; having great lustre
(सुमहातेजाः mas.) 12. 273. 7; (अमितते-
जस्) 14. 11. 15, 17; (भूरितेजस्) 14. 11.
9, 11, 13; called big lightning (महाशनि)
1. 218. 30; looking like the fire at the time of
the destruction of the world (कालाग्निसदृशो-
पमः mas.) 12. 273. 7; having six edges
(षडश्र) 3. 98. 10; producing terrific sound
(भीमनिस्वन) 3. 98. 10; produced from
the bones of a Brāhmaṇa (ब्रह्मास्थि-
संभूत) 12. 329. 27; produced from the
lustre of a Brāhmaṇa (ब्रह्मतेजोभव)
9. 50. 33; killer of the enemies (शत्रुहन्)
3. 98. 10; killer of the Dānavas (दानव-
सूदन) 1. 127. 12.
C. Indra's proper
weapon: Dear weapon of Indra (इन्द्रस्य
दयितं वज्रम्) 1. 26. 28; 3. 45. 4; 3. 169.
13; hence Indra has epithets like वज्रिन्

holding the वज्र (वज्रग्रहणचिह्नेन
करेण बलसूदनः) 3. 44. 25; Indra him-
self called Vajra 1. 21. 10; Indra boasts that
he does not strike his Vajra against the
weak (न दुर्बले वै विसृजामि वज्रम्)
14. 9. 29; that Vajra is the proper weapon
of Indra is also brought out by such ex-
pressions as: the armour with which Duryo-
dhana was equipped by Droṇa could not be
pierced by Indra with his Vajra 7. 78. 13;
Karṇa told Śalya that no one, not even
Indra with his raised Vajra, can dissuade
him from his resolve to fight with Arjuna
8. 27. 29; or Indra's telling Karṇa to ask
for anything except his Vajra 3. 294. 19.
D. Use by Indra: 1. Incidents related
to the epic: (i) Indra released his lustrous
missile (स्वम् अस्त्रम् असृजद् दीप्तम्), not
named, against Arjuna at the time of the
Khāṇḍava fire; it produced lightnings;
Arjuna repelled it by Vāyavya astra 1. 218.
13, 15-16; Indra took up a thunderbolt
(अशनि, महाशनि), and, charging it with
Vajra missile, released it against Kṛṣṇa and
Arjuna (अशनिं गृह्य तरसा वज्रम्
अस्त्रम् अवासृजत्), and told the gods that
the two were killed 1. 218. 29-30; Kṛṣṇa
paralysed Indra who wanted to strike him
with Vajra (reference to the Khāṇḍava fire ?)
13. 143. 26, 23; (ii) when Indra could not
dissuade Uttaṅka from desisting to dig the
earth with just a stick, he joined his Vajrāstra
with the stick; the earth, torn asunder by the
strokes of Vajra, made way for Uttaṅka to
go to the Nāgaloka 14. 57. 31-32; 2. Inci-
dents not related to the epic: (i) Indra
threatened king Marutta, first through Agni,
that in case the king did not forsake Saṃ-
varta who acted as his priest at the sacri-
fice, he would hurl his Vajra at him 14. 9. 24;
he again threatened Marutta, through the Gan-
dharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra, that he would use his
Vajra against the king 14. 10. 1, 2, 4, 7;
Saṃvarta, however, assured Marutta that if
Indra with his Vajra arrived to strike the
king, he would paralyse Indra, and that he
had destroyed before the weapons of all the
gods; Saṃvarta then said: “let the wind
blow and may it drive away the Vajra to the
directions; let there be rain and may it fall
on the forests; let waters float in the mid-
region and let there be lightning in the sky
(दिशो वज्रं व्रजतां वायुर् एतु वर्षं
भूत्वा निपततु काननेषु।आपः प्लवन्त्व्
अन्तरिक्षे वृथा च सौदामिनी दृश्यतां मा
बिभस् त्वम्॥) 14. 10. 13; (वज्रं तथा
स्थापयतां च वायुः) 14. 10. 14; Marutta
was still afraid of the sound of Vajra and of
the winds, and then Saṃvarta again assured
the king that he would become wind and
strike down the Vajra to dispel the king's
fear 14. 10. 15-16; (ii) Indra asked his
missile Vajra in the bodily form (मूर्तिसंस्-
थित) to turn into a tiger and kill Suvarṇa-
ṣṭhīvin, son of king Sṛñjaya, as he was
afraid of the prince's growing strength 12.
31. 27-28; when Vajra (वज्रः) was so
addressed, he began to look for a suitable
opportunity and when it arrived he, as tiger,
killed Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin; after killing the
prince, the tiger disappeared by the माया of
Indra 12. 31. 29-34; (iii) when the sage
Cyavana wanted to offer Soma to Aśvinā
Indra objected to it; in spite of the objec-
tion, when Cyavana was about to fill
the cup for the Aśvinā, Indra threatened
Cyavana to strike him with Vajra; when
Cyavana still proceeded to fill the cup, and
Indra was about to strike the Vajra, Cyavana
paralysed Indra's arm 3. 124. 8, 15-17; 14. 9.
31-32; 12. 329. 14(3); 3. Mythological
incidents: (i) Vṛtra episode: (a) in the
battle between the gods and Vṛtra, helped by
the Kālakeyas, Indra released his Vajra to kill
Vṛtra; when struck by the Vajra, Vṛtra was
killed 3. 99. 1-3, 13-14; however, Indra felt
as if he had not released the Vajra from his
hand and that Vṛtra was not killed 3. 99. 15;
(b) when the gods approached Viṣṇu for his
help in their fight against Vṛtra, Viṣṇu advised
them to establish peace for the time being
with Vṛtra, and when the proper time came he
would enter the Vajra of Indra 5. 10. 11-12;
Vṛtra was ready to make peace if he would
not be attacked by Indra or by the gods with
anything that was dry or wet, which was stone
or wood, which was a weapon (शस्त्र) or
Vajra, and if they would strike neither by
day nor by night 5. 10. 29; Indra killed Vṛtra
with foam which was fortified with Vajra;
Viṣṇu had entered that foam (सवज्रम्
अथ फेनं तं क्षिप्रं वृत्रे निसृष्ट-
वान्।प्रविश्य फेनं तं विष्णुर् अथ
वृत्रं व्यनाशयत्) 5. 10. 38; 3. 299. 15;
(c) Maheśvara told Indra to kill Vṛtra
with Vajra; Indra agreed 12. 272. 38-39; in
the fight that ensued, Indra came with Vajra
in his hand; he struck Vṛtra with Vajra; the
Vajra (m.) killed him; Viṣṇu had entered the
Vajra 12. 273. 5-7, 9; 12. 272. 31; 12. 274. 2;
(d) in the fight between Indra and Vṛtra,
when the latter covered the earth, Indra re-
leased his Vajra at him; Vṛtra then entered
successively water, fire, wind, and then ran
to ether (आकाश); each time Indra struck
him with Vajra; finally Vṛtra entered Śakra
(Indra); in that condition Indra struck Vṛtra
with an invisible Vajra (अदृश्येन वज्रेण)
14. 11. 6-19; (ii) Viśvarūpa-Triśiras
episode: (a) when the gods led by Indra
approached god Brahman complaining that
Viśvarupa (Triśiras), son of Tvaṣṭṛ, drank
away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that
they were left without a share, Brahman
advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca
and request him to give up his body; the gods
should then fashion a Vajra from the bones
of Dadhīca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhīca
gave up his body, Dhātṛ fashioned a Vajra
out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced
from the bones of a Brāhmaṇa and in which
god Viṣṇu had entered, Indra killed Viśvarūpa
and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b)
when Indra failed to tempt Triśiras, son of
Tvaṣṭṛ, with Apsarases while he was practis-
ing penance, he decided to strike Vajra at
him; when struck by Vajra, Triśiras fell down
like the summit of a mountain; Indra was
still afraid of Triśiras and he asked a wood-
cutter (तक्षन्) to cut off the heads of the
lying Triśiras assuring Takṣan that he would
make his axe Vajra-like (मत्प्रसादाद् धि
ते शस्त्रं वज्रकल्पं भविष्यति 5. 9. 27);
the woodcutter finally cut off the heads of
Triśiras with his axe 5. 9. 15-34; (iii) Meet-
ing of Bali and Indra: when Indra met Bali
in the form of a donkey (खर 12. 216. 12),
Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra
with his fist although Indra was equipped with
Vajra, but that that was the time to show for-
bearance (क्षमा) and not valour (विक्रम)
12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told
Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman
not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his
Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra
asked Bali why he was not grieved although
he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220.
18; Bali told Indra that he was not afraid of
him (Indra) although he saw him with his
Vajra raised (वज्रम् उद्यम्य तिष्ठन्तम्)
12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tran-
quility of Bali for he was not afraid of Indra
with Vajra raised in his hand 12. 220. 89;
(iv) Garuḍa episode: on his way to fetch
अमृत, when Garuḍa flew to the mountain
whose caves were blocked with snow, there
were bad omens for the gods; Indra's dear
missile Vajra blazed with pain (इन्द्रस्य
वज्रं दयितं प्रजज्वाल व्यथान्वितम्) 1.
26. 28; when Garuḍa was taking away अमृत,
Indra struck him with Vajra; Garuḍa smiled
and told Indra that just out of respect for the
sage (Dadhīca) from whose bones the Vajra
was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself,
and Indra, he would let fall just one of his
feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the
missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra
sought friendship with Garuḍa 1. 29. 17-23;
(v) Fight between the gods and Skanda:
when during the fight between the gods and
Skanda, the gods abandoned Indra, he released
his Vajra at Skanda; it struck Skanda on his
right side and split it open; due to the impact
of Vajra was produced another young man
(पुरुषो ऽपरः।युवा) with golden armour,
wearing heavenly कुण्डलस्, and holding
शक्ति; he became Viśākha since he was pro-
duced due to वज्रविशन (यद् वज्रविशनाज्
जातो विशाखस् तेन सो ऽभवत्) 3. 216. 12-
14 [विशन ‘opening made by the Vajra’ ?
Nīla.: ‘digging up of the arm’ बाहोर्
आखननात् Bom. Ed. 3. 227. 17]; (vi)
Śiva and Indra: (a) Śiva, in the form of a
child in the lap of Umā, froze the arm of
Śakra which held Vajra (since apparently
Indra wanted to strike Vajra at the child
not realising that the child was Śiva); when
Brahmā and the other gods propitiated Śiva
(Rudra) and Umā, Indra's hand, holding the
Vajra, became as before 7. 173. 60-63; 13.
145. 30-34; (b) Indra once desirous to have
Maheśvara's glory hurled his Vajra at him;
it burnt Maheśvara's throat and departed;
that is why Śiva is called Śrīkaṇṭha (तेन
श्रीकण्ठता मम; Nīla. श्रकण्ठता = नील-
कण्ठता on Bom. Ed. 13. 127. 47) 13. 128.
8; (vii) Indra and Mandara: Mandara, son
of Hiraṇyakaśipu, fought with Indra for a
million years; due to the boon he had obtained
from Mahādeva (Śiva) Indra's Vajra was
shattered on the limbs of the “tormentor”
(ग्रह ?) Mandara 13. 14. 53-54 (Nī.
ग्रहस्य मन्दारनाम्नः on Bom. Ed.
13. 14. 75).
E. Knowledge of Vajra by
Arjuna and its use by him: Arjuna learnt
(अधीतवान्) the Vajra missile from Indra
(and other missiles from Yama, Kubera,
and Varuṇa) 3. 89. 12; (i) Mātali advised
Arjuna to use Indra's favourite missile
against the Nivātakavaca demons; Arjuna
released (उदीरय-) it after resorting to a
firm place (अचलं स्थानम् आसाद्य) and
after reciting the मन्त्रस् on the Gāṇḍīva
bow (गाण्डीवम् अनुमन्त्र्य च); the result
was that the sharp, iron arrows released from
his bow had the impact of Vajra (अमुञ्चं
वज्रसंस्पर्सान् आयसान् निशिताञ् शरान्);
the arrows, propelled by the Vajra and which
had themselves become Vajra-like (ते वज्र-
चोदिता बाणा वज्रभूताः) pierced the मायास्
of the demons and the demons themselves;
they all fell down on the ground when struck
by the impact (वेग) of Vajra; the arrows
killed also those demons who had entered the
ground 3. 169. 12-17; (ii) Arjuna used the
Vajra missile to kill the Saṃśaptaka warriors
who showered arrows at Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
to completely cover them 7. 26. 19-20.
F. As standard of comparison; Various things
compared with Vajra: 1. arrows: of Arjuna
6. 114. 55, 57; 7. 68. 56; 7. 78. 10; 8. 21. 32;
8. 55. 3; 8. 67. 16; 14. 73. 29; 14. 78. 27;

the Pāṇḍya king 8. 15. 13; 7. strong arms
8. 23. 26; 8. hard heart 7. 50. 49; 8. 5. 24;
9. 2. 4; 12. 171. 23; 9. the Makaravyūha
6. 76. 5 (वज्रकुल्पः; Vajra = the missile or
the Vajravyūha ?) 10. sound produced while
fighting with different objects compared with
that of the Vajra: (i) sound produced by
arrows 7. 141. 21; (ii) by various wea-
pons 7. 141. 23; (iii) by गदा 9. 56. 60;
(iv) by summits of mountains hurled as
missiles 7. 153. 26; (v) by fists 7. 152.
44; (vi) by bow-string 5. 47. 47; 7. 73.
16; 9. 16. 14; 11. warriors or elephants
falling on the battle-field compared with the
mountains (or their summits) falling down
when struck by (Indra's) Vajra: (i) warriors
(or their heads, or head-gears) 6. 42. 19;
7. 53. 40; 8. 15. 38; 8. 40. 105; 8. 66. 17;
8. 66. 31 (only distressed); 8. 67. 26; 12. 27.
5 (only shaking); (ii) elephants (some-
times along with their riders) 4. 60. 10;
(4. 60. 12); 6. 58. 34; 6. 112. 35; 7. 28. 38;
7. 48. 43; 7. 66. 18; 7. 68. 51; 7. 123. 39; 8.
8. 44; 8. 12. 40; (8. 12. 44); 8. 13. 15; 8. 13.
20 (कुलिश); 8. 17. 27; 8. 14. 12; 8. 33. 51;
8. 43. 67; 8. 54. 5; 8. 59. 13; 8. 62. 43, 45, 46;
8. 68. 16; 9. 8. 27; 9. 19. 26; (iii) heroes
struck by arrows compared with trees struck
by Vajra 6. 70. 24; 6. 103. 91; 7. 172. 23;
12. fight between two heroes compared
with that between Vajra and the mountain:
between Bhīma and Jarāsandha 2. 21. 11;
between Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) and the
Kauravas 5. 3. 15; between Pradyumna and
his opponents 5. 3. 19; between Ghaṭotkaca
and Alaṃbala 7. 149. 26; 13. fear, like
the burning Vajra, torments the timid ones
in the army 12. 103. 23.
G. Its use
for punishment and not as a missile:
(1) Sudhanvan warned Prahlāda that if,
in reply to a question, he told what was
false, Indra would pound his head with Vajra
into hundred pieces 2. 61. 63; (2) Bṛha-
spati told the gods what had been proclaimed
by Brahman in ancient times (पुरा गीतं
ब्रह्मणा 5. 12. 18): if one hands over
to the enemy the person who has sought
refuge, the gods with Indra strike him with
Vajra 5. 12. 21.
H. Status: The best
among the weapons (आयुधानां वरो वज्रः
(m.)) 4. 2. 13; an object of worship and
honour: (i) when Vajra struck Vṛtra's
head, it (the Vajra) was shattered into ten,
and then into hundred pieces; the gods shared
the pieces of Vajra among themselves and
worshipped them; (ii) whatever is efficaci-
ous in the world is supposed to have the
built of Vajra (लोके यत् साधनं किंचित्
सा वै वज्रतनुः स्मृता 1. 158. 48);
hence a Brāhmaṇa's hand is considered
to be made of Vajra, a Kṣatriya has his
chariot of Vajra, a Vaiśya's gift is as
efficacious as Vajra, and those junior to a
Vaiśya (the Śūdras) are supposed to have
Vajra's strength in their service; the horses
of a Kṣatriya are as good as Vajra and
hence they are inviolable (वज्रपाणिर् ब्राह्-
मणः स्यात् क्षत्रं वज्ररथं स्मृतम्।
वैश्या वै दानवज्राश् च कर्मवज्रा यवी-
यसः॥वज्रं क्षत्रस्य वाजिनो अवध्या
वाजिनः स्मृताः) 1. 158. 49-50; however,
Vajra made ineffectual when Nīlakaṇṭha
(Śiva) granted a boon to Nārāyaṇa that
Vajra will not have any effect on him 7.
172. 77-78.
II. As Kṛṣṇa's missile: Kṛṣṇa cut off
all the mountains hurled at him by a demon
fighting from the side of Śālva, with his
dear missile Vajra which was capable of
breaking all rocks (सर्वपाषाणभेदन)
3. 23. 17.
III. As Śiva's missile: Śiva is called
वज्रिन् 7. 172. 59; 13. 15. 11; 13. 17. 128;
and वज्रहस्त 13. 17. 70.
IV. Vajra as a general missile, not
associated with any individual: Many Vajras
were used during the fight between Bhīma
and Karṇa 7. 113. 20; Vajras were used by the
Rākṣasas of Ghaṭotkaca against the Kaurava
army 7. 154. 36; even the blades of grass
acted like Vajras when the time was ripe
(mode of expression) (पक्वानां हि वधे
सूत वज्रायन्ते तृणान्य् अपि) 7. 10. 47.

वज्र
Vajra2 m.: Name of a व्यूह (a parti-
cular arrangement of the army).
A. Origin: It was designed by Indra
(विहितं वज्रपाणिना) 6. 19. 7.
B. Des-
cription: highly invincible (परमदुर्-
जय) 6. 19. 7; (अजेयो मानुषे लोके) 6. 19.
35; immovable (अचल) 6. 19. 7; difficult
to penetrate (दुर्भिद), watching on all
sides (सर्वतोमुख), and terrible (घोर)
6. 19. 34.
C. Use in the epic war:
(1) Arjuna arranged the Pāṇḍava army
according to this Vyūha on the first day of
the war 6. 19. 6-7, 35; Bhīma led it
(भीमसेनो ऽग्रणीस् तेषाम्) 6. 19. 18,
(दृष्ट्वाग्रतो भीमसेनम्) 6. 19. 44,
(भीमसेनो … प्रचकर्ष महत् सैन्यम्)
6. 19. 32; 6. 19. 8, 9; also in the forefront
stood Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and
Dhṛṣtaketu; Nakula and Sahadeva acted as
the protectors of the wheels of Bhīma's
chariot (चक्ररक्षौ 6. 19. 20), and the
sons of Draupadī and Abhimanyu protected
Bhīma from behind (पृष्ठगोपाः 6. 19. 20);
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas,
offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21);
the king (Virāṭa ?), surrounded by an army,
अक्षौहिणी strong, together with his brothers
and sons guarded them from behind;
Śikhaṇḍin, guarded by Arjuna, followed them;
Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) protected Arjuna
from behind (पृष्ठगोप) and Yudhā-
manyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheel-
protectors (चक्ररक्षौ); Yudhiṣṭhira, with
elephants, took position in the middle; the
Pāñcāla king Yajñasena with an army,
अक्षौहिणी strong, marched behind Virāṭa;
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, having moved from
his position, with his brothers and sons,
protected Yudhiṣṭhira from behind; hundreds
and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the
front to protect Bhīmasena, while ten thou-
sand elephants followed Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 19.
18-31; according to 6. 22. 1-6, where the
name of the Vyūha is not mentioned but
the description of which apparently applies to
the arrangement of the Pāṇḍava army on the
first day, Yudhiṣṭhira himself directed the
contingents (अनीकानि) of his army to counter
the Vyūha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhīṣma;
Śikhaṇḍin's contingent stood in the middle,
protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna's contingent was protected by Bhīma
himself; the contingent on the right side of the
Vyūha (अनीकं दक्षिणम्) was protected by
Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); Yudhiṣṭhira's chariot
was stationed in the midst of elephants;
Bhīma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is
said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero
(वीररथस्य गोप्ता i. e. Arjuna ? Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna ?), but his position seems to be in
the front of the army (सेनाग्रगतम्) 6.
22. 12-13; in many respects, this description
of the Vyūha agrees with that of the Vajra
given above (6. 19. 18-31); (2) On the
seventh day of the war Yudhiṣṭhira himself
used the Vajravyūha for his army (of which
no details are available) to counter the
Maṇḍalavyūha of the Kaurava army 6. 77. 21.

वसूनाम्
Vasūnām astram (or astrāṇi) nt.
(sg. or pl.): A missile (or missiles), not
named, special to the Vasus.
Arjuna was to learn them from the
Vasus after reaching the residence of Indra
3. 164. 29; Vasus agreed to give their missiles
to him 3. 164. 49-50. [See Vasūnāṃ
praharaṇam]

वसूनां
Vasūnāṃ praharaṇam nt.: The weapon
of the Vasus, not named.
When Garuḍa flew up from the moun-
tain top to fetch the Soma from the heaven,
bad omens occurred for the gods, one of them
being that the weapon of the Vasus clashed
with that of the Rudras, the Ādityas, the
Sādhyas, the Maruts and the other hosts of
gods (ये चान्ये देवतागणाः); such a
thing had never happened before 1. 26.
29-30. [See Vasūnām astram]

वायव्यास्त्र
Vāyavyāstra, (Vāyavya) nt. (rarely pl.
1. 225. 12): Name of a missile related to
god Vāyu 3. 164. 29; to Vāta 3. 161. 28;
to Mātariśvan 4. 56. 14.
A. Description: heavenly (दिव्य)
5. 181. 13; 7. 132. 28; best (उत्तम) 1. 218.
15; very fierce (सुदारुण) 6. 98. 20.
B. Its
knowledge: Arjuna learnt it from god Vāyu
when he, after satisfying Mahādeva (Śiva),
received it in the heaven along with many
other heavenly weapons 1. 225. 12 (pl.
वायव्यानि); 3. 164. 29; 3. 161. 28 (Vāta);
4. 56. 14 (Mātariśvan); 6. 116. 38; but
apparently he had also learnt it earlier
from Droṇa since he used it while displaying
his skill in archery (1. 125. 19), and at
the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest
(1. 218. 15); Droṇa, of course, knew it,
and it was known to many other epic heroes,
viz. Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa, Aśvatthāman,
Yudhiṣṭhira, and the Pāṇḍya king (see the
next section); it was known also, perhaps, to
Kṛṣṇa 6. 116. 39.
C. Use: (1) In the epic
war: (i) by Arjuna, agaisnt the Trigartas;
noticing its employment, Droṇa repelled it
with the Śaila astra 6. 98. 18-20; against
the Saṃśaptakas, to scatter their shower of
arrows, when they covered Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
with their arrows; the two, therefore, could
not be seen and were mistaken to be dead
7. 18. 17-22; god Vāyu carried away
the Saṃśaptakas together with their horses,
elephants, chariots and weapons like dried
leaves; they looked like birds flying from
trees 7. 18. 17-23; agaisnt Droṇa to repel
the Vāyavyāstra released by him 7. 163. 28
(here not specifically named: अस्तृआण्य् अस्त्रैर्
यदा तस्य विधिवद् धन्ति पाण्डवः);
against Karṇa, to scatter the clouds created
by his Vāruṇāstra 8. 67. 11; (ii) by
Droṇa, against Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 28; again
against Yudhiṣṭhira, when Droṇa was for
a moment distressed by Yudhiṣṭhira's arrow
and had to sit down in the chariot 7. 137.
40-42; against the army of king Drupada
to blow it away, as wind blows away the
clouds 7. 136. 10; 7. 132. 37; against Arjuna
7. 163. 28; (iii) by Yudhiṣṭhira, to combat
successfully the same Astra used against him
by Droṇa (अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण जघ्निवान्)
7. 132. 28; again to halt the same Astra used
against him by Droṇa (तद् अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण
रणे स्तम्भयाम् आस) 7. 137. 42; (iv) by
Aśvatthāman, against Ghaṭotkaca to blow him
away (व्यधमत्) when Ghaṭotkaca em-
ployed his माया to become a dark cloud to
attack Aśvatthāman 7. 131. 71-72; (v) by
Karṇa, against Ghaṭotkaca under similar
conditions 7. 150. 70-71; (vi) by the
Pāṇḍya king, to obstruct (रुध्-) the shower
of arrows released by Aśvatthāman
on his army 8. 15. 30-31; (2) Outside the
epic war—(i) Arjuna used it by reciting
मन्त्रस् (अभिमन्त्र्य) to dispel the clouds
and the lightning created by Vāyu and Indra
at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest
1. 218. 15; Arjuna used it against Kirāta
(Śiva), but the missile had no effect on
him 3. 163. 29-30; against Droṇa at the
time of the cattle-raid to swallow the Vāya-
vyāstra used by Droṇa (वायव्यं …
अस्त्रम् अस्त्रेण पाण्डवः। … ग्रसते
स्म … ) 4. 53. 48; against Bhīṣma at the
time of the cattle raid 4. 59. 21; at the
time of displaying his skill in the use of
missiles 1. 125. 19; (ii) by Bhīṣma, against
Arjuna at the time of the cattle-raid 4. 59.
21; against Rāma Jāmadagnya who combated
it with the use of the Guhyakāstra 5. 181.
11; (iii) by Droṇa, against Arjuna at the
time of the cattle-raid 4. 53. 48; (iv) the
effect of the Vāyavyāstra was produced by
the Nivātakavaca demons by employing
their माया while fighting with Arjuna; it
produced wind, the velocity of which was
obstructed by Arjuna by the use of the Śaila
astra (शैलेन च महास्त्रेण वायोर् वेगम्
अधारयम्) 3. 168. 9-10; the demons again
practised their different मायास् simultaneously
(प्राकुर्वन् विविधा माया यौगपद्येन)
and produced the Astra of Vāyu (along
with that of Agni and the Aśmavarṣa); it
oppressed Arjuna and produced darkness all
around, which was dispelled by Arjuna
by employing his Astramāyā 3. 168.
11-13, 25-26.
D. Effects: Arjuna
created wind by the use of the Vāyavya astra
(वायव्येनासृजद् वायुम्) 1. 125. 19; the
wind that was released by the use of the
missile agitated the sky, felled the trees, and
killed soldiers 6. 98. 18-20; when used against
the Saṃśaptakas, god Vāyu (भगवान्
वायुः) swept them away together with their
horses, elephants, chariots and weapons, like
dried leaves; they appeared like birds flying
away from trees 7. 18. 22-23. [See
Vāyuvarṣa]

वायुवर्ष
Vāyuvarṣa nt.: A missile (?) of the
Nivātakavaca demons produced by their
माया।
The Nivātakavaca demons employed
their various मायास् simultaneously (प्राकुर्-
वन् विविधा माया यौगपद्येन) against
Arjuna which produced, besides other missiles,
the Vāyuvarṣa; it afflicted Arjuna; as a
result of the simultaneous use of these
missiles there was darkness all around 3. 168.
11-13; Arjuna used his Astramāyā to defeat
the मायास् of the demons 3. 168. 25-26;
earlier also the Nivātakavaca demons
had produced wind blowing with velocity
apparently by using the same Vāyuvarṣa
missile produced by the माया; Arjuna
obstructed the velocity of the wind (वायोर्
वेगम् अधारयम्) by using the Śaila astra
3. 168. 9-10. [See Vāyavyāstra]

वारुण
Vāruṇa1 adj. (pl.): of the Pāśas of
Varuṇa 12. 220. 18. [See Pāśa]

वारुण
Vāruṇa2 adj.: of Gāṇḍiva bow, originally
belonging to Varuṇa.
It is one of the three divine bows
belonging to celestial beings (दिव्यानि
धनूंषि दिविचारिणाम्), the other two
being Vijaya of Mahendra and Śārṅga of
Viṣṇu 5. 155. 5-6. [See Gāṇḍīva]

वारुण
Vāruṇa3 adj. (du.): of the two quivers
of Varuṇa.
Described as heavenly (दिव्यौ) 5. 59. 12,
(दिव्यरूपौ) 8. 57. 42; great (महेषुधी)
1. 216. 7; 5. 59. 12; 8. 57. 42; inexhaustible
(अक्षय्यौ) 1. 216. 7; (अक्षयौ) 5. 59.
12; 8. 57. 42; full of arrows (शरपूर्णौ)
5. 59. 12; Varuṇa gave them to Arjuna
at the time of burning the Khāṇḍava
forest (प्रादाद् वै … अक्षय्यौ च महेषुधी)
1. 216. 7; according to Karṇa, however, these
were given by Havyavāha (Agni) himself to
Arjuna (महेषुधी … हव्यवाहात्) 8. 57. 42.

वारुण
Vāruṇa4 adj.: of the conch Devadatta
2. 3. 7. [See Devadatta and Vāruṇa5]

वारुण
Vāruṇa5 adj.: of the conch of
Varuṇa (?).
Prajāpati in a previous age got it for
Indra; the ocean (कलशोदधि) brought it
for Yudhiṣṭhira for his anointment at the
Rājasūya (कलशोदधिः समुद्रः Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 2. 53. 15; however Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 2. 49. 26. कलश इव कलशो जलपूर्ण-
त्वात् समुद्रः। … अन्ये तु कलशोदधिः
समुद्रः); it was well-fashioned by
Viśvakarman and was set with a thousand
निष्कस् (सिक्तं निष्कसहस्रेण सुकृतं
विश्वकर्मणा); with this Vāruṇa conch
Kṛṣṇa anointed Yudhiṣṭhira 2. 49. 14-15;
however, according to 2. 45. 26-27 the ocean
(कलशोदधि) brought a Vāruṇa drinking
vessel made of brass (कांस्यं … वारु-
णं) to Yudhiṣṭhira; it was probably
brought in a sling made of a thousand
रुक्मस् and adorned with many jewels 2.
45. 26-27.

वारुणास्त्र
Vāruṇāstra, Vāruṇa astra nt.: Name
of the missile related to Varuṇa.
A. Description: heavenly (दिव्य) 5.
181. 13; 6. 116. 38; 7. 73. 46; 12. 5.
13-14; fierce (घोर) 7. 53. 43.
B.
Knowledge: (1) Droṇa knew the use of
the Vāruṇa astra 7. 166. 2; (2) Arjuna,
after reaching the residence of Indra, was to
learn the Astra from Varuṇa 3. 164. 29;
Arjuna told Uttara that he received the Vāruṇa
astra from Varuṇa 4. 56. 14; 7. 53. 43; 12. 5.
13-14; Vāruṇa astra included among the group
of missiles (अस्त्रग्रामः) known to Arjuna
5. 181. 11; according to Bhīṣma known only
to Arjuna, and perhaps to Kṛṣṇa 6. 116.
38-39; but it was apparently also known to
Rāma Jāmadagnya, Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Sātyaki,
Śikhaṇḍin, Yudhiṣṭhira (?) and Karṇa (see
the next section C);
C. Use: (1) In
the epic war: (i) by Droṇa: one of the
missiles used against Yudhiṣṭhira with the inte-
ntion of killing him (जिघांसुः) 7. 132. 29;
against Arjuna 7. 163. 28; (ii) by Arjuna:
used by Arjuna, according to prescriptions,
to repel the same (?) missile used by Droṇa
against him (मुक्तं मुक्तं द्रोणचापात्
तज् जघान धनंजयः॥अस्त्राण्य् अस्त्रैर्
यदा तस्य विधिवद् धन्ति पाण्डवः)
7. 163. 28-29; to protect Bhīma from the fire
of the Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 171. 1; (iii) Sātyaki
employed the Vāruṇa astra to pacify the
Āgneya astra, used by Droṇa (तद्
आग्नेयं महाघोरं रिपुघ्नम् उपलक्ष्य
सः।अस्त्रं दिव्यं महेष्वासो वारुणं
समुदैरयत् … अस्त्रे ते वारुणाग्नेये ताभ्-
यां बाणसमाहिते) 7. 73. 46, 48; (iv)
Śikhaṇḍin used it to repel a powerful missile
used agaisnt him by Śalya 6. 81. 25-27;
(v) Karṇa used this missile to extinguish the
fire caused by the Astra of Jātavedas
(Āgneyāstra) employed by Arjuna 8. 67. 10;
Arjuna nullified its effects by the Vāyavyāstra
8. 67. 11; (vi) Yudhiṣṭhira successfully
combated the different missiles-one of
them being Vāruṇa-used agaisnt him by
Droṇa by using the same (?) missiles
(तानि चास्त्राणि धर्मजः।जघानास्त्रैर्
महाबाहुः) 7. 132. 30. (2) Outside the
epic war: used by Rāma Jāmadagnya
against Bhīṣma to repulse his Āgneya
astra 5. 181. 12; (ii) Bhīṣma used this
missile against Śālva and with it crushed
the four horses of Śālva 1. 96. 37; against
Arjuna at the cattle-raid 4. 59. 21; (iii)
Arjuna used it against Bhīṣma on the same
occasion 4. 59. 21; Arjuna demonstrated it at
the time of showing his skill in the use of
missiles (अस्त्रलाघव) 1. 125. 18-19.
D.
Effects: (1) When Karṇa released the Vāruṇa
astra to pacify the fire of the Āgneyāstra, the
directions were covered with clouds and it
became dark (जीमूतैश्च दिशः सर्वाश् चक्रे
तिमिरदुर्दिनाः) 8. 67. 10; the clouds were
driven away by Arjuna by using the Vāyavyā-
stra 8. 67. 11; (2) when used by Arjuna to
cover Bhīma, who was surrounded by the
fire of the Nārāyaṇāstra (तेजसः प्रतिघा-
तार्थं वारुणेन समावृणोत्), Bhīma could
not be seen by others (नालक्षयत तं
कश्चिद् वारुणास्त्रेण संवृतम्) 7. 171.
1-2; when Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna went through
the fire produced by the Nārāyaṇāstra, it
did not burn them on account of the Vāruṇa
astra employed by Arjuna (as also due to
the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna) 7. 171.
12; (3) at the time of the display of the
use of missiles, Arjuna produced water by
using Vāruṇa astra (वारुणेनासृजद् पयः)
1. 125. 19; for its use to combat the missiles
of others see the section C. E. Status:
Inferior to the Pāśupata astra 13. 14. 127.

वासवी
Vāsavī adj. (f.): of the unfailing
(अमोघा) Śakti of Vāsava (Indra) 3. 294.

58; (3. 286. 20). [See Śakti]

विचक्र
Vicakra nt.: Name of the weapon
(शस्त्र 1. 218. 31) of Śiva.

विजय
Vijaya1 nt.: Name of the bow of Indra.
A. History: It was fashioned by
Viśvakarman for the use of Indra 8. 22. 36;

Jāmadagnya), and Rāma gave it to Karṇa
8. 22. 37-38, 40.
B. Description: Ancient
(पुरातन) 8. 45. 33; heavenly (दिव्य) 8.
22. 38, 46; large, larger than all weapons

honoured (परमसंमत) 8. 22. 37.
C. Use: (1) By Indra: Śatakratu (Indra)
conquered hosts of Daityas with it; due to
its sound the Daityas lost sense of directions
(यस्य घोषेण दैत्यानां विमुह्यन्ति
दिशो दश) 8. 22. 37; Rāma Jāmadagnya
narrated to Karṇa the divine acts (not
detailed) performed with Vijaya (by
Indra ?) 8. 22. 40; (2) By Rāma Jāma-
dagnya: Rāma conquered earth twentyone
times using Vijaya 8. 22. 39; (3) By Karṇa:
Karṇa wanted to use Vijaya while fighting
with Arjuna 8. 22. 38; Karṇa's desire for a
duel with Arjuna indicated by him by
stretching the bow-string of his Vijaya
(व्याक्षिपद् विजयं धनुः) 8. 42. 52;
Karṇa must have used it on other
occasions too; specific mention is found in
Karṇa's fight with Dhṛṣṭadyumna when,
while using, he shook it (विजयं तु धनुः-
श्रेष्ठं विधुन्वानः) 8. 42. 8; when
Duryodhana drew Karṇa's attention to the
rout of the Kaurava army, he strung
his Vijaya bow, wiped it (संमृज्य), and
discharged Bhārgavāstra from it 8. 45.
33-34.
D. Status: According to Karṇa
Vijaya was superior to Gāṇḍīva of Arjuna
(गाण्डीवात् तद् विशीष्यते) 8. 22. 39; 8. 22. 46.
[Apparently different from Vijaya2]

विजय
Vijaya2 nt.: Name of the bow of
Mahendra.
A. History: It belonged to Mahendra,

4-5; Rukmin, the son of Bhīṣmaka Hiraṇya-
loman, received this Vijaya bow from his
teacher Druma, the lion among the Kiṃpuruṣas
living on the Gandhamādana mountain 5. 155.

strength (तुल्यं गाण्डीवतेजसा) 5. 155. 4;
also comparable with Śārṅga bow of Viṣṇu
(शार्ङ्गेण च संमितम्) 5. 155. 4; Vijaya
was considered to be one of the three
heavenly bows of gods (the other two being
Gāṇḍiva of Varuṇa and Śārṅga of Viṣṇu) 5.
155. 5-6. [Apparently different from
Vijaya1]

विजय
Vijaya3 m.: Name of the trident (शूल)
of Rudra.
Present in the procession of Śiva to
Bhadravaṭa (after Skanda was anointed as
the सेनापति of the gods); in the procession,
Vijaya followed Yama; and Vijaya, in turn,
was followed by Varuṇa and his acquatic
creatures, as also by the पट्टिश of Rudra;

वैजयन्ती
Vaijayantī f. (du.): Name of the two
bells of Airāvata, the elephant of Indra.

one of the two bells was with Viśākha, the
other remained with Skanda 3. 220. 18-20.

वैष्णव
Vaiṣṇava1 adj.: of the Cakra belonging
to Viṣṇu.
In the world of Varuṇa, the Cakra,
permeated by smokeless fire, lay in his
lake (वरुणह्रदे।वैष्णवं चक्रम्
आविद्धम् विधूमेन हविष्मता) 5. 96. 18.
[See Sudarśana, Āgneyāstra]

वैष्णव
Vaiṣṇava2 adj.: of the bow Śārṅga

वैष्णवास्त्र
Vaiṣṇavāstra, Vaiṣṇava (astra): nt.
(sg.; pl. 3. 164. 30) Name of a missile
belonging to Viṣṇu (तद् अस्त्रं पार्थ
मामकम् 7. 28. 33).
A. History: In the bygone days, Earth
(पृथिवी, जगती, क्षमा) asked for her son
Naraka the following boon from the fourth
form of Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) which wakes up once
after thousand years: “May he be equipped
with the Vaiṣṇavāstra so that he cannot be
killed by the gods and the Asuras”; accord-
ingly Viṣṇu gave the missile to Naraka and
said: “May this missile be unfailing in
protecting Naraka; no one shall kill him;
protected by the missile, Naraka will be
unassailable in the worlds for all times”;
from Naraka, the missile went to Prāgjyotiṣa
(Bhagadatta) 7. 28. 26-33.
B. Descrip-
tion: heavenly (दिव्य) 6. 116. 38; great
missile (परमास्त्र) 7. 28. 34; unfailing
(अमोघ) 7. 28. 29, 30; killer of all
(सर्वघातक) 7. 28. 17.
C. Know-
ledge: Indra told Arjuna to go to his residence
in the heaven to learn all the Vaiṣṇava
missiles (वैष्णवानि च सर्वाणि) together
with other heavenly missiles 3. 164. 29-30;
according to Bhīṣma, all the heavenly missiles
including the Vaiṣṇava astra, known to
Arjuna and perhaps to Kṛṣṇa, and to no one
else in the world of the mortals (सर्वस्मिन्
मानुषे लोके वेत्त्य् एको हि धनंजयः।
कृष्णो वा देवकीपुत्रो नान्यो वै वेद
कश्चन) 6. 116. 38-39.
D. Use in
the epic war: Bhagadatta, wishing to
release the Vaiṣṇavāstra (उदीरयन्) recited
मन्त्रस् (अभिमन्त्र्य) on his hook
(अङ्कुश) and hurled it aiming it on Arjuna's
chest; Kṛṣṇa covered Arjuna and received the
missile on his chest, where it turned into the
garland Vaijayantī 7. 28. 16-18; since there
was no one in the worlds, including even Indra
and Rudra, who could not be killed by the
missile, Kṛṣṇa covered Arjuna to save him
(नास्यावध्यो ऽस्ति लोकेषु सेन्द्ररुद्रेषु
मारिष) 7. 28. 33-34.

व्याल
Vyāla m.: Name (?) of a particular
kind of the arrangement of army (व्यूह).
On the fourth day of the war the Kau-
ravas arranged their army according to this
Vyūha; Bhīṣma led it, and he was followed
all around by Droṇa, Duryodhana, Bāhlika
(Somadatta), Durmarṣaṇa, Citrasena, Jayad-
ratha and other kings with their armies;
the Kaurava army looked like the sky full
of clouds at the advent of the rainy season;
that army, protected by Bhīṣma, rushed
towards Arjuna like a mighty current of a
river; its great strength lay concealed in
various ways and it had a large number of
elephants, horses, foot-soldiers and chariots
on either side (तं व्यालनानाविधगू-
ढसारां गजाश्वपादातरथौघपक्षम्।
व्यूहम् … ॥ Nī. व्यालो व्यूहविशेषस् तेन
नानाविधं गूढसारं च on Bom. Ed.
6. 60. 7) 6. 56. 1-7; it appears that this
Vyūha was opposed by the Pāṇḍavas with
their Ardhacandravyūha (not directly
mentioned) which they had adopted on the
previous day and in which the Pāñcāla and
the Cedi chiefs took their positions as before
(यथा हि पूर्वे ऽहनि धर्मराज्ञा व्यूहः
कृतः कौरवनन्दनेन।तथा तथोद्देशम्
उपेत्य तस्थुः पाञ्चालमुख्यैः सह
चेदिमुख्याः) 6. 56. 11.

व्यूह
Vyūha m.: A particular way of arrang-
ing the army for war; most of the Vyūhas
used by the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas are
named (Ardhacandra, Krauñca, Garuḍa,
Cakra, Cakraśakaṭa, Candrārdha, Padma,
Parānīkabhid (?), Bārhaspatya, Makara,
Maṇḍala, Maṇḍalārdha, Mahāvyūha, Vajra,
Vyāla (?), Śakaṭa (= Cakraśakaṭa), Śṛṅgāṭaka,
Śyena, Sarvatobhadra and Sūcī).
Some of the Vyūhas used by the two
sides on certain days are neither described
in detail nor named; on the other hand,
details of those used by the two sides on the
tenth day of the war are available, but they
are not named. (1) The Vyūha used by
the Pāṇḍavas: Described as overpowering
all the foes (सर्वशत्रुनिबर्हण) 6. 104.
4; Śikhaṇḍin was in the front of the entire
army (सर्वसैन्यानाम् अग्र आसीत्); Bhīma-
sena and Dhanaṃjaya acted as the protectors
of his wheel (चक्ररक्षौ); behind them
marched the sons of Draupadī and Abhi-
manyu, Sātyaki and Cekitāna; Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
guarded all around by the Pāñcāla army,
acted as their protector; behind them was
Yudhiṣṭhira with Nakula and Sahadeva;
behind them moved Virāṭa surrounded by
his own army, and he was followed by
Drupada; the five Kekaya brothers and
Dhṛṣṭaketu guarded the rear (जघनं
पालयाम् आस) 6. 104. 3-10; this Vyūha
could be one of the Mānuṣa, Daiva,
Gāndharva or Āsura Vyūhas known to
Dhṛṣṭadyumna 5. 56. 11; (2) The counter-
Vyūha of the Kauravas used on that day:
the entire Kaurava army was led by Bhīṣma
(अग्रटः सर्वसैन्यानाम्); he was guarded
by the sons of Dhṛṭarāṣṭra; they were
followed by Droṇa and his son Aśvatthāman;
Bhagadatta, with his army of elephants,
followed them; Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman followed
Bhagadatta; next came Sudakṣiṇa, the king
of the Kāmbojas, Jayatsena, the king of the
Magadhas, and Bṛhadbala, the son of Subala;
other kings headed by Suśarman guarded
the rear (जघनं पालयाम् आसुः)
6. 104. 15; similarly, during the war
at night (between the fourteenth and
the fifteenth day), the Kaurava army
was rearranged (पुनर् व्यूहम् अकल्-
पयत् 7. 138. 10) by Duryodhana (?, by
Droṇa ?); this Vyūha is also not named;
Droṇa was in the front, Aśvatthāman and
Śakuni on either side, and Śalya in the rear;
Duryodhana himself protected all the wings
of the army 7. 138. 11; this Vyūha in which
the chariots, horses, and elephants took up
their positions looked like (the armies in)
the Vyūha of the gods and the demons
7. 138. 32.

शकटव्यूह
Śakaṭavyūha m.: Name of a व्यूह
(a particular arrangement of the army)
7. 6. 15.
Droṇa arranged the Kaurava army in the
form of the Śakaṭavyūha on the eleventh day
of the war; Jayadratha, the Kaliṅga king (not
named), and Vikarṇa stood on the right side
(दक्षिण पार्श्व); at the extremity of the
right wing (प्रपक्ष) was Śakuni, assisted
by excellent horsemen from the Gandhāra
country who fought with sharp प्रासस्; Kṛpa,
Kṛtavarman, Citrasena, and Viviṃśati, with
Duḥśāsana to lead them (दुःशासनमुखाः),
stood on its left side (सव्य पार्श्व); at the
extremity of the left wing (प्रपक्ष) stood
the Kāmbojas, led by Sudakṣiṇa, who fought
on horses, as also the Śakas and the Yavanas;
apparently in between the two sides were
stationed the Madras, the Trigartas, the
Ambaṣṭhas, warriors who came from the west
and the north, the Śibis, the Śūrasenas, the
Śūdras, the Maladas, the Sauvīras, and the
Kitavas, all of whom were led by Duryo-
dhana (तवात्मजं पुरस्कृत्य); Karṇa
took position in front of Duryodhana
and was at the head of all the archers
(प्रमुखे सर्वधन्विनाम्) 7. 6. 1-8;
in this Vyūha, Karṇa was in front of the army
(तावकानां मुखं कर्णः) 7. 6. 21;
from the description of the start of that
day's battle it is clear that Droṇa also stood
at the head of the army 7. 6. 32-36; this
Vyūha of the Kauravas was opposed by the
Pāṇḍavas with the Krauñcavyūha 7. 6. 15.
[See Cakraśakaṭa]

शक्ति
Śakti1 f.: A missile special to Vāsava
(Indra), hence called वासवी 3. 294. 34;
7. 122. 33; 7. 148. 34; 7. 158. 9, 10, 56,
58; given by Vāsava 3. 286. 20; 7. 154. 50;
7. 155. 21; or by Śakra (Indra) 3. 294. 1ff.;
7. 154. 53, 58 (शक्रशक्ति); 7. 155. 27;
1. 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. 4.
A. Description: unfailing (अमोघा)
3. 286. 14; 3. 294. 20, 21, 24, 29, 33; 7. 157.
7, 12, 16, 29; heavenly (दिव्या) 8. 5. 65;
best, excellent (श्रेष्ठा) 7. 154. 52;
(उत्तमा) 7. 154. 55; (परमा) 7. 157. 6;
(प्रवरा) 3. 294. 29; honoured (सत्कृता) 7.
154. 53; (पूज्यमाना) 7. 122. 33; irresisti-
ble (अनिवार्या) 7. 158. 2; unbearable (असह्या)
7. 154. 52; 7. 158. 2; burning, shining (like a
lightning) (प्रज्वलन्ती) 7. 122. 33; (ज्व-
लन्ती) 7. 154. 57; (प्रज्वलिता) 3. 294. 35;
(प्रदीप्ता) 7. 154. 54; दीप्यमाना 7. 148. 34;
7. 154. 57; (विद्युत्प्रभा) 8. 5. 65; deco-
rated with gold (कनकभूषणा) 8. 5. 65;
victorious (वैजयन्ती) 7. 154. 52; the
highway to victory (जयस्य च परायणम्)
7. 157. 6; killer of one opponent (when used
by Karṇa) (एकघ्नी) 7. 158. 2; destroyer of
the body of the enemy (परकायापहन्त्री)
7. 154. 55; killer of many enemies (when
used by Indra) (द्विषतां हन्त्री)
8. 5. 65; (अमित्रविनिबर्हिणी) 3. 286. 14;
(शत्रुसङ्घानां घातिनीम्) 3. 294. 21;
having a terrible form (रौद्ररूपं
बिभर्ति च) 7. 148. 34.
B. Exchanged
by Indra for Karṇa's armour and ear-rings:
God Sūrya advised Karṇa to obtain from
Indra his unfailing Śakti in exchange for
(नियमेन) the armour (कवच) and
the ear-rings (कुण्डलस्) which Indra
would ask Karṇa to part with 3. 286.
14-15; after receiving this hint, Karṇa long-
ing for the Śakti waited for Vāsava (Indra)
3. 286. 20; when Indra came and begged
Karṇa of his कवच and कुण्डलस्, Karṇa
asked Indra's unfailing Śakti in return 3. 294.
20-21; Indra agreed to part with his Śakti
under the stipulation that although the Śakti,
when used by Indra, would unfailingly kill
Indra's enemies ब्य् हुन्द्रेद्स् and return to
Indra's (user's) hand, when it reached Karṇa
it would kill only ओने illustrious, roaring and
tormenting enemy of Karṇa and return, not to
Karṇa, but to Indra (सेयं तव करं प्रा-
प्य हत्वैकं रिपुम् ऊर्जितम्।गर्जन्तं
प्रतपन्तं च माम् एवैष्यति सूतज॥)
3. 294. 23-25; the Śakti, as long as it was
with Karṇa, would fail after killing one hero
and would lose its quality of being unfailing
(एकवीरवधे मोघा) 7. 157. 1, 7; (अमो-
घाया विघातार्थम्) 7. 157. 12; Karṇa
agreed to receive the Śakti on that condition
for he feared danger in battle only from one
enemy 3. 294. 26, 29; Indra also warned
Karṇa not to use the Śakti when other missiles
were available with him and when he was
not in danger; if used negligently the
Śakti would boomerang on Karṇa (विद्य-
मानेषु शस्त्रेषु यद्य् अमोघाम् असंशये।
प्रमत्तो मोक्ष्यसे चापि त्वय्येवैषा
पतिष्यति॥) 3. 294. 33; Karṇa vowed to
Indra (सत्यम् एतद् ब्रवीमि ते) that
he would release the Vāsavī (Śakti) only
when he was in great danger 3. 294. 34;
Karṇa then received the burning Sakti in
exchange of his कवच and कुण्डलस् 3. 294.
35, 38; 8. 5. 65.
C. What the Śakti meant
to Karṇa: Karṇa had great confidence due to
the Śakti (अयं च प्रत्ययः कर्णे शक्त्या)
7. 157. 31; when Vāsava (Indra) gave the
Śakti to Karṇa, he (Karṇa) felt that Arjuna
was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with
Śakti in Karṇa's hand, no one in the world
dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karṇa had
preserved the Śakti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33;
7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the Śakti meant
death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duḥśāsana,
Śakuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always
counselled Karṇa not to use the Śakti against
any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf.
7. 157. 19-21 for the use of Śakti (not named)
only against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa); if on any
occasion Karṇa's other missiles had failed and
if he was pressed (पीडितः) by the circums-
tances, he would certainly have used his
Vāsavī Śakti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54;
hence Kṛṣṇa protected Arjuna particularly
from the unfailing Śakti which, if released,
would certainly have killed him like the light-
ning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16;
according to Vyāsa too if Arjuna and
Karṇa had clashed, the latter, after exhaus-
ting all other missiles, would have surely
used Vāsavī against Arjuna 7. 158. 56;
Kṛṣṇa was therefore always looking for a
way to render the unfailing Śakti futile
(अमोघां तां कथं शक्तिं मोघां
कुर्याम्) 7. 157. 29; when the Śakti was
diverted on Ghaṭotkaca, Karṇa, in the
opinion of Kṛṣṇa, was as good as dead
7. 155. 12; when Karṇa was relieved
of his Śakti, he became an ordinary
human being (सो ऽद्य मानुषतां
प्राप्तो विमुक्तः शक्रदत्तया 7. 155. 27),
and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33.
D. Why the Śakti was not used against
Arjuna: Both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sātyaki asked
Saṃjaya and Kṛṣṇa respectively why the Śakti
was not used by Karṇa against Arjuna 7.
157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) accor-
ding to Saṃjaya's reporting, Duryodhana,
Śakuni, Duḥśāsana, and he himself urged
Karṇa every night after the day's war to use
his Śakti the next day against Arjuna or
Kṛṣṇa (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was
forgotten the next day during the fight due
to the watchfulness of Kṛṣṇa (सा तु बुद्धिः
कृताप्य् एवं जाग्रति त्रिदशेश्वरे।अप्रमेये
हृषीकेशे युद्धकाले व्यमुह्यत) 7. 157. 27;
Kṛṣṇa also never brought Arjuna face to face
with Karṇa as long as the latter was equipped
with Śakti; Kṛṣṇa managed to see that
other warriors faced Karṇa 7. 157. 28-29;
according to Saṃjaya, again, the previous
night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten
by Karṇa the next day due to the deities
(unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes
(on the side of the Kauravas), and thus
it was primarily due to the working of the
fate that Karṇa did not employ his Śakti
against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa to kill any one of
them (ततः प्रभातसमये राजन् कर्णस्य
दैवतैः।अन्येषां चैव योधानां सा
बुद्धिर् नश्यते पुनः॥दैवम् एव परं
मन्ये यत् कर्णो हस्तसंस्थया।न
जघान रणे पार्थं कृष्णं वा देवकी-
सुतम्॥ 7. 158. 6-7; also 8-9; (2) accor-
ding to Vyāsa too it was due to fate
(दिष्ट्या) that Arjuna was not locked in
a duel with Karṇa prior to the latter's being
relieved of the Śakti 7. 158. 54; according
to him Ghaṭotkaca was killed by Time
using Vāsavī as his means (वासवीं
कारणं कृत्वा कालेनापहतो ह्य् असौ)
7. 158. 58; (3) according to Kṛṣṇa he
deluded the mind of Karṇa and hence he did
not use his Śakti against Arjuna (अहम्
एव तु राधेयं मोहयामि युधां वर
7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
both fate and the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa
came together to defeat the purpose of the
Kauravas and hence the Vāsavī (Śakti)
killed Ghaṭotkaca instead of Arjuna
(दैवेनैव हता यूयं स्वबुद्ध्या
केशवस्य च।गता हि वासवी हत्वा
तृणभूतं घटोत्कचम्) 7. 158. 10.
E. Use: (1) By Karṇa: All the Kuru
warriors urged Karṇa to kill the demon
Ghaṭotkaca by using the Śakti given to him
by Vāsava and save the Kauravas and their
warriors from destruction; hearing that call,
Karṇa held the Śakti desiring to kill Ghaṭot-
kaca, that Śakti given to him by Śakra
and which he had preserved for Arjuna
for years; when the missile was released,
Ghaṭotkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form
of the foot of the Vindhya mountain and
fled; the beings in the mid-region wailed
at the sight of the Śakti; the released Śakti
first burnt the माया of Ghaṭotkaca, and
then broke open deeply the chest of Ghaṭot-
kaca and went up in the sky, shining at night,
to enter the spaces between the नक्षत्रस्
(ऊर्ध्वं ययौ दीप्यमाना निशायां
नक्षत्राणाम् अन्तराण्य् आविशन्ती 7. 154. 57);
Ghaṭotkaca, with his vitals pierced by the
Śakti, was killed 7. 154. 48-59; 7. 156. 24;
7. 158. 10; 8. 5. 71; by asking Ghaṭotkaca
to fight with Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa diverted the Śakti
on him 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. (5), 6, 39;
7. 155. 12, 14; (Kṛṣṇa said that if
Karṇa had not killed Ghaṭotkaca with his
Śakti, he would have killed Ghaṭotkaca
7. 156. 25); (2) By Indra: When used
by Indra while fighting with the Daityas,
the Śakti, after killing his enemies by hun-
dreds, returned to Indra's hand 3. 294. 24;
3. 286. 16 (killing of the enemies by
hundreds and thousands). [See Śakti2-5]

imbibing it with his own lustre (आदधच्
चात्मनो तेजः 9. 45. 60); when released, the
flame of the meteor and resounding thunder-
bolts struck the earth as would happen at the
time of the end of the world; when one
Śakti was hurled by Skanda, crores of Śaktis
fell out from it; Skanda killed with his
missile the demons Tāraka, Mahiṣa, Tripāda

against Śālva from his heavenly bow 3. 21.
24; the arrows released from Śārṅga pierced
the bodies of the demons in the Saubhapura
and they fell down in the ocean 3. 21. 28;
due to the माया of Śālva, Kṛṣṇa saw the
son of Śūra (Vasudeva) falling down from
the Saubha; as a result, he was confused and
the Śārṅga slipped down from his hand 3.

from it which cut off the heads of the
enemies 3. 23. 1-2.

after the death of Droṇa, that when on the
battle-field he shot arrows at his enemies he
saw an excellent person (पुरुषोत्तम) of
fiery lustre, looking like the sun, moving in
front of him with his raised burning Śūla; the
person did not touch the ground with his feet
and never released the Śula, but thousands of
Śūlas fell out from it; the direction in which
the excellent person moved, Arjuna's enemies
were destroyed; thus, actually the excellent
person first burnt Arjuna's enemies and Arjuna
burnt them afterwards, but people thought
Arjuna did it; Vyāsa told Arjuna that the
excellent person was none else but Śaṅkara
with his Śūla 7. 173. 3-10.

ed दण्डनीति, is described as one having the

(चक्र) which is superior to Śūla (शूलाद्
वरं श्रेष्ठं चक्रम् आयुधं यस्य, see
Cr. edn. 12. 122. 24 f. n.); Viṣṇu is also called
there शूल (जटा) धर 12. 122. 24; Bhīṣma,
while praising Kṛṣṇa as the highest god, uses

of them being that the weapon of the
Sādhyas clashed with that of the Vasus, the
Rudras, the Ādityas, the Maruts and the
other hosts of gods (ये चान्ये देवतागणाः);
such a thing had never happened before 1.
26. 29-30. [See Sādhya astra]

सावित्र
Sāvitra (astra) nt.: Name of a
missile of Savitṛ.
Described as heavenly (दिव्य) 6. 116.
38; Droṇa employed it (as also other
missiles) against Yudhiṣṭhira in order to
kill him (जिघांसुः) 7. 132. 29; Yudhiṣṭhira
defeated it by the use of the same (?)
missile (तानि चास्त्राणि धर्मजः।जघाना-
स्त्रैर् महाबाहुः कुम्भयोनेर् अवित्रसन्)
7. 132. 30; however, according to Bhīṣma,
among men, the use of this missile (सवितुर्

perhaps to Kṛṣṇa, and to none else (नान्यो
वै वेद कश्चन) 6. 116. 38-39.

before the start of the war on the next day
6. 47. 26, (and very likely on all the following
days).

सुदर्शन
Sudarśana cakra nt.: Name of the
discuss used as a missile (अस्त्र 1. 216. 28;
10. 12. 15, 16, 18) by Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu
वैष्णवम् चक्रं 5. 96. 18), often referred
to simply as Cakra; called Āgneya astra 1.
216. 21; 3. 23. 28; 7. 10. 21.
A. History: Fire in high flames,
permeated by smokeless fire, remains awake
in the form of Viṣṇu's cakra (वैष्णवं
चक्रम्) in Varuṇa's lake 5. 96. 18; at the
time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest, god
Agni asked Varuṇa to give for his sake the
Cakra to Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) with which he
would execute a great deed (cf. also 16. 4. 3);
Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request (1. 216. 4)
and gave the Cakra, here called Āgneya
astra, to Kṛṣṇa; Agni told Kṛṣṇa that,
equipped with the Cakra, he would defeat
even superhuman beings in battle; he would
be superior to men, gods, demons, Piśācas,
Daityas and serpents when in battle he
was opposed by a very strong enemy; when-
ever Kṛṣṇa hurled in battle the Cakra
against his enemies, it would kill the enemy
without resistance and return to Kṛṣṇa's hand
1. 216. 21-24; Kṛṣṇa felt fully prepared to
fight with all the gods and demons when he
received the Cakra 1. 216. 26-27, 30, 21;
Arjuna felt confident that there was nothing
which Kṛṣṇa would not conquer when he had
the Cakra for use in battle 1. 216. 28;
according to the information of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Kṛṣṇa received the Cakra, identified with the
Āgneya astra, from the satisfied Agni after,
and not before, the burning of the forest 7.

C. Kṛṣṇa's missile:
Kṛṣṇa's different weapons, Cakra one of
them, appeared on his arms when he showed
his fierce form to the Kauravas in their

Cakra rotates due to his माया resorting to
the space between the sky and (the earth ?)
as directed by him (द्याम् अन्तरं समा-
स्थाय यथायुक्तं मनस्विनः।चक्रं

66. 2; Kṛṣṇa asked Sātyaki to place, among
other things, his Cakra in the chariot when he
was to proceed to Hāstinapura 5. 81. 12;
Yudhiṣṭhira saw Govinda (Kṛṣṇa) in heaven
together with his heavenly missiles, the Cakra
and the rest, in the bodily form (चक्र-
प्रभृतिभिः … पुरुषविग्रहैः) 18. 4. 3.
D. Use of Cakra in epithets: Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu)

E. Aśvatthāman incident:
Aśvatthāman was forbidden to use the
Brahmaśiras astra on any occasion whatso-
ever; so he wanted to exchange Brahmaśiras
for Kṛṣṇa's Sudarśana; Kṛṣṇa allowed Aśva-
tthāman to choose any one of his missiles,
including the Cakra, which he felt he could
wield and use in the battle; Aśvatthāman opted
for the Cakra, and when allowed by Kṛṣṇa
to take it, he first tried to pick it up with his
left hand; failing to move it, he tried his right
hand; when he could not move the Cakra
even with his right hand, he used all his might
(i. e. probably used both his hands together);
having failed in this attempt too, Aśvatthāman
in despair abandoned the attempt; Kṛṣṇa then
told him that he had asked for something very
unusual, for not even Arjuna, Pradyumna,
(Bala)rāma, Gada, Sāmba, nor any one of
the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes living in
Dvārakā had asked for it; Kṛṣṇa, out of
curiosity, asked Aśvatthāman whom he wanted
to fight with equipped with Sudarśana; Aśva-
tthāman admitted that he wanted to fight
with Kṛṣṇa himself and become invincible;
Aśvatthāman realised that the Cakra would
not leave Kṛṣṇa and hence he left Dvārakā
without it 10. 12. 14-38.
F. Its use:
(1) In wars or events not related to the
epic: (i) when Viṣṇu was distributing the
अमृत among the gods, Rāhu cunningly
managed to get it; as the अमृत had
reached Rāhu's throat, Viṣṇu used the Cakra
to cut off his head; when severed by the
Cakra, the head fell on the ground and shook
the earth 1. 17. 5-7; (ii) in the war that
ensued between the gods and the demons
after the above incident Nara and Nārāyaṇa
appeared on the scene; Viṣṇu (Narāyaṇa)
then thought of his Sudarśana cakra; as soon
as thought of, it arrived from the sky (ततो
ऽम्बराच् चिन्तितमात्रम् आगतम् 1. 17. 20);
armed with it, Viṣṇu used it against the
demons; it struck them again and again and
cut off the Daityas to pieces in thousands;
sometimes it licked the Dānavas and, over-
powering them, cut them off; sometimes it
burnt them like fire; hurled now in the sky
and then on the ground it drunk their blood
like a Piśāca; having heard that the Sudar-
śana cakra was angry, the demons disappeared
entering the earth and the ocean 1. 17. 18-28;
(iii) in Kṛṣṇa's war with Śālva who was
fighting from his Saubhapura, Kṛṣṇa released
his sharp-edged discuss, here called his dear
(दयित) Āgneya astra (3. 23. 28), after
reciting मन्त्रस् over it (अभिमन्त्र्य 3.
23. 30) and using the strength of his arm
(भुजवीर्येण 3. 23. 31); Kṛṣṇa directed
his Cakra to strike down with its might the
Saubha and all the enemies living there; the
missile cut into two the Saubha town in the
middle as a saw might cut a pillar; after
achieving its objective the missile returned to
Kṛṣṇa's hand; Kṛṣṇa again shook it upwards
with great speed and released it with the
words: “(now) for Śālva” (पुनश् चोद्-
धूय वेगेन शाल्वायेत्य् अहम् अब्रुवम् 3. 23.
35); the discuss instantly cut Śālva into two,
who was then wielding a heavy गदा, and
then it blazed with its lustre 3. 23. 28-36;
(2) In wars or events related to the epic:
(1) at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire, Kṛṣṇa
killed many hosts of Daityas and Dānavas
with his Cakra; many others, were blown
away by the speed of the Cakra (चक्र-
वेगेरिताः) 1. 218. 26-27; in this incident
Kṛṣṇa released his Cakra on animals and
other beings (तथान्या भूतजातयः 1. 219.
2) so that these, along with the Dānavas and
the night-stalkers (सदानवनिशाचराः 1. 219.
4) were cut into pieces by hundreds and they
fell into the fire; the Rākṣasas, cut by the
Cakra of Kṛṣṇa, looked like evening clouds;
Kṛṣṇa moved there like the god of Death kill-
ing by thousands Piśācas, birds, serpents and
animals with his Cakra; the Cakra, repeatedly
hurled, killed many beings and returned to
Kṛṣṇa's hand 1. 219. 2-7; if the Rākṣasas,
Dānavas and serpents tried to escape to-
gether (एकायनगताः सङ्घीभूताः Nī. on
1. 228. 34 Bom. Ed.) even then Kṛṣṇa killed
them and they fell into the flaming fire 1. 219.
30-31; Kṛṣṇa saw Asura Maya fleeing from
the house of Takṣaka and when Agni showed
his desire to burn him, Kṛṣṇa stood ready with
his raised Cakra to kill him; but Maya sought
help from Arjuna and was saved 1. 219.
35-39; (2) Enraged Kṛṣṇa cut off the head
of Śiśupāla with Cakra at the time of the
Rājasūya 2. 42. 21; 3. 15. 3-4; 12-13 (use
of Cakra not mentioned).
G. Threatened
or eventual use in the epic war: (1) Dis-
appointed at Arjuna's softness (मृदुयुद्ध-
ताम् 6. 55. 63, 80) while fighting with Bhīṣma,
Kṛṣṇa took up his discuss (रथाङ्गम्) with
a view to killing Bhīṣma; raising his Cakra he
jumped down from the chariot and proceeded
on foot to attack Bhīṣma; the Sudarśana,
lotus-like and having a beautiful nave, shone
like the primeval lotus (आदिपद्म) rising
from the navel of Nārāyaṇa; seeing Kṛṣṇa
equipped with Cakra all beings cried aloud
thinking that that was the end of the Kurus;
Kṛṣṇa, holding the Cakra and jumping along,
looked as if he was revolving the world, or
he looked like the god of Death in the form of
Fire burning the creatures (संवर्तयिष्यन्न्
इव जीवलोकम्। … भूतानि धक्ष्यन्न् इव
कालवह्निः) 6. 55. 92); (2) seeing Kṛṣṇa
rushing towards him with Cakra in hand,
Bhīṣma invited him from his chariot to put
an end to his life; when Arjuna, coming
from behind, assured Kṛṣṇa that he would
destroy the Kurus, Kṛṣṇa returned and holding
the discuss, mounted the chariot 6. 55. 83,
86-87, 89-94, 100-101; (3) Apprehending
that Arjuna might not be able to fulfil his vow
to kill Jayadratha before sunset, Kṛṣṇa thought
that his intervention in the war might become
necessary and he therefore asked Dāruka, his
charioteer, to keep his chariot ready with all
the missiles in it, including Cakra, so that he
would destroy the enemy's army with it 7.
56. 32, 28. (4) Kṛṣṇa, in order to incite
Arjuna who was somewhat overpowered
by Karṇa, showed readiness to give his
Cakra to him to cut off Karṇa's head with
it 8. 65. 19.
H. Actual or possible defeat
of Sudarśana: (1) Viṣṇu's Cakra was
shattered on the limbs of Mandara, the son
of Hiraṇyakaśipu, owing to a boon Mandara
had received from Mahādeva (Śiva) 13. 14.
54; (2) even Kṛṣṇa with his Sudarśana
would not be able to vanquish Karṇa as long
as he was armed with Indra's (वासवी)
Śakti and was protected by his armour and
कुण्डलस् 7. 155. 17, (13-15).
I. End
When the end of the Yādavas had arrived and
when they started for the तीर्थयात्रा on the
shore of the ocean, the Cakra, given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agni, left him and rose to the sky
even as the Vṛṣṇis watched it 16. 4. 3; when
Yudhiṣṭhira relinquished the kingdom to
Parikṣit and the Pāṇḍavas started for the
forest, god Agni appeared in bodily form
(17. 1. 33) and told them that the excellent
Cakra which stayed with Kṛṣṇa had dis-
appeared and that it would return to his hand
at the proper time (चक्ररत्नं तु यत्
कृष्णे स्थितम् आसीन् महात्मनि।गतं तच्
च पुनर् हस्ते कालेनैष्यति तस्य ह॥)
17. 1. 38.

सुदर्शन
Sudarśana2 nt.: Name of Indra's aerial
car (विमान 4. 51. 7).
Śakra (Indra), with many other gods,
came to watch the war between Arjuna and
the Kaurava heroes at the time of the
cattle-raid riding his Sudarśana Vimāna 4.
51. 3.

सुपर्ण
Suparṇa m.: Name of a Vyūha (7. 19.
4-5). [See Garuḍa]

सूची
Sūcī (Sūcī̆°) f.: Name of a particular
arrangement of the army (व्यूह).
A. When to be used: According to
the great sage Bṛhaspati if the number
of warriors in one's army was small it
should be gathered together, but if it was
large it might be spread out as much as
desired; in the former case the contingent in
the front should be arranged according to the
Sūcī vyūha (महर्षेर् वचनात् तात वेद-
यन्ति बृहस्पतेः।संहतान् योधयेद् अल्पान्
कामं विस्तारयेद् बहून्॥सूचीमुखम्
अनीकं स्याद् अल्पानां बहुभिः सह।) 6.
19. 4-5; 12. 101. 44.
B. Its use in the
epic war: (1) In the opinion of Yudhiṣṭhira,
since the Pāṇḍava army was smaller in
number than that of their opponent, it was to
be arranged as directed by the great sage
(Bṛhaspati); this was his suggestion to
Arjuna at the beginning of the war
on the first day (अस्माकं च तथा सैन्यम्
अल्पीयः सुतरां परैः॥एतद् वचनम्
आज्ञाय महर्षेर् व्यूह पाण्डव) 6. 19.
5-6; (Arjuna, however, chose to arrange the
Pāṇḍava army according to the Vajravyūha 6.
19. 7); (2) When the contingent compris-
ing the Kekaya princess the sons of Draupadī,
and Dhṛṣṭaketu and which was led by Abhi-
manyu with a large force was asked by
Yudhiṣṭhira to rush to the aid of Bhīmasena
and Dhṛṣṭadyumna, they arranged themselves
in such a way that its front formed the
Sūcī 6. 73. 51, 54-55; (3) In order to
protect Jayadratha a small contingent was
arranged in the form of Sūcī which was
concealed in the middle of the Padma vyūha,
which itself formed the rear half of the main
Śakaṭa (7. 53. 27) or the Cakraśakaṭa vyūha
7. 63. 21; 7. 63. 23; the front of the Sūcī
(सूचीमुख) was formed by Kṛtavarman,
followed by Jalasandha, the Kāmboja;
Duryodhana with his Amātyas stood behind
them; behind them, at the position of the
‘eye’ of the Sūci (? सूचिपाश 7. 63. 27),
stood Jayadratha surrounded by a large force
7. 63. 24-27; 7. 53. 27; a hundred thousand
warriors who would not turn away from the
battle-field were distributed in the Śakaṭa
vyūha to guard the Sūci vyūha (योधानाम्
अनिवर्तिनाम्।व्यवस्थितानि सर्वाणि शकटे
सूचिरक्षिणः) 7. 63. 26.

सृत
Sṛta nt.: One of the twenty-one move-
ments (मार्ग) used while fighting with a
sword and a shield.
Dhṛṣṭadyumna used it when he, with a
sword and a shield in hand, wanted to avoid
the arrows of Droṇa and also attack him
(सो ऽचरद् विविधान् मार्गान् प्रकारान्
एकविंशतिम्) 7. 164. 145-148.

सौपर्ण
Sauparṇa astra nt.: Name of a
missile.
It was used (प्रादुष्कृ) by Suśarman
to free the feet of his army which were tied
up by the snakes released by the Nāga astra
of Arjuna; from the Sauparṇa astra came out
the Suparṇas which started eating up the
snakes; then the snakes, seeing those birds,
crept away and the army was freed from the
ties on their feet 8. 37. 25-27; 21-22.

सौम्य
Saumya astra nt.: Name of a missile
related to Soma.
Described as heavenly (दिव्य) 6. 116.
38; used by Arjuna against the Gandharvas,
who had captured the Kauravas, to ward off
the showers of arrows released by them; the
Gandharvas felt burnt by the arrows (दह्य-
मानाः) of Arjuna 3. 234. 17-18; according
to Bhīṣma's information, only Arjuna, among
men, knew this missile, and perhaps Kṛṣṇa
6. 116. 38-39.

सौर
Saura astra nt.: Name of a missile
related to Sūra.
Used by Arjuna against the Gandharvas,
who had captured the Kauravas, to ward off
the showers of arrows released by them; the
Gandharvas felt burnt by the arrows (दह्य-
मानाः) of Arjuna 3. 234. 17-18; [See
Bhāskara astra].

स्थूणाकर्ण
Sthūṇākarṇa nt.: Name of a missile,
apparently known to very few heroes.
According to Nīlakaṇṭha, it is related
to Śaṅkukarṇa, one of the incarnations of
Rudra (स्थूणाकर्ण इति शङ्कुकर्णाख्यो
रुद्रावतारभेदस् तद्दैवत्यम् अस्त्रम् on
3. 167. 33 Bom. Ed.); it seems to have been
a very important missile since it is mentioned
along with the Pāśupata and the Brahmāstra
5. 47. 100; 5. 139. 31 (also Aindra); Arjuna,
in his message sent through Saṃjaya,
threatened to use Sthūṇākarṇa against the
Kaurava warriors in the war 5. 47. 100;
Karṇa, too, was sure that Arjuna would use
Sthūṇākarṇa in the war with the employment
of proper मन्त्रस् on his arrow (मन्त्रास्
तत्र भविष्यन्ति प्रयुक्ताः सव्यसाचिना) 5.
139. 31; but its use by Arjuna in the war is
not recorded; on the other hand Karṇa him-
self, while inciting the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
who were attacking Yudhiṣṭhira to kill him,
released Sthūṇākarṇa, along with Indrajāla
and Pāśupata, to overpower Yudhiṣṭhira 8.
43. 20-21; outside the epic war, Arjuna used
it against the Kirāta (Śiva) who swallowed it
up 3. 163. 32; Arjuna used it also against
the Gandharvas who had captured the
Kauravas; the Gandharvas were tormented
by the heat (दह्यमानाः) of the arrows
released by the use of the missile 3. 234.

missile to repulse a very powerful गदा
hurled against him and Kṛṣṇa by Jarāsandha;
the गदा, when met with force by the missile,
fell on the earth tearing it open and the impact
produced by it shook the mountains; the
Rākṣasī Jarā (who had joined the two parts
of the body of Jarāsandha) lay concealed
under the ground; she, together with
her sons and relatives, was killed due to
the impact of the गदा and the Sthūṇākarṇa
missile on the earth 7. 156. 10-14.

भागैः पृथक् पृथक्।अस्याम् एव प्रसूय-
ध्वम् … स्वैर् अंशैः संप्रसूयध्वम्
यथेष्टं मानुषेष्व् इति) 1. 58. 46-47;
Indra then requested Nārāyaṇa (Hari)
to be partially born, to which request he
agreed (अंशेनावतरस्वेति तथेत्याह च
तं हरिः) 1. 58. 51; Nārada, seeing the
kings who had assembled for the Rājasūya
of Yudhiṣṭhira, remembered the conversation
which in the bygone days took place
(पुरावृत्तां कथाम्) in the residence
of Brahman in regard to the partial incar-
nations on the earth and recognized that
what he saw before him was in fact the
assembly of the gods (देवानां संगमम्)

मन्त्रस् thrice (a day) acquires the fruit of
an Aśvamedha sacrifice; such a person drives
away quickly his sin, is honoured, and all
beings try to please him (अपि चैनं प्रसी-
दन्ति भूतानि) 12. 148. 26-27; one who bathes
in the water of the Kulyātīrtha and repeats
the Aghamarṣaṇa मन्त्रस् and, remaining
undefiled, fasts for three nights gets the fruit
of an Aśvamedha sacrifice 13. 26. 53; while
observing the ब्रह्मचर्य vow, if one slips
(makes a fault) in sleep he should recite
mentally the Aghamarṣaṇa मन्त्रस् thrice;
this way he burns the sin within himself
which was the result of the quality of passion
(मग्नः स्वप्ने च मनसा त्रिर् जपेद्
अघमर्षणम्॥पाप्मानं निर्दहेद् एवम्
अन्तर्भूतं रजोमयम्) 12. 207. 13-14.

(त्रयीविद्याम् अवेक्षेत वेदेषूक्ताम् अथाङ्ग-
तः।ऋक्सामवर्णाक्षरतो यजुषोऽथर्वणस्
तथा) 12. 227. 1; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) told
Arjuna that the great sages had mentioned
many of his names in the Atharvan as well
as in the other vedas (ऋग्वेदे सयजुर्वेदे
तथैवाथर्वसामसु … बहूनि मम
नामानि कीर्तितानि महर्षिभिः) 12. 328. 8-9;
the sage Sanatsujāta told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
the highest principle (ब्रह्मन्) was not to
be found in the Atharvan मन्त्रस्, nor in the
ऋक्स्, the यजुस्, or the सामन्स् (नैवर्क्षु
तन् न यजुःषु नाप्य् अथर्वसु न चैव
दृश्यत्य् अमलेषु सामसु) 5. 44. 21.

64. 33; a certain Ṛṣi, born in the family of
a Purohita (not named), when grew up
learnt, among other sciences, the Veda and
the Atharvaveda (अथर्ववेदे वेदे च
बभूवर्षिः सुनिश्चितः) 13. 10. 34; Bhaga-
vān (Kṛṣṇa) told Arjuna that the Vipras
who had learnt the Atharvāṇa looked upon
him as Atharvan consisting of five कल्पस्,
enlarged by कृत्यास् (पञ्चकल्पम् अथर्वा-
णं कृत्याभिः परिबृंहितम्।कल्पयन्ति हि
मां विप्रा अथर्वाणविदस् तथा) 12. 330.
34.
D. Use: 1. For worship: When
the sage Aṅgiras visited Indra he used for
worshipping the god the मन्त्रस् from the
Atharvaveda (अथर्ववेदमन्त्रैश् च);
Indra, while giving the sage a boon addressed
him as Atharvāṅgiras and said that the
मन्त्रस् from the Atharvaveda used by him
for his praise would be known as the
Atharvāṅgirasa section of that Veda
(अथर्वाङ्गिरसं नाम अस्मिन् वेदे भ-
विष्यति।उदाहरणम् एतद् धि) 5. 18. 5-7;
2. For magic: the Daityas and the Dānavas
residing in the Pātāla and who had studied
the different मन्त्रस् performed a sacrificial
rite (कर्म वैतानसंभवम्) by using
मन्त्रस् which included those known from
the Atharvaveda (बृहस्पत्युशनोक्तैश् च
मन्त्रैर् मन्त्रविशारदाः।अथर्ववेद-
प्रोक्तैश् च) in order to produce a कृत्या who
was commissioned to fetch Duryodhana who
had decided to fast unto death 3. 239. 20.
E. Personified: the Atharvaveda, along with
the other three Vedas, seen by Nārada in the
Sabhā of god Brahmadeva (अथर्ववेदश्

अथर्वशिरो ब्राह्मणोऽधीते अश्रोत्रियः

प्रवर्तते॥ … ऋग्यजुःसामभिर् जुष्टम्
अथर्वाङ्गिरसैस् तथा) 12. 322. 36-37; when
Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to insult Yudhiṣṭhira
which was as good as ‘killing’ him, he told
Arjuna that his instruction was according
to the Atharvāṅgirasī Śruti which was the
best among the Śrutis and which should be
practised without hesitation by those who
desired welfare (अथर्वाङ्गिरसी ह्य् एषा
श्रुतीनाम् उत्तमा श्रुतिः।अविचार्यैव

by diseases and although they take various
decoctions (कषायस्) and clarified butter
(सर्पींषि) for cure, they cannot avoid death
12. 28. 44-45;—Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that
his many names have been recounted by
great sages in the Sāṃkhya, the Yogaśāstra
and the Āyurveda 12. 328. 9; those versed
in the Āyurveda give the name Tridhātu to
Kṛṣṇa, since the body has three constituents
[bile (पित्त), phlegm (श्लेष्मन्) and
wind (वायु)] and is sustained by them
and when they are wasted away the body
is emaciated 12. 330. 21-22 [Nī. explains
Tridhātu as त्रयो धातव उपाधिभुताः
सन्त्य् अस्य स त्रिधातुः on Bom. Ed. 12.

from him and the sight he had obtained in
the Āraṇyaka (i. e. in the Āraṇyakaparvan
or during the stay in the forest ?) (ततः
प्रीतं भवं ज्ञात्वा स्मृतिमान् अर्जुनस्

तं च सुनीथं चापि यः स्मरेत्।दिवा वा
यदि वा रात्रौ नास्य सर्पभयं भवेत्
(cf. Nī. Bom Ed. 1. 58. 23: प्रसङ्गात्

218-219; in this पर्वन् Dhṛtarāṣṭra, with
Gāndhārī and Vidura, left the capital and
went to the hermitage; they were followed
by Pṛthā (Kuntī); in this hermitage the
king saw, by the favour of the sage Kṛṣṇa
(Vyāsa), his sons, grand-sons, and other
kings and heroes, who were killed in battle,
come back again; that was a wonder
unsurpassed (आश्चर्यम् अनुत्तमम् 1. 2.
215); seeing it Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī
abandoned grief and obtained high perfection
(सिद्धिं परमिकां गतः 1. 2. 215); in
this पर्वन्, we hear of Vidura and Saṃjaya

एताम् मनोरमाम्।आस्तीकस्य) 1. 13. 5;
it comprises Adhyāyas 1. 13-53; in this
sub-पर्वन् we are told about the birth of
the snakes and of Garuḍa, the churning of
the milky ocean, the origin of Uccaiśravas;
it provides the setting for the narration of
the story of the Bhāratas to Janamejaya,
son of Parikṣit, who was offering the snake-
sacrifice 1. 2. 73-74; according to some the
Bhārata begins with the Āstīka (parvan)
(मन्वादि भारतं केचिद् आस्तीकादि
तथापरे) 1. 1. 50; Ruru wanted to
know the life story of Āstīka (आस्तीक-
चरित), and the narrative (आख्यान) was
told to him by his father Pramati 1. 12. 3,
5; the elders called it an ancient इतिहास
which was narrated by Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
(Vyāsa) to the sages in the Naimiṣa forest
(इतिहासम् इमं वृद्धाः पुराणं परि-
चक्षते) 1. 13. 6; narrated by Sūta Loma-
harṣaṇa, pupil of Vyāsa, to the Brāhmaṇas
at their request; his son Sūta Ugraśravas
heard it from Lomaharṣaṇa and he, in turn,
narrated it to Śaunaka 1. 13. 7-8, 45;
Śaunaka again requested Sūta Ugraśravas
to tell the story (कथा) of Āstīka in
detail (सौते कथय ताम् एताम् विस्तरेण
कथां पुनः।आस्तीकस्य कवेः साधोः
शुश्रूषा परमा हि नः॥) 1. 14. 1; the
narrative of Āstīka confers long life (आयुष्-
यम् इदम् आख्यानम् आस्तीकम्) 1. 14. 4; the
आख्यान of Āstīka, his life-story (चरित),
is exceedingly pious (धर्मिष्ठ), increases
merit (of the listener) (पुण्यवर्धन),
and is illustrious (श्रीमत्); one who recites
it or listens to it from the very beginning
shall have no danger from the snakes 1. 53.
25-26.

इन्द्रलोकाभिगमन
Indralokābhigamana nt.: Name of the
32nd पर्वन् in the list of a hundred sub-
पर्वन्स् of the Bhārata supposed to have

or Vijaya (for short) 5. 18. 17.
It comprises अध्यायस् 5. 9-18; described
as an incident that occurred in the past, an
ancient इतिहास (पुरा वृत्तम् इतिहासं पुरा-
तनम्) 5. 9. 2; comparable to the Veda (in
importance) (वेदसंमितम्) 5. 18. 16; it
should be heard by a king desiring victory
when his army and that of his enemy are
arrayed (for a battle) 5. 18. 16; that is why
Śalya narrated the आख्यान Vijaya, in which
Indra's victory over Vṛtra and the downfall
of Nahuṣa were described, to Yudhiṣṭhira
before the start of the war 5. 18. 17; one who
diligently (नियतः) recites this Indravijaya
Ākhyāna is washed of all his sins, wins
heaven, and rejoices in this as well as in
the next world; he has no danger from the
enemy, and is never without a son (i. e. he
does not lose his sons in war ? न चारिजं
भयं तस्य न चापुत्रो भवेन् नरः); he

tents: when the Pāṇḍavas resided in Upa-
plavya, Duryodhana and Arjuna approached
Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) to seek his help in the com-
ing war; when Kṛṣṇa asked them to choose

chose the latter, while Dhanaṃjaya chose
the former; Dhṛtarāṣṭra sent Saṃjaya as his
envoy to the Pāṇḍavas for conciliation; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra having come to know (from Saṃjaya)
that the Pāṇḍavas would be led by Kṛṣṇa lost
sleep due to anxiety; Vidura gave Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra much sound advice; the sage Sanat-
sujāta gave him an excellent discourse on
the doctrine of soul (अध्यात्मम् अनुत्त-
मम् … श्रावितः); Saṃjaya told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra about the close association of Vāsu-
deva and Arjuna; Kṛṣṇa himself left for
Hāstinapura to seek conciliation with the
Kauravas; Duryodhana's rejection of Kṛṣṇa's
proposal which would be for the benefit
of both the parties; Kṛṣṇa sensing the
evil intention of Karṇa, Duryodhana and
the rest (to imprison him) displayed his
prowess as a योगेश्वर to the kings; Kṛṣṇa
tried to win over Karṇa to the side of the
Pāṇḍavas but Karṇa, due to his sense of
pride, did not oblige; the army consisting of
chariots, horses, soldiers and elephants,
marched out of Hāstinapura; counting of

the Udyogaparvan) and weaken the vigour
(तेजोवध) of Karṇa during the war (a
reference to 5. 18. 22-24) 6. 41. 81; that
Śikhaṇḍin was first born as a woman was
told by Bhīṣma in the Udyoga (reference to

ऋग्वेद
Ṛgveda m.: Name of one of the four
Vedic Saṃhitās.
A. Relationship with Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa:
Nārāyaṇa, the greatest of the gods (देव-
देव 3. 186. 129), told the sage Mārkaṇḍeya
that the Ṛgveda and the other Vedas arise
from him and enter into him (मत्तः
प्रादुर्भवन्त्य् एते माम् एव प्रविशन्ति च)
3. 187. 14; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) told Arjuna
that in the Ṛgveda and in many other texts
his names have been enumerated by great
sages (ऋग्वेदे … बहूनि मम नामानि
कीर्तितानि महर्षिभिः) 12. 328. 8-9; those
versed in the Vedas call Bhagavān as the
Ṛgveda of twentyone branches (एकविंशति-
शाखं च ऋग्वेदं मां प्रचक्षते। …
ये वै वेदविदो जनाः) 12. 330. 32.
B.
Source of mythology and व्रतस्: Gṛtsamada,
son of Vītahavya, who in appearance was
like another Indra, was once caught hold
of by the Daityas; this incident is referred to
in the Ṛgveda (cf. ṚV. 2. 12) where Gṛtsa-
mada is glorified by the Brāhmaṇas (ऋग्वेदे
वर्तते चाग्र्या श्रुतिर् अत्र विशां पते
यत्र गृत्समदो ब्रह्मन् ब्राह्मणैः स
महीयते) 13. 31. 56; a व्रत called Trisau-
parṇavrata, difficult to observe, is found in
the Ṛgveda (ऋग्वेदपाठपठितं व्रतम्
एतद् धि दुश्चरम्) 12. 336. 20.
C.
Ṛgveda personified: (1) Ṛgveda, along
with the Sāmaveda and the Purāṇas, move
in front of the chariot of Mahādeva to
protect it (when Śiva got ready to fight
with the Tripuras) 8. 24. 80; (2) Ṛgveda
together with the other three Vedas, visit the
Sabhā of Brahmadeva (2. 11. 19) and wait
on him 2. 11. 23, 31; (3) Ṛgveda, adorned
with क्रम and पद, came to the sacrifice
of Mahādeva (Śiva) who had assumed the
form of Varuṇa 13. 85. 4, 2. [See Ṛc]

ऋच्
Ṛc f. (mostly plural): Often stands
for the Ṛgveda or stanzas in it; in such
contexts Ṛc often occurs along with Yajus
and Sāman.
A. Number: their number given as
ten thousand (दशेदम् ऋक्सहस्राणि) 12.
238. 14 (दश किंचिदधिकानि ऋक्सहस्राणि)
Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 246. 14).
B. Their
study recommended and their chanting
referred to: the Brāhmaṇas are enjoined to
study the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and the सामन्स्
(सर्वान् वेदान् अधीयीत … ऋचो यजूंषि
सामानि) 12. 243. 2; 12. 260. 36; these are
to be studied with due respect for the
teacher; hence, while taking an oath to prove
his innocence, Bharadvāja said: “who steals
the lotus-stalks, may he study ऋच्स् and
यजुसेस् disrespecting his teacher” (उपाध्या-
यम् अधः कृत्वा ऋचो ऽध्येतु यजूंषि च।
 … बिसस्तैन्यं करोति यः) 13. 95. 62; a
Brāhmaṇa who can recite the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस्
and sing the सामन्स् is considered to be the
proper person to receive gifts (ऋग्यजुःसामगो
विद्वान् … पात्रम् उच्यते) 12. 297. 15; such
a learned Brāhmaṇa is to be honoured as
a god (ऋग्यजुःसामविद् पूज्यो नित्यं स्याद्
देववद् द्विजः) 12. 60. 42; Brāhmaṇas, ac-
companying the Pāṇḍavas to the Dvaitavana,
recited ऋच्स्, यजुसेस्, and सामन्स् (यजुषां
ऋचां च साम्नां च … आसीद् उच्चार्यमा-
णानाम् निस्वनो हृदयंगमः) 3. 27. 3;
those who had studied the ऋच्स्, recited them
according to the पद- and the क्रम-पाठ
in the sacrificial rites performed in Kaṇva's
hermitage (ऋचो बह्वृचमुख्यैश् च प्रेर्-
यमाणाः पदक्रमैः।शुष्राव … विततेष्व्
इह कर्मसु) 1. 64. 31; one should study
त्रयी विद्या (threefold knowledge), detailed
in the Vedas, from ऋच्, यजुस्, सामन्, and
अथर्वन् (त्रयीविद्याम् अवेक्षेत वेदेषूक्ताम्
अथाङ्गतः।ऋक्सामवर्णाक्षरतो यजुषो
ऽथर्वणस् तथा) 12. 227. 1.
C. Their
importance for Dharmaśāstra and Adhyātma-
śāstra: the शास्त्र, consisting of a hundred
thousand श्लोकस्, produced by the seven
sages, Marīci, Atri and others (12. 322.
26-27), and which is approved by the
ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स्, as well as by the
अथर्वाङ्गिरसस् will be the source of
धर्म (कृतं शतसहस्रं हि श्लोकानाम्
इदम् उत्तमम्। … प्रवृत्तौ च निवृत्तौ च
योनिर् एतद् भविष्यति।ऋग्यजुःसामभिर्
जुष्टम् अथर्वाङ्गिरसैस् तथा॥) 12. 322.
36-37; Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa) identifies himself
with ऋच्, सामन् and यजुस् (अहम् … ऋक्
साम यजुर् एव च) 6. 31. 17; the शास्त्र
constituting the secret of all the Vedas and
leading to the knowledge of आत्मन् was
churned out like nectar from the ten thou-
sand ऋच्स् (रहस्यं सर्ववेदानां … आत्म-
प्रत्ययिकं शास्त्रं … दशेदम् ऋक्सह-
स्राणि निर्मथ्यामृतम् उद्धृतम्) 12. 238.
13-14; there is only one सामन्, one यजुस्
and one ऋच् (एकं साम यजुर् एकम् ऋग्
एका) 12. 60. 45 (Nī. on 12. 60. 47 Bom.
Ed. अकारो वै सर्वा वाक् … इति श्रुतेर् एकम्
अकाररूपम् एव अक्षरं यथा सामादिरू-
पम्).
D. Their use and importance for
rites (real or metaphorical): ऋच्स् and
सामन्स् were chanted at the cremation
rites of those fallen in the war (साम्नां
ऋचां च नादेन) 11. 26. 40; those who know
Nārāyaṇa recite ऋच्स् (= stanzas as holy ऋच्स् ?)
to the effect that when formerly animals were
bound for the god Nārāyaṇa सामन्स् were
sung 14. 25. 16-17 (Nī. on 14. 25. 16
Bom. Ed.: ऋचः ‘तप आसीद् गृहपतिर्’
(Tai. Br. 3. 12. 9. 3) इत्याद्याः … शंसन्ति
योगयज्ञे प्रमाणत्वेन कथयन्ति तैत्तिरी-
यादयः।नारायणविदः वेदविद आत्मविदो
वा।नारायणाय आत्मप्राप्त्यर्थं यत्
यदा पशून् इन्द्रियाणि अविन्दन् वश्यत्वेन
प्राप्तवन्तः); a sacrifice has seventeen
constituents three of which are ऋच्स्, यजुसेस्
and सामन्स् (ऋचो यजूंषि सामानि … अङ्गान्य्
एतानि यज्ञस्य) 12. 260. 26.
E. Ṛcs used
for praising various deities: In this context
ऋच् does not always mean a stanza from
the Ṛgveda, but also one similar to it, or a
stanza in general: (1) Excellent Brāh-
maṇas praised Indra with praises consisting
of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स् (स्तूयमानं
द्विजाग्र्यैश् च ऋग्यजुःसामसंस्तवैः) 3.
44. 18; (2) son of Ṛcīka (Śunaḥśepa),
having praised with ऋच्स् gods who receive
shares in sacrifices, became Viśvāmitra's
son (ऋग्भिः स्तुत्वा महाभागो देवान् वै
यज्ञभागिनः) 12. 281. 13; (3) various
sages (Asita Devala and others 12. 281.
15-16) praised Viṣṇu with ऋच्स् and obtained
सिद्धि by practising तपस् due to his favour
(स्तुत्वा विष्णुम् ऋग्भिः) 12. 281. 17; (4)
Vyāsa, his pupils, and his son Śuka praised
Hari with ऋच्स् from all the four Vedas (स
चास्माकम् उपाध्यायः सहास्माभिर् विशां
पते।चतुर्वेदोद्गताभिश् च ऋग्भिस् तम्
अभितुष्टुवे) 12. 327. 100; Vyāsa and other
sages worshipped Kṛṣṇa with praises consi-
sting of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स् (ऋग्यजुः-
सामसंयुक्तैर् वचोभिः कृष्णम् अर्चयन्)
12. 52. 22; sages praised Madhusūdana with
praises adorned with the contents of ऋच्स्
(वाग्भिर् ऋग्भूषितार्थाभिः) 13. 126. 46;
(5) Upamanyu, as directed by his teacher
Dhaumya, praised Aśvins with the ऋच्
stanzas (1. 3. 60-70 which actually are not
from the Ṛgveda) to regain his eye-sight
(वाग्भिर् ऋग्भिः) 1. 3. 59; (6) Śiva is
praised with ऋच्स् in Tantric rites by those
who are versed in the Ṛgveda (ऋग्भिर् यम्
अनुशंसन्ति तन्त्रे कर्मणि बह्वृचः)
(? बह्वृचाः)) 13. 16. 48; sages praised
goddess Umā with praises adorned with the
contents of the ऋच्स् (वाग्भिर् ऋग्भूषितार्था-
भिः) 13. 128. 24.
F. Their importance
and utility limited: Sage Sanatsujāta told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the छन्दस् (ऋच्), यजुस्
and सामन् did not save one from sin 5. 43.
1-3; the ऋच्स्, the सामन्स् and the यजुसेस्
have a beginning and therefore an end i. e.
they are not eternal (12. 199. 16-18); the
अक्षर पद is not to be found in the ऋच्स्,
यजुसेस्, अथर्वन्स्, and सामन्स् 5. 44. 21;
even after studying the collections of the
ऋच्स् and the सामन्स्, and the यजुसेस्
Bṛhaspati did not know the source of beings
(ऋक्सामसंघांश् च यजूंषि चाहम् …
अधीत्य … भूतप्रकृइत्ं न वेद्मि) 12.
194. 8; mortals who believed in non-
distinction (between ब्रह्मन् and आत्मन्)
having seen that the ऋच्स्, the सामन्स्,
the यजुसेस् and the prosperity desired
(through them) was something distinct (from
the highest self) (resorted) to तपस् by
practising austerities (अपृथग्धर्मिणो
मर्त्या ऋक्सामानि यजूंषि च।काम्यां
पुष्टिम् पृथग् दृष्ट्वा तपोभिस् तप एव
च) 12. 224. 63 (अद्वैतनिष्ठा मर्त्यास्
तप एव योगम् एव कृतयुगे ऽनुतिष्ठन्तीति
शेषः।ऋगादीनि काम्या इष्टीश् च … पृथक्
तपोभिर् आलोचनैः दृष्ट्वा … तत् परित्यज्य
योगपरा एव बभूवुर् इत्य् अर्थः Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 12. 232. 33); also cf. तपोयज्ञा
द्विजातयः 12. 224. 61; all those who see
the non-distinction (between पौरुष कर्म
दैव, and स्वभाव 12. 230. 4-5), keep away
(दृष्ट्वा = कृत्वा) their love and hatred for
ऋच्स्, सामन्स् and यजुसेस्, and practise तपस्
in the Kṛta age (अपृथग्दर्शिनः सर्वे
ऋक्सामसु यजुःषु च।कामद्वेशौ पृथग्
दृष्ट्वा तपः कृत उपासते) 12. 230. 8 (Nī.
however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 238. 8: वेदत्रये ऽपि
भेदम् अपश्यन्तः काम्यादीन् (? कामादीन्)
पृथक्कृत्य तपो ज्ञानम् उपासते श्रयन्ति).
[See Ṛgveda]

ऋषिवंश
Ṛṣivaṃśa m.: Name of a passage in
the Anuśāsanaparvan listing the names of
sages and also of kings, some of whom are
royal sages (राजर्षि) 13. 151. 30-51.
The names of sages, rich in austerities,
who having practised austerities had attained
perfection (विप्रांस् तपःसिद्धांस् तपोधि-
कान् 13. 151. 30) are listed according to the
quarters they occupy: Yavakrīta, Raibhya,
Kakṣīvān and some others in the east;
Ulmucu, Pramucu, Mumucu and some
others in the south; Uṣadgu and his brothers,
Parivyādha, Dīrghatamas and some others
in the west; Atri, Vasiṣṭha, Śakti and some
others in the north 13. 151. 31-40; the
recitation of the Ṛṣivaṃśa, along with that
of the Daivatavaṃśa, at two twilights is
very effective in removing sins (द्विसं-
ध्यं पठितः पुत्र कल्मषापहरः
परः) 13. 151. 2; (कीर्तितान् … सर्वपापप्र-
मोचनान्) 13. 151. 30; then follow names of
kings beginning with Nṛga and ending with
Kakṣasena 13. 151. 41-50; some of these
kings are royal sages, viz. Mucakunda
(राजर्षिः) 13. 151. 46; Śveta (राजर्षिसत्-
तमः) 13. 151. 47, Kṣupa (राजर्षिः) 13.
151. 48, Nala (राजर्षिः) 13. 151. 49, and
Kakṣasena (राजर्षिः) 13. 151. 50; the list
is apparently intended to be recited by one
who does not wish to meet with difficulties, nor
incur sin, nor encounter enemies, and by one
who wishes to have sure victory and great
happiness after death (मा विघ्नं मा
च मे पापं मा च मे परिपन्थिनः।
ध्रुवो जयो मे नित्यं स्यात् परत्र च परा
गतिः) 13. 151. 51.

दशती to mean ‘one thousand’ and reads
सृतयो for सूतयो; he explains the line as:
दशशतीशब्दस्य पृषोदरादिशकारलोपेन
दशतीशब्दः सहस्रवाची सृतयो मार्गाः।
‘ॐकारो वै सर्वा वाक्’ इति श्रुतेर् वेदस्य
शाखाप्रशाखादिभेदो ऽत्रैव जात इत्य्
अर्थः on Bom. Ed. 5. 108. 14); the शास्त्र
that was proclaimed unanimously by the
seven sages Marīci, Atri, Aṅgiras, Pulastya,
Pulaha, Kratu and Vasiṣṭha (12. 322. 27) was
at the very beginning adorned with the syllable
ओम् (आदाव् एव हि तच्छास्त्रम् ॐकारस्वर-
भूषितम्) 12. 322. 34; when Agni was
cursed by Bhṛgu, he disappeared; then the
people, since they could not give offerings
in the fire became devoid of ॐकारस् and
वषट्कारस् (निर्ॐकारवषट्काराः … विना-

जतुगृहस्यात्र) 1. 2. 35.
Alluded to, though not directly by this
name, in the list of contents of the Ādipar-
van 1. 2. 83; also listed by Vaiśaṃpāyana

Referred to as an item in the list of the

जय
Jaya m.: Name of a type of Itihāsa
(जयो नामेतिहासो ऽयम्) 1. 56. 19; 5. 134.
17; 18. 5. 39.
Usually this is considered to be the desi-
gnation of that text which was originally
composed by Vyāsa and later, with gradual
additions, grew to become the Bhārata and the
Mahābhārata at the hands of Vaiśāṃpāyana
and Sūta Ugraśravas respectively; as the name
of the Mahābhārata it probably occurs in the
opening मङ्गल श्लोक found at the begin-
ning of the different पर्वन्स् (नारायणं
नमस्कृत्य नरं चैव नरोत्तमम्।
देवीं सरस्वतीं चैव ततो जयम् उदीर-
येत्॥) which is not found in all the versions;
according to V. S. Sukthankar, however,
“ … Jaya is a गेनेरिच् name applicable to
different works, and not a specific name of
the Mahābhārata at all as believed by some
writers” (Ādiparvan, p. 989, note on 56. 19);
the recitation of this kind of Itihāsa should
be heard by a king who desires victory; he
then conquers the earth and shall defeat his
enemies; it should also often be heard by a
chief queen since it is as good as a rite
calculated to lead to the birth of a son (पुं-
सवनम्) and by a crown prince since it
is the royal road to welfare (स्वस्त्ययनं
महत्) 1. 56. 19-20; its recitation is re-
commended for a king desiring prosperity
(भूतिम्), for princes in general, and for
any pregnant woman; it is also said that
hearing it one who desires heaven will
go to heaven, one who wants victory will
win victory, and a pregnant woman will
deliver a son or a fortunate girl (पुत्रं
कन्यां वा बहुभागिनीम्) 18. 5. 39-40; the
narrative called the Vidurāputrānuśāsana
(5. 131-135) is also classed as the Jaya
type of Itihāsa 5. 134. 17; a minister should
recite this to a king who is oppressed by his
enemies and who is dejected since this tract,
being a powerful exhortation, is best suited
to cause increase in energy (इदम् उद्ध-
रणं भीमं तेजोवर्धनम् उत्तमम्);
the rest of the श्रवणफल given here is
the same as for the Mahābhārata (as a Jaya
type of composition) with the addition which
gives the qualities of the son to be born to
a woman 5. 134. 16-21.

नुशब्दितम्॥नारायणमुखोद्गीतम्);
Nārada narrated it to Brahman 12. 326. 101-
102, from whom it passed on successively to
the Siddhas, Sūrya, 66000 ऋषिस्, gods द्विज
Asita manes (पितृस्) (including Śaṃtanu);
from Śaṃtanu it went to Bhīṣma and then to
Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 326. 105-111; (2) (धर्म)
narrated by Nārāyaṇa himself to Narada
12. 336. 50, and then by Nārada to Pārtha
(Yudhiṣṭhira) in the presence of the sages
(including Vyāsa), and within the hearing of
Kṛṣṇa and Bhīṣma 12. 336. 11 (or by Nārada
to Vyāsa and then by Vyāsa to Yudhiṣṭhira,
the sages, Kṛṣṇa and Bhīṣma 12. 336. 59-

by Nārada to Vyāsa seated among the sages,
and to the Pāṇḍavas within the hearing of

G. स्रवणफल: (of the आख्यान or the
कथा) One who always recites this आख्यान
or listens to it, being devoted to one object,
and very attentively, in a secluded place
(एकान्तभावोपगत एकान्ते सुसमाहितः),
reaches the Śvetadvīpa and, having obtained
the lustre of the moon, would no doubt enter
the god of thousand flames (स सहस्रार्-
चिषम् देवं प्रविशेन् नात्र संशयः) 12.
326. 116-17; (12. 327. 6); it one, afflicted
(by diseases) listens to this कथा from the
beginning, he will be freed from the disease;
one who listens to it out of curiosity
(जिज्ञासुः) obtains his desires, and a devotee
(after death) would go along the course of a
devotee (भक्तो भक्तगतिं व्रजेत्) 12. 326.
118; (of the ज्ञान expounded by Vyāsa) one
who listens to it or one who recites it, having
bowed down to Bhagavān and with attentive
mind, is freed from disease, becomes lustrous,
and gets strength and good complexion; one
who is suffering from illness is freed of
illness, one held in captivity is released from
bonds, one who entertains desires obtains them
and long life; a Brāhmaṇa thereby knows all,
a Kṣatriya is victorious, a Vaiśya obtains
much profit and a Śūdra becomes happy; one
who is devoid of a son has a son; a maiden
gets the cherished husband, the woman who
experiences difficulty in delivery delivers easily
(लग्नगर्भा विमुच्यते), a pregnant woman
delivers a son, a barren woman has abundant
progeny consisting of sons and grandsons;
one who recites this while on journey reaches
his destination safely; (in short) whatever
desire a person entertains that he definitely
gets; this is the considered assurance of the
great sage (इदं महर्षेर् वचनं विनिश्-
चितम्) that by listening to the praise of the
Excellent Person (पुरुषवर) the devotees
are very comfortable (निशम्य भक्ताः सु-
सुखं लभन्ते) 12. 327. 102-107.
H.
End: After listening to this great Nārāyaṇīya
आख्यान, king Janamejaya resumed all the

श्रुत्वा पारिक्षितो नृपः।ततो यज्ञसमा-
प्त्यर्थं क्रियाः सर्वाः समारभत्॥ 12.
334. 11). [See Puruṣasukta, Hayaśiras]

मुनिर् उदारधीः।मत्प्रसादाद् अधो
नष्टं निरुक्तम् अभिजग्मिवान्; Nī. अधो
नष्टं वेदहरणवेलायां पाताले ऽन्तर्हि-
तम् on Bom. Ed. 12. 342. 73); those who
know the Nirukta (name of the text ?) and
the Veda praise Kṛṣṇa as Adhokṣaja in the
ritual context 12. 330. 18 (निरुक्तम् वेद-
विदुषो … ते मां गायन्ति प्राग्वंशे अधो-
क्षज इति स्थितिः; Nī. प्राग्वंशे यज्ञशा-
लैकदेशे on Bom. Ed. 12. 342. 83); gods
long for him who knows the Vedas, the
Vedāṅgas (?), the whole sacrificial proce-
dure, the Nirukta (text ?), and the highest
truth to be in the शरीरात्मन् (वेदांश् च
वेद्यं च विधिं च कृत्स्नम् अथो निरुक्तं
परमार्थतां च।सर्वं शरीरात्मनि
यः प्रवेद तस्मै स्म देवाः स्पृहय-
न्ति नित्यम् 12. 237. 30; but Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 12. 245. 30: वेद्यं वियदादि, विधिं
कर्मकाण्डम्, निरुक्तं शब्दैकगम्यं
परलोकादि परमार्थताम् सत्यस्वभाव-
तां चात्मनः); Bṛhaspati told Prajāpati
that even after studying the Vedas and the
other texts like the Nirukta and the
Vyākaraṇa he does not know the ultimate
source of beings (भूतप्रकृतिं न वेद्मि)
12. 194. 8; the Nirukta (personified, among

the Ādiparvan in which the sub-पर्वन्स् are
listed (1. 2. 34-70) and the contents of the
18 major पर्वन्स् are summarized (1. 2.
71-234); thus the Parvasaṃgraha forms the
layout of the grand narrative of the Mahā-
bhārata (आख्यानं तद् इदम् अनुत्तमं
महार्थम् विन्यस्तं महद् इह पर्व-
संग्रहेण) 1. 2. 243; if one first listens
to this summary of the contents, it becomes
easy for him to go through the Bhārata as

भारत
Bhārata, Mahābhārata nt.: Name of
the great epic composed by Vyāsa, who was
also known as Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana; the title
Bhārata once given to an abridgement of
the original in 24000 श्लोकस् made by
dropping the उपाख्यानस् (चतुर्विंशति-
साहस्रीम् चक्रे भारतसंहिताम्।उपा-
ख्यानैर् विना तावद् भारतं प्रोच्यते
बुधैः॥) 1. 1. 61; also called Bhāratī
kathā (श्रोतुं पात्रं च राजंस् त्वं
प्राप्येमां भारतीं कथाम्) 1. 55. 3.
A. Contents and definition: It nar-
rates the extensive life-story of the Kurus
(कुरूणां चरितं महत्) 1. 56. 1, or the
full story of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas
(कुरूणां चरितं कृत्स्नम् पाण्डवानां
च भारत) 18. 5. 25; or the history of
Śaṃtanu (यस्य (i. e. शंतनोः) इतिहासो
द्युतिमान् महाभारतम् उच्यते) 1. 93.
46; Vaiśaṃpāyana summarized for Jana-
mejaya its contents in three words, ‘breach,
loss of kingdom, and victory’ (एवम्
एतत् पुरावृत्तं तेषाम् अक्लिष्टकर्मणाम्।
भेदो राज्यविनाशश् च जयश् च
जयतां वर) 1. 55. 43 (also cf. 1. 55.
4-5 where the three events are referred to
as भेद, वनवास and युद्ध); earlier the
three events are referred to by a single
word भेद (कुरूणां पाण्डवानां च
यथा भेदो ऽभवत् पुरा) 1. 54. 22, or
by two भेद and राज्यविनाश (भेदं
राज्यविनाशं च कुरुपाण्डवयोस् तदा)
1. 54. 24; the sage (Vyāsa) examined
together the शास्त्रस् related to Dharma,
Kāma and Artha, as also other शास्त्रस्, and
the laws that govern the affairs of the world;
next also the histories with their commen-
taries and different revealed texts; all that
is included here—this defines the text
(of the Mahābhārata) (धर्मकामार्थ-

C. Author: The great epic composed by
the great sage Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, also
called Vyāsa, the son of Satyavatī 1. 1.
9-10 (कृष्णद्वैपायनप्रोक्ताः … कथाः …

named); came out of the lips of Dvaipāyana
(द्वैपायनोष्ठपुटनिःसृतम्) 1. 2. 242

(कृष्णद्वैपायनेनेदं कृतम्); fully
engrossed, the sage composed it in three
years (त्रिभिर् वर्सैः सदोत्थायी कृष्णद्वै-
पायनो मुनिः।महाभारतम् आख्यानं
कृतवान्) 1. 56. 32, 18. 5. 41; 12. 334. 9
(कृष्णद्वैपायनं व्यासं विद्धि नारा-
यणं प्रभुम्।को ह्य् अन्यः पुरुषव्या-
घ्र महाभारत्कृद् भवेत्); having com-
posed it at the foot of the mountain Hima-
vant the sage (not named) was tired by the
strenuous activity (? तपः) of composing
the आख्यान (हिमवत्पाद आसतः॥कृत्वा
भारतम् आख्यानं तपःश्रान्तस्य धी-
मतः) 12. 337. 9-10; 18. 5. 31 (कृष्णेन
मुनिना); 18. 5. 46 (महर्षिर् भगवान्
व्यासः कृत्वेमां संहितां पुरा); the sage
Kṛṣṇa (Vyāsa) who is described as gifted
with divine sight (दिव्यचक्षुः 18. 5. 7) and
supersensory power (कृष्णेन … अतीन्द्रियेण
18. 5. 31-32) composed it having seen it with
his divine eye (दृष्ट्वा दिव्येन चक्षुषा) 18.
5. 33; Vyāsa had assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
he would proclaim the fame of the Kurus
and the Pāṇḍavas 6. 2. 13; the sage is also
credited to have made the Parvasaṃgraha
listing a hundred sub-पर्वन्स् of the Bhārata
(एतत् पर्वशतं पूर्णं व्यासेनोक्तं
महात्मना) 1. 2. 70.
D. Etymology:
So called because of its extent (? impor-
tance ?) and weight (महत्त्वाद् भारवत्त्वाच्
च महाभारतम् उच्यते।निरुक्तम् अस्य
यो वेद) 1. 1. 209; so called because it
contains the great life-story (?) of the
Bhāratas (भारतानां महज् जन्म महा-
भारतम् उच्यते।निरुक्तम् अस्य यो वेद)
1. 56. 31.
E. Extent: One hundred
thousand श्लोकस् 1. 56. 13 (इदं शतसहस्-
रं हि श्लोकानां पुण्यकर्मणाम्); 12.
331. 2 (इदं शतसहस्राद् धि भारता-
ख्यानविस्तरात्).
F. Abridgements: Its
abridgements are referred to in 1. 1. 25
(विस्तरैश् च समासैश् च धार्यते यद्
द्विजातिभिः); the sage himself is credited
with an abridgement of the store of know-
ledge after he had first expounded it in full;
learned men desire to preserve it in full as
well as in abridgement (विस्तीर्यैतन् महज्
ज्ञानम् ऋषिः संक्षेपम् अब्रवीत्।इष्तं हि
विदुसां लोके समासव्यासधारनम्) 1. 1.
49; the sage Dvaipāyana abridged (the full
extent of one hundred thousand श्लोकस् into
24000 श्लोकस् by omitting the उपाख्यानस्-
this is known as Bhārata (चतुर्विंशतिसा-
हस्रीं चक्रे भारतसंहिताम्।उपाख्या-
नैर् विना तावद् भारतं प्रोच्यते बुधैः)
1. 1. 61; it was further abridged into 150
श्लोकस् in the form of a table of contents of all
the incidents of the sub-पर्वन्स् (this could
refer to 1. 2. 71-233) (ततो ऽध्यर्धशतं
भूयः संक्षेपं कृतवान् ऋषिः।अनुक्रम-
णिम् अध्यायं वृत्तान्तानां सपर्वणाम् 1. 1.
62; एतद् अखिलम् आख्यातं भारतं पर्व-
संग्रहात् 1. 2. 234); the list of the hundred
sub-पर्वन्स् of the Bhārata (1. 2. 34-1. 2.
70) is included in its abridgement (समासो
भारतस्यायं तत्रोक्तः पर्वसंग्रहः)
1. 2. 71; before narrating in all details, the
Mahābhārata was first summarized by
Vaiśampāyana for Janamejaya (कथितं
वै समासेन त्वया सर्वं द्विजोत्तम।
महाभारतं आख्यानम्) 1. 56. 1;
this summary began with the return of
the Pāṇḍavas to Hāstinapura after the
death of Pāṇḍu and it ended with the death
of Duryodhana and the Pāṇḍavas obtaining
the kingdom 1. 55. 6-42; a sort of a sum-
mary which began with Pāṇḍu's conquering
many countries and then retiring to the forest
and ended with the great destruction after the
war leaving only ten heroes alive is made by
Sūta Ugraśravas for the sages assembled in
the Naimiṣa forest 1. 1. 67-158.
G. Three
beginnings: According to Sūta Ugraśravas
there were three different views regarding the
beginning of the Bhārata: (1) according
to one view it began with Manu Vaivasvata
(मन्वादि भारतं केचित्) 1. 1. 50 (i. e.
with प्रजापतेस् तु दक्षस्य मनोर् वैवस्-
वतस्य च। … अन्वये॥यादवानाम् इमं
वंशं पौरवाणां च सर्वशः।तथैव
भारतानां च (?) 1. 70. 1-2); Devabodha
on 1. 1. 50 explains मनुः as आदिराजः;
according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 52, in
the opinion of the easterners, मनु means
मन्त्र and hence मन्वादि refers to the
मङ्गल stanza नारायणं नमस्कृत्य etc.
or ओम् नमो भगवते etc. found at the
beginning of the epic in some manuscripts;
in his own opinion, however, मनु refers to
Manu Vaivasvata, the son of the heaven, cf.
मनुर् मन्त्रः नारायणं नमस्कृत्येति।
ओम् नमो भगवते वासुदेवायेति वा तदादि
इति प्रञ्चः।दिवः पुत्रो वैवस्वतमह्य-
संज्ञो मनुस् तदादीति तत्त्वम्।); (2)
according to another view the Bhārata
begins with आस्तीक (आस्तीकादि तथापरे)
1. 1. 50 (i. e. with the अध्याय 1. 13
beginning of the Āstīkaparvan); (3) accor-
ding to a third view it begins with उपरिचर
(तथोपरिचराद् अन्ये) 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with
राजोपरिचरो नाम 1. 57. 1).
H. Its
first teaching and subsequent narrations:
(1) Teaching: Dvaipāyana (Vyāsa) first
taught it to his son Śuka and then handed
it over to his other deserving pupils 1. 1. 63;
he taught it to Śuka together with the four
श्लोकस् (18. 5. 47-50) known as the Bhārata-
sāvitrī 18. 5. 51; Vyāsa taught the Mahabhā-
rata to his pupils Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila,
Vaiśaṃpāyana and to his son Śuka 1. 57.
74-75; Vyāsa taught it to them on the mount
Meru 12. 327. 16-18; on the slope of the
Himavant mountain (हिमवत्पादे) 12. 337.
9, 12, 14-15 (वेदार्थान् भारतार्थांश् च
 … व्याहर्तुम् उपचक्रमे); (2) Narra-
tions: (i) Nārada recited it for the gods,
Asita Devala for the manes (पितृन्), and
Śuka for the Gandharvas, the Yaksas and the
demons 1. 1. 64; 18. 5. 42; (ii) The pupils
of Vyāsa made separate public recitations of
the Bhārata saṃhitā received by them from
him (संहितास् तैः पृथक्त्वेन भारतस्य
प्रकाशिताः) 1. 57. 75; (iii) one such reci-
tation by his pupil Vaiśaṃpāyana is recorded
in the epic: When Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana arrived
at the snake-sacrifice of Janamejaya he was
requested by the king to narrate to him the
life-story of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas
(1. 54. 18 ff.); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana then
asked his pupil Vaiśaṃpāyana to narrate it
as the latter had heard it from him; Vaiśaṃ-
pāyana then narrated the whole पुरातन
इतिहास to the king, and to those who had
assembled in the सदस्, and to all other
Kṣatriyas (तस्मै राज्ञे सदस्येभ्यः
क्षत्रियेभ्यश् च सर्वशः) 1. 54. 21-24;
1. 1. 8-10; 1. 1. 18; 1. 1. 57-58; 1. 55. 2-3;
1. 55. 4-43 (summary); 18. 5. 26, 30, 42;
18. 1. 2; (iv) but in one place the आख्यान
is said to have been narrated by Vyāsa
himself to Janamejaya continuously (व्यासस्
त्व् अकथयन् नित्यम् आख्यानं भारतं
महत्) 1. 53 31; he narrated it in intervals
(महाभारतम् आख्यानं … जनमेजयेन
यत् पृष्टः कृष्णद्वैपायनस् तदा॥श्रा-
वयाम् आस विधिवत् तदा कर्मान्तरेषु
सः।) 1. 53. 32-33; (v) it was further
narrated by Sūta Ugraśravas, son of Loma-
harṣaṇa, to Śaunaka and the other sages
assembled in the Naimiṣa forest for the
twelve-yearly sacrificial session of Śaunaka
as the Sūta had heard the composition of
Vyāsa being told by Vaiśaṃpāyana to Jana-
mejaya in the latter's snake sacrifice 1. 1.
8-10, 23; 1. 4. 1; 1. 2. 74; 1. 1. 67-158
(summary); 1. 2. 29; Ugraśravas recounted
the Parvasaṃgraha (1. 2. 34-69) made by
Vyāsa as also the eighteen major पर्वन्स्
(एतत् पर्वशतं पूर्णं व्यासेनोक्तं
महात्मना।यथावत् सूतपुत्रेण लोम-
हर्षणिना पुनः॥कथितं नैमिषारण्ये
पर्वाण्य् अष्टादशैव तु) 1. 2. 70-71; the
Sūta also narrated the summary of the
eighteen major पर्वन्स् (based on the
hundred sub-पर्वन्स्) together with the
number of the अध्यायस् and the श्लोकस्
in each पर्वन् 1. 2. 72-234; 1. 53. 27-
36; 18. 5. 30.
I. Purpose: To spread
the fame of the Pāṇḍavas in the world
(पाण्डवानां यशस्करम्) 1. 53. 32; of
the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas 6. 2. 13;
and also of the other Kṣatriyas possessing
ample wealth and lustre (कीर्तिम् प्रथयता

K.
Importance: In this epic Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana
has expounded a holy उपनिषद् (अत्रोपनि-
षदं पुण्यां कृष्णद्वैपायनो ऽब्रवीत्)
1. 1. 191; truth and nectar constitute the
body of the Bhārata (as the butter of
curds and the Brāhmaṇa of the bipeds)
भारतस्य वपुर् ह्य् एतत् सत्यं चामृतम्
एव च) 1. 1. 201 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1.
264: सत्यं ब्रह्म अमृतं देवभावश्
च अत्रैवास्तीत्य् अर्थः); as ocean is the
best of the reservoirs of water, a cow of
the quadrupeds, so is the Bhārata (among
the literary works) 1. 1. 201-202; one should
expand this Veda (of Kṛṣṇa) with the help
of the Itihāsa and Purāṇa for, with the
thought: “he may (easily) go over me” the
Veda is afraid of one who has not studied
much (इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुप-
बृंहयेत्।बिभेत्य् अल्पश्रुताद् वेदो माम्
अयं प्रतरिष्यति) 1. 1. 204 (Devabodha:
उपबृंहणम् अर्थान्तरकल्पनया क्षीण-
स्य यथावद् व्याख्यानेन परिपोषः; Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 268: “यद् ध
त्यं मायिनं मृगम् तम् उ त्यं मायया-

अल्पश्रुताद् वेदस्य भयम् उचितम् एव।
वेदार्थजिज्ञासुना इदम् अवश्यम् अध्येत्-
अव्यम् इत्य् अर्थः); when the sages once
weighed the Bhārata in a balance against
the four Vedas put together it outweighed
them in largeness and heaviness (महत्त्वे
च गुरुत्वे च ध्रियमाणं ततो ऽधिकम्)
1. 1. 208 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 273:
महत्त्वे ग्रन्थत आधिक्ये गुरुत्वे
अर्थत आधिक्ये); best among the works
which deserve to be heard (when recited)
(श्राव्याणाम् उत्तमं चेदं) 1. 56. 15;
having heard this Purāṇa, composed by
the great sage Dvaipāyana, it was honoured
(अभिपूजितम्) by gods and Brahmarṣis
1. 1. 15; here are glorified holy divine
sages (देवर्षयः पुण्याः), brahmanical
and royal sages of auspicious deeds (पुण्या
ब्रह्मराजर्षयस् तथा।कीर्त्यन्ते शुभ-
कर्माणः), the Yakṣas and the great
snakes, as also lord Vāsudeva 1. 1. 192-193;
in this Purāṇa are expounded fully the two
Puruṣārthas अर्थ and धर्म (अस्मिन्न्
अर्थश् च धर्मश् च निखिलेनोपदिश्यते)
1. 56. 16; in respect of all the four Puruṣārthas
viz. धर्म, अर्थ, काम and मोक्ष, what-
ever is here will be found elsewhere, what is
not here cannot be found anywhere (धर्मे
चार्थे च कामे च मोक्षे च भरतर्षभ।
यद् इहास्ति तद् अन्यत्र यन् नेहास्ति न तत्
क्वचित्।) 1. 56. 33 = 18. 5. 38; in this highly
sacred Itihāsa one finds the exposition lead-
ing to emancipation (बुद्धिश् च परिनै-
ष्ठिकी) 1. 56. 16; (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1.
62. 17: परिनिष्ठा मोक्षस् तदुचिता); this
is a text on profit (अर्थशास्त्रम्), a holy
treatise on law (पुण्यं धर्मशास्त्रम्),
a way to liberation (मोक्षशास्त्र) as ex-
pounded by Vyāsa 1. 56. 21; this is a great
store of knowledge of the three worlds which
is committed to memory by the twice-born
fully and in abridgements (इदं तु त्रिषु
लोकेषु महज् ज्ञानं प्रतिष्ठितम्।विस्त-
रैश् च समासैश् च धार्यते यद् द्विजाति-
भिः) 1. 1. 25; 1. 1. 49; storehouse of choice
objects (रत्ननिधि) 1. 56. 27 = 18. 5. 52;
the unsurpassed ocean of knowledge-having
churned it with his intellect Vaiśaṃpāyana
collected the आख्यान based on the Nārāyaṇa-
kathā (इदं (i. e. आख्यानं)  … आमथ्य
दधिमन्थेन ज्ञानोदधिम् अनुत्तमम्।
नवनीतं यथा दध्नो … समुद्धृतं …
नारायणकथाश्रयम्) 12. 331. 1-4; some
poets have narrated this इतिहास (composed
by Vyāsa) before (Sūta Ugraśravas did
it), some of the contemporaries of Ugra-
śravas were narrating it in his times, and
others will narrate it in future (आचख्युः
कवयः केचित् संप्रत्य् आचक्षते परे।
आख्यास्यन्ति तथैवान्ये इतिहासम् इमम्
भुवि) 1. 1. 24; 1. 56. 22; even if one knew
the four Vedas together with their अङ्गस्
and the Upaniṣads, but did not know this
आख्यान, he could not be called learned
(विचक्षण) 1. 2. 235; having once listened
to this आख्यान one does not like to listen
to any other composition although worth
hearing 1. 2. 236; the intellects of the poets
take their start from this excellent इतिहास
(इतिहासोत्तमाद् अस्माज् जायन्ते कविबुद्ध-
यः) 1. 2. 237; there is no narrative on this
earth which does not have its basis in this
आख्यान (अनाश्रित्यैतद् आख्यानं कथा
भुवि न विद्यते) 1. 2. 240; all great poets
live on this आख्यान (इदं सर्वैः कवि-
वरैर् आख्यानम् उपजीव्यते) 1. 2. 241; the
whole Purāṇa is included in the scope of this
आख्यान (अस्याख्यानस्य विषये पुराणं
वर्तते द्विजाः) 1. 2. 238; all good qualities
of actions have this आख्यान for their rest-
ing place (i. e. they are motivated by this
आख्यान) (क्रियागुणानां सर्वेषाम् इदम्
आख्यानम् आश्रयः) 1. 2. 239 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 1. 2. 387: क्रियाः लौकिक्यो वैदिक्यश् च
तासां गुणाः उत्कृष्टफलसाधनानि।अथवा
क्रियाः दानध्यानादयः।गुणाः शमाद-
यः).
L. फलश्रुति: If one recites
with devotion even a quarter of the Bhārata
all his sins, without a remainder, get puri-
fied (भारताध्ययनात् पुण्यद् अपि पादम्
अधीयतः।श्रद्दधानस्य पूयन्ते सर्व-
पापान्य् अशेषतः) 1. 1. 191 (but Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 254: अस्य श्लोकस्य चतुर्-
थांशोच्चारणमात्राद् अपि सर्वपापनाशः
किं वाच्यं कृत्स्नाध्ययनात् तदर्थस्य

45 (here, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 18. 5. 59:
पादं श्लोकपादं ग्रन्थपादं वा); if
one were to recite a quarter of the Bhā-
rata for the Brāhmaṇas at the end of a
श्राद्ध he will ensure for the manes
inexhaustible food and drink (यश् चैनं
(? इदम् cf. 1. 56. 29) श्रावयेच् छ्राद्धे
ब्राह्मणान् पादम् अन्ततः।अक्षय्यम्
अन्नपानम् तत् पितॄंस् तस्योपतिष्ठति) 1. 1.
203; 18. 5. 36 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 18. 5. 42:
अन्ततः निकटे); 1. 56. 29 (अक्षय्यं तस्य
तच् छ्राद्धम् उपतिष्ठेत् पितॄन् अपि); after
reciting the whole of this Veda of Kṛṣṇa
(i. e. the Bhārata) one attains profit, and one
will undoubtedly get rid of even the sin of
killing an embryo 1. 1. 205; one who recites
it for those that are not low, are generous,
truthful and believers attains profit 1. 56. 17;
even a very cruel person after hearing this Iti-
hāsa will be rid of the sin of killing an embryo
1. 56. 18; one who learns the Bharata when
it is being recited need not bathe in the waters
of Puṣkara 1. 2. 242; 18. 5. 54; one who
recites for others the composition of Vyāsa
and one who listens to it, all of them having
attained to the place of Brahman become
equal to gods 1. 56. 14; this (i. e. listening
to the recitation of the Bhārata) is the best
 means for obtaining a male child (पुंसव-
नं श्रेष्ठम्), a high road to one's well-
being (स्वस्त्ययनं महत्), it should be
listened to by the chief queen and the crown
prince 1. 56. 20; (of one who narrates this),
his sons are obedient to him and his servants
do him good (पुत्राः शुश्रूषवः सन्ति
प्रेष्याश् च प्रियकारिणः) 1. 56. 22; one
who listens to it divests himself quickly of
all sins incurred by body, speech, and mind
1. 56. 23; those who listen, without envy, to
the great life (story) of the Bhāratas have
no fear from disease (in this world), and
need have no fear of the next world at all
1. 56. 24; Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana has composed
it which helps to acquire wealth, fame, long
life, heaven and merit 1. 56. 25; the one who
having known it recites it for the Brāhmaṇas
on the पर्वन् days is cleansed of his sins,
wins heaven for himself and becomes one
with Brahman (ब्रह्मभूयं स गच्छति)
1. 56. 28; 18. 5. 35; the sin that one inad-
vertently commits by day in one's activities
disappears if he listens to the Mahābhārata
Ākhyāna 1. 56. 30, or is released from it
by narrating it in the evening 18. 5. 37
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 18. 5. 43: पश्चिमायां
सन्ध्यायां पठ्यते चेद् दिनकृतं पापं
नश्यति); one who recites it for the three
वर्णस् with Brāhmaṇas at their head is
cleansed of his sins, obtains fame and
undoubtedly achieves the greatest perfection
(गच्छेत् परमिकां सिद्धिम्) 18. 5. 43-
44; or one who studies attentively (पठेत्
सुसमाहितः) the Mahābhārata Ākhyāna will
undoubtedly attain the greatest perfection
18. 5. 53. [See Kārṣṇa, Jaya, Bhārata-
sāvitrī]

भारतसावित्री
Bhāratasāvitrī f.: Name of the four
stanzas (18. 5. 47-50) occurring towards
the end of the Mahābhārata 18. 5. 51.
The great sage Vyāsa having composed
in the bygone days this Bhārata Saṃhitā,
taught it to his son along with the four
stanzas 18. 5. 46; contents of these stanzas
(18. 5. 47-50): thousands of parents and
hundreds of sons and wives with whom one
lives in this world pass away and (many)
others will pass away (in future) (47);
only an ignorant, and not a wise person,
experiences day by day thousands of occasions
for delight and hundreds of occasions for
fear (48); here I, (i. e. Vyāsa himself)
with upraised hands, speak loudly (to
people): why do you not practise धर्म
since from it proceed acquisition of profit
and fulfilment of desire (ऊर्ध्वबाहुर्
विरौम्य् एष न च कश्चिच् छृणोति मे।
धर्माद् अर्थश् च कामश् च स किमर्-
थं न सेव्यते॥) (49); one should not
forsake धर्म for the fulfilment of desire,
nor out of fear, nor greed, nor even for
saving one's life; (for), धर्म is eternal,
while happiness and misery are not eternal,
जीव (soul) is eternal its cause (हेतु i. e.
body) is not eternal (न जातु कामान् न
भयान् न लोभाद् धर्मं त्यजेज् जीवि-
तस्यापि हेतोः।नित्यो धर्मः सुखदुःखे
त्व् अनित्ये जीवो नित्यो हेतुर् अस्य त्व् अनित्यः)
(50); one who recites the Bhāratasāvitrī on
waking up in the morning obtains the fruit
of (reciting) the Bhārata and attains the
highest ब्रह्मन् (स भारतफतं प्राप्य
परं ब्रह्माधिगच्छति); (according to
Nīlakaṇṭha on Bom Ed. 18. 5. 60 these
stanzas bring together the essence of the
Bhārata and therefore deserve to be recited
(तत्र पठनयोग्यं भारतसारसं-
ग्रहं चतुःश्लोकीरूपम्).

महोपनिषद्
Mahopaniṣad f.: Name (?) of a sacred
text 6. 114. 12.
(1) Bhīṣma, when he fell down from
his chariot, resorted to Yoga and started
reciting Mahopaniṣad; in that condition he
waited for the arrival of proper time for giv-
ing up his life (महोपनिषदं चैव योगम्
आस्थाय वीर्यवान्।जपञ् शान्तनवो धीमान्
कालाकाङ्क्षी स्थितो ऽभवत्॥) 6. 114. 112;
(2) Bhūriśravas, when his right hand was
cut off by Arjuna, gave up fighting with
Sātyaki and started meditating on the
Mahopaniṣad; he then became a sage engaged
in Yoga (ध्यायन् महोपनिषदं योग-
युक्तो ऽभवन् मुनिः) 7. 118. 18. [See

section (12. 326. 20-99) in the Śāntiparvan
12. 326. 100.

the four Vedas and composed according to
Sāṃkhya and the Yoga, and following the
Pañcarātra (इदं महोपनिषदं चतुर्-
वेदसमन्वितम्।सांख्ययोगकृतं तेन
पञ्चरात्रानुशब्दितम्॥) 12. 326. 100: it
was sung by Nārāyaṇa (नारायणमुखोद्-
गीत 12. 326. 101) to Nārada when he visited
the great Śvetadvīpa (12. 325. 1); in it
Nārāyaṇa is described to Nārada as one eternal
Person, Vāsudeva (एकं पुरुषं वासुदेवं
सनातनम् 12. 326. 31), who is called the
soul of the world (लोकस्यांएति कथ्यते
12. 326. 21) or the soul of all beings
(सर्वभूतात्मभुतो हि वासुदेवः 12. 326.
31); that Puraṣa is devoid of activity and
can be seen only through knowledge; there is
nothing beyond that eternal Puruṣa (पुरुषो
निष्क्रियश् चैव ज्ञानदृश्यश् च कथ्यते
12. 326. 23; अव्यक्तं पुरुषे ब्रह्मन्
निष्क्रिये संप्रलीयते।नास्ति तस्मात् पर-
तरं पुरुषाद् वै सनातनात् 12. 326. 30);
one should know him to be the eternal,
highest self Vāsudeva (12. 326. 24);
he, the क्षेत्रज्ञ, enjoys the three गुणस्
सत्त्व, रजस् and तमस्, but is not
affected by them (12. 326. 27, 21); that
Vāsudeva himself (क्षेत्रज्ञ) is Saṃkar-
ṣaṇa (जीव), from whom arises Pradyumna
(मनस्), and from Pradyumna arises Ani-
ruddha (अहंकार) (12. 326, 38-39; 35-
37, 68-69); all gods and sages resort to him
and the entire world is contained in him
(12. 326, 47-55); his incarnations from
Varāha to Kṛṣṇa are narrated in 12. 326.
71-93; having thus told Nārada all that was
past. and also the future, with its secret the
blessed God disappeared (एतत् ते सर्वम्
आख्यातं ब्रह्मन् भक्तिमतो मया।
पुराणं च भविष्यं च सरहस्यं च
सत्तम॥एवं स भगवान् देवो विश्व-
मूऋतिधरो ऽव्ययः।एतावद् उक्त्वा वचनं
तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥) 12. 326. 97-98;
Nārada narrated what he heard from Nārā-
yaṇa again to Brahman in his abode (नाराय-
णमुखोद्गीतं नारदो ऽस्रावयत् पुनः।
ब्रह्मणः सदने तात यथा दृष्टं यथा

ted to Mātaṅga 5. 125. 19-20.
Duryodhana, when under pressure from
all quarters to come to terms with the
Pāṇḍavas, while replying to Kṛṣṇa quoted
the authority of Mātaṅga in support of the
course of action chosen by him (viz. not
bowing down before the enemy for fear of
losing life); Mātaṅga had said: “One should
rise up and not bow down, for rising up
means manliness; one may break one's bone
(lit. ‘which has no joints’), but not bow
down before any one” (उद्यच्छेद् एव
न नमेद् उद्यमो ह्य् एव पौरुषम्।अप्य्
अपर्वण्त् भज्येत न नमेद् इह कस्यचित्।)
5. 125. 19 (However Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5.
127. 19: अपर्वणि अप्रस्तावे); this dictum
of Mātaṅga is cherished by those who seek
their welfare (इति मातङ्गवचनं परी-
प्सन्ती हितेप्सवः) 5. 125. 20.

पापहरं मया) 3. 185. 53; the Purāṇa
narrates the story of Manu and the fish
3. 185. 1-54; one who always listens to the

becomes happy, all his objectives are ful-
filled, and he goes to heaven 3. 185. 54.

मानवी
Mānavī adj.: of Arthavidyā proclaimed
by Manu 7. 5. 34.
Droṇa, while accepting Duryodhana's
proposal to lead the army after the fall of
Bhīṣma, informed him that besides knowing

यजुर्वेद
Yajurveda m.: Name of one of the
four Vedic Saṃhitās.
A. Relationship with Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa:
Nārāyaṇa, the greatest among the gods, told
the sage Mārkaṇḍeya that the Yajurveda
and the other three Vedas arise from him
(at the beginning) and enter into him (at
the end) (मत्तः प्रादुर्भवन्त्य् एते माम्
एव प्रविशन्ति च) 3. 187. 14; Bhagavān
(Kṛṣṇa) told Arjuna that in the Yajur-
veda and in the other three Vedas the great
sages have listed his many names 12. 328. 8-
9; he also told Arjuna that he was described
in the ritual texts to be the Yajurveda of one
hundred and one branches (षट्पञ्चाशतम्
अष्टौ च सप्तत्रैंशतम् इत्य् उत।यस्मिञ्
शाखा यजुर्वेदे सो ऽहम् आध्वर्यवे
स्मृतः) 12. 330. 33.
B. Personified:

guards (पृष्ठरक्षौ) of the chariot of
Mahādeva (when he got ready to destroy
the Tripuras) 8. 24. 81; (2) Yajurveda,
along with the other Vedas, was seen by
Nārada, waiting on Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva)
in his Sabhā 2. 11. 23, 31. [See Yajus]

यजुस्
Yajus nt. (sg. or pl.): Sacrificial prose
formula from the Yajurveda; when used in
plural it stands also for the Yajurveda; when
in plural, it mostly occurs with ऋच्स् and
सामन्स्।
A. Gift of Āditya to Yājñavalkya:
The sage Yājñavalkya told king Janaka that
while he was practising the prescribed rite,
(although) he was despised (? अवमतेन),
he propitiated the god Sun with severe
austerity; he then received from Āditya the
यजुसेस् (यथार्षेणेह विधिना चरतावम-
तेन ह।मयादित्याद् अवाप्तानि यजूंषि
मिथिलाधिप॥महता तपसा देवस् तपिष्-
ठः सेवितो मया) 12. 306. 2-3; when the
pleased god Sūrya offered a boon to Yājña-
valkya, the latter requested the god to grant
him the यजुसेस् which had not been used
before (? यजूंषि नोपयुक्तानि क्षिप्रम्
इच्छामि वेदितुम्) 12. 306. 4-5; the god
agreed to Yājñavalkya's request; Sarasvatī
then in the form of speech entered Yājña-
valkya's mouth 12. 306. 6-7; the God said
that as a result of that, the whole of Veda
(i. e. the Yajurveda) together with its latter
half and the खिल would be established in
him (Yājñavalkya) (प्रतिष्ठास्यति ते वेदः
सोत्तरः सखिलो द्विजा) 12. 306. 10 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 12. 318. 10: खिलं परशाखीयं
स्वशाख्यायाम् अपेक्षावशात् पठ्यते तत्
खिलम् इत्य् उच्यते। … सखिलम् तत्सहितम्।
सोत्तरं सोपनिषत्कम्।); Yājñavalkya
received fifteen यजुसेस् from Arka (Sūrya)
(दश पञ्च च प्राप्तानि यजूंष्य् अर्कान्
मयानघ) 12. 306. 21; Sūrya gave the
यजुसेस् (to Yājñavalkya) in the east (अत्र
(i. e. in the east) दत्तानि सूर्येण यजूंषि)
5. 106. 11 (Nī on Bom. Ed. 5. 108. 11:
याज्ञवल्क्यायेति शेषः).
B. Relationship
with deities: Nārāyaṇa has his abode in the
ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and the सामन्स् (ऋग्यजुः-
सामधामानम्) 12. 47. 27; Bhīṣma while
praising Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa said that he was
of the nature of a स्तोत्र and, as a bird
named Yajus, had metres for its limbs,
Trivṛt (स्तोम) for its head, and Ratha-
ntara and Bṛhatī sāmans for its eyes (यः
सुपर्णो यजुर् नाम छन्दोगात्रस् त्रि-
वृच्छिराः।रथन्तरबृहत्यक्षस् तस्मै
स्तोत्रात्मने नमः॥) 12. 47. 28; (Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 47. 44: सु-
पर्णः वेदपुरुषःअ यजुर् इति यस्य नाम
छन्दांसि गायत्र्यादीनी यस्य गात्राणि हस्-
तादीनि।त्रिवृत् त्रिभिर् ऋग्यजुःसामभिर् वर्-
तत इति योगाद् यज्ञाः स एव शिरो यस्य।
यस्य रथन्तरं बृहच् च वैकल्पिकं
साम प्रीतिवाक्यम्); (2) Upamanyu while
praising Śiva said that he was Śatarudriya
among the यजुसेस् 13. 14. 159.
C. यजुस्
and sacrifice (real or metaphorical): The
sage Taṇḍi while praising Mahādeva said
that the Adhvaryu priests give offerings to
him in sacrifice with the repetition of यजुस्
formulae 13. 16. 48; Trita, fallen in a well,
mentally thought of the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and
the सामन्स् for offering a Soma sacrifice
(ऋचो यजूंषी सामानि मनसा चिन्तयन्
मुनिः) 9. 35. 33; the Yakṣa asked Yudhi-
ṣṭhira: “which is the one यजुस् suited for
sacrifice ?” (किम् एकं यज्ञ्यं यजुः);
the reply was: “mind is the (one) यजुस्
suitable for sacrifice” (मनो वै यज्ञियं
यजुः) 3. 297. 34-35; one who dwells in a
forest (वानप्रस्थाश्रमे वसेत् 12. 236. 5)
should, till death, give five (offerings) to the
प्राणस् in the three fires in himself with the
यजुस् formula, (and) eat six (morsels) with-
out criticizing (the food) 12. 236. 25 (त्रींस्
चैवाग्नीन् यजेत् सम्यग् आत्मन्य् एवात्म-
मोक्षणात् (?)।प्राणेभ्यो यजुषा पञ्च षट्
प्राश्नीयाद् अकुत्सयन्॥ Nī., however, on
Bom. Ed. 12. 244. 26: ‘हृदयं गार्ह-
पत्यो मोनो ऽन्वाहार्यपचन आस्यम् आह-
वनीयः’ इति वैश्वानरविद्योक्तप्रकारेण
आत्ममोक्षणाद् देहपातावधि आत्मनि देहे
एवाग्नीन् यजेत् … यजुष उच्चारणानन्तरम्
पञ्च ग्रासान् प्राश्नीयात् षड् वा।अकुत्सयन्
अन्नम् अनिन्दन्).
D. यजुस् and meat-
eating: One who eats meat which is sancti-
fied by the यजुस् formula (i. e. sacrificial
meat) incurs no sin (यजुषा संस्कृतं
मांसम् उपभुञ्जन् न दुष्यति) 13. 148.
17; consecration by the यजुस् formula is
extended even to ordinary food which does
not involve killing (नात्मार्थं पाचयेद्
अन्नं न वृथा घातयेत् पशून्।प्राणी वा
यदि वाप्राणी संस्कारं यजुषार्हति) 12.
235. 5 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 243.
6: प्राणी छागादिः अप्राणी अश्वथादिः
यजुषा छेदनमन्त्रेणैव क्रत्वर्थम् एव
संस्कारम् अर्हति न तु भक्षणमात्रा-
र्थम्); according to 12. 186. 13, however,
one who has abstained from meat should
not eat (even) meat which is sanctified by
the यजुस् formula (i. e. should not eat even
sacrificial meat) (यजुषा संस्कृतं मांसम्
निवृत्तो मांसभक्षणात्।न भक्षयेत्;
Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 193. 14: यजुषा
यजुर्वेदविदाध्वर्युणा मांसम् यज्ञ्यम्
अपि निवृत्तो न भक्षयेत्).
E. The study
of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स्: One who does
not know the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and the
सामन्स् is to be considered as a calamity
brought about by Prajāpati (अनृग्यजुर्
असामा तु प्राजापत्य उपद्रवः) 12. 60. 42
(Commentator Vimalabodha: अनृग्यजुर्
असामा ऋग्वेदादिशून्यः प्राजापत्य उप-
द्रवः विधातृकृत उपद्रवः उपघातः।
एवंविधो ब्राह्मणो निष्फलजन्मेति भावः
cited in the footnote to the stanza in the Cr.
Ed.; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 60. 44:
शूद्रेण उपद्रवतीति तत्समीपगामित्वाद्
उपद्रवो दासः शूद्रः स वेदहीनो ऽपि
प्राजापत्यः प्रजापतिदेवताकः यथाग्नेयो
ब्राह्मण ऐन्द्रोः क्षत्रियस् तद्वत्).
F.
Personified: यजुसेस् in thousands in the
bodily form attended the sacrifice of Mahā-
deva who had assumed the body of Varuṇas
13. 85. 4.
G. Limitations: Hanūmān
told Bhīma that in the Kṛta age there were
no सामन्स्, यजुसेस् अन्द् ऋच्स् (नासन् कृतयुगे
तात … न सामयजुऋग्वर्णाः) 3. 148. 12-13
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 14: त्रयीध-
र्मस्य चित्तशुद्ध्यर्थत्वात् तस्याश् च
तदानीम् स्वभावसिद्धत्वान् न सामादीन्य्
आसन्) [for other information on यजुस् which
is common to the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and the
सामन्स् see Ṛc above].

Śatapatha nt.: Name of a Vedic text
belonging to the White Yajurveda.
Described as a new Veda (lit. ‘which
did not exist before’) (वेदम् अपूर्वम्) 12.
306. 23; God Sūrya blessed Yājñavalkya
with a boon and told him that goddess
Sarasvatī, in the form of speech, would enter
his body; he then asked Yājñavalkya to open
his mouth (सरस्वतीह वाग्भूता शरीरं
ते प्रवेक्ष्यति।ततो माम् आह भगवान्
आस्यं स्वं विवृतं कुरु।) 12. 306. 6-7;
Yājñavalkya was then to promulgate
the entire Śatapatha at the end of which
activity his mind would seek liberation
(कृत्स्नं शतपथं चैव प्रणेष्यसि द्वि-
जर्षभ।तस्यान्ते चापुनर्भावे बुद्धिस्
तव भविष्यति) 12. 306. 11; (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 12. 319. 11: अपुनर्भावे मोक्षे); later,
Yājñavalkya meditated on Sarasvatī and when
the goddess, adorned with vowels and conso-
nants, flashed before him, he offered her and
the god Sūrya a guest offering; he then
composed with great delight the entire Śata-
patha along with its secrets, and abstracts,
and supplements; he taught it to his hundred
pupils (ततः शतपथं कृत्स्नं सर-
हस्यं ससंग्रहम्।चक्रे सपरिशेषं
च हर्षेण परमेण च॥कृत्वा चाध्यय-
नं तेषां शिष्याणां शतम् उत्तमम्) 12.
306. 16-17; Yājñavalkya embarked on this
activity keeping before his mind the seed (in
the form of the fifteen यजुसेस् which he had
obtained from god Sun (दश पञ्च च
प्राप्तानि यजूंष्य अर्कान् मयानघ 12.
306. 21) and goddess Sarasvatī, and on
the strength of the authority conferred on
him by god Sūrya (बीजम् एतत् पुरस्कृत्य
देवीम् चैव सरस्वतीम्।सूर्यस्य चानु-
भावेन प्रवृत्तो ऽहं नराधिप॥) 12.
306. 22; he taught the whole of it to his
pupils and established fifteen branches of
learning revealed to him by Bhāskara (god
Sūrya) 12. 306. 24-25; a passage to the effect
that ‘if one who knows (the real significance)
gives an offering as a gift in the mouth of
a Brāhmaṇa it is as good as giving an
offering in kindled fire’ is supposed to occur
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (शतपथे हि
ब्राह्मणं भवति।अग्नौ समिद्धे स
जुहोति यो विद्वान् ब्राह्मणमुखे दाना-
हुतिं जुहोति) 12. 329. 8.

सामन्
Sāman nt. (mostly plural): Stands for
the Sāmaveda, or a hymn or stanzas of that
Veda (in this sense it often occurs along with
ऋच् and यजुस्); a melody in which the stanzas
of the Sāmaveda are sung.
A. Relationship with Bhagāvān: Bhaga-
vān told Arjuna that those who knew the
Veda called him the Sāmaveda of a thousand
branches (मां प्रचक्षते।सहस्रशाखं
यत् साम ये वै वेदविदो जनाः) 12. 330.
32; in the stanzas of the Sāmaveda, as in the
other three Vedas and many other texts, many
names of Bhagavān have been enumerated by
the great sages (ऋग्वेदे सयजुर्वेदे तथै-
वाथर्वसामसु। … बहूनि मम नामानि
कीर्तितानि महर्षिभिः) 12. 328. 8.
B. Sing-
ing of सामन् as daily routine: The आश्रम
of Dadhīca on the other bank of Sarasvatī
hummed with the sound of bees as with the
chantings of सामन्- singers (षट्पदोद्गीत-
निनदैर् विघुष्ट्ं सामगैर् इव) 3. 98. 13;
on the Gandhamādana mountain the Pāṇḍavas
could hear the sound of the songs and of the
clapping of hands (by the Gandharvas and the
Kiṃpuruṣas) which sounded like the melody
of the सामन् chants (गीतानां तलतालानां
यथा साम्नां च निस्वनः) 3. 155. 84; the
precincts of the आश्रम of Upamanyu
resounded with the auspicious melodies of
सामन्-singers (शुभैः सामगानां
च वीर) 13. 14. 35.
C. Employment
in sacrifices: In the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira
the six fires were piled up with the chanting
of सामन् by those who had observed the
vows (साम्ना षडग्नयो यस्मिंश् चीयन्ते
संशितव्रतैः) 2. 12. 13; in this sacrifice
Susāman, the chief of the Dhanaṃjayas,
acted as the chanter of the सामन्स् 2. 30. 34
(धनंजयानां ऋषभः सुसामा सामगो
ऽभवत्।) Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 33. 34:
धनंजयानां धनंजयगोत्राणां म-
ध्ये श्रेष्ठः सुसामा नाम आङ्गिरसः);
in the sacrifice of Janaka the excellent Ukthya
sāman was sung 3. 134. 36; Bhīṣma told
Yudhiṣṭhira that in a sacrifice the सामन्-
singers praise employing the Rathantara
melody (रथन्तरे सामगाश् च स्तुवन्ति)
13. 143. 15; Ṛṣi Gṛtsamada told Yudhiṣṭhira
that once, when Indra's long sacrificial session
lasting for a thousand years was in progress,
Vasiṣṭha, the son of Manu Cākṣuṣa, found
fault the way Gṛtsamada was singing the
Rathantara chant; Vasiṣṭha asked Gṛtsamada
to set his jubilation aside and again think
over what he had done (रथन्तरं द्विज-
श्रेष्ठ न सम्यग् इति वर्तते।समीक्षस्व
पुनर् बुद्ध्या हर्षं त्यक्त्वा द्विजोत्तम);
(he charged Gṛtsamada that by his in-
correct singing he had committed a sin which
would not carry the sacrifice to the gods;
for this fault Gṛtsamada was cursed to be
a deer) 13. 18. 15-17; Vālmīki told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that in a certain dispute regarding
सामन् (-chanting) the sages pronounced the
judgement that Vasiṣṭha had incurred the sin
of killing a Brāhmaṇa and he was instantly
seized by that sin (वीवादे साम्नि मुनिभिर्
ब्रह्मघ्नो वै भवान् इति।उक्तः क्षणेन
चाविष्टस् तेनाधर्मेण भारत) 13. 18. 7.
Trita, when he wanted to offer a sacrifice in
the well, thought of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स्
for using them in the rites 9. 35. 33; in the
metaphorical sacrifice (संग्रामयज्ञ 12.
99. 12) performed by a warrior (i. e. in a
war) the words ‘cut, break’ uttered by the
fighters in a war serve the purpose of the
सामन्स् chanted by the सामन्- singers in the
abode of Yama (cf. the next section D)
(छिन्धि भिन्धीति यस्यैतच् छ्रूयते वाहिनी-
मुखे।सामानि सामगास् तस्य गायन्ति
यमसादने) 12. 99. 22; सामन्स् were sung
when formerly animals were bound for god
Nārāyaṇa—this is mentioned in the ऋच्स्
recited by those who know Nārāyaṇa and
these are cited as an instance (ऋचश् चाप्य्
अत्र शंसन्ति नारायणविदो जनाः नारा-
यनाय देवाय यद् अब्दह्नन् पशून् पुरा॥
तत्र सामानि गायन्ति तानि चाहुर् निदर्श-
नम्॥) 14. 25. 16-17 (see however Nī. cited
under ऋच् p. 175. 2 above).
D. Employ-
ment in funeral rites: When the Pāṇḍavas
set out for the forest Dhaumya, their Puro-
hita, accompanied them chanting on the way
the terrible सामन्स् addressed to Yama and
holding in his hand कुश grass directed to-
wards the Nairṛtya direction (धौम्यो
याम्यानि सामानि रौद्राणि च विशां पते।
गायन् गच्छति मार्गेषु कुशान् आदाय
पाणिना॥) 2. 71. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 80.
7: याम्यानि यमदैवत्यानि); (कृत्वा तु
नैरृतान् दर्भान् धीरो धौम्यः पुरो-
हितः।सामानि गायन् याम्यानि पुरतो याति
भारत) 2. 71. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 80.
22: नैरृतान् निरृतिकोणगान्); he thereby
wanted to indicate that when the Bhāratas will
be killed in the war the priests of the Kurus
will similarly chant the सामन्स् (addressed to
Yama) 2. 71. 22; at the cremation of Droṇa
the सामन्-singers sang three सामन्स् when
his body was placed on the funeral pyre
(द्रोणम् आधाय गायन्ति त्रीणि सामानि
सामगाः) 11. 23. 38; when the pyre was lit,
others followed them reciting the three सामन्स्
in subdued voices (see Cr. Ed. Vol. 12.
p. 119 note on 11. 23. 41) (सामभिस् त्रिभिर्
अन्तःस्थैर् अनुशंसन्ति चापरे।अग्नाव्
अग्निम् इवाधाय द्रोणं हुत्वा हुताशने)
11. 23. 41; सामन्स् were sung at the Pitṛ-
medha rites of some of those fallen in the war;
due to the sound of the सामन्स् and the ऋच्स्,
as also due to the lamentations of women, all
beings were stupefied during the night (पितृ-
मेधाश् च केषांचिद् अवर्तन्त महात्मनाम्।
सामभिश् चाप्य् अगायन्त … ॥ साम्नां ऋचां
च नादेन स्त्रीणां च रुदितस्वनैः।कश्म-
लं सर्वभूतानां निशायाम् समपद्यत)
11. 26. 39-40; at the Pitṛmedha rites of
Bhīṣma the सामन्-singers sang the chants
13. 154. 12; during the Pitṛmedha rites, at
the cremation of Vasudeva, when the funeral
pyre was lit there was a loud sound produced
by the सामन्-singers (सामगानां च
निर्घोषः) 16. 8. 23, 25-26.
E. Use in
the praise of deities: (1) Indra: Arjuna saw
Indra praised by excellent द्विजस् with praises
consisting of ऋच्स्, यजुसेस् and सामन्स् 3. 44.
18; when Arjuna and Indra sat on the same
throne, Gandharvas led by Tumburu, skilled
in songs and chants, sang गाथास् in very
agreeable melody (तत्र स्म गाथा गायन्ति
साम्ना परमवल्गुना।गन्धर्वास् तुम्बु-
रुश्रेष्ठाः कुशला गीतसामसु) 3. 44. 28;
(2) Kubera: On the Gandhamādana
mountain the sound of सामन्- singing by
Tumburu, who waits on Dhanada (Kubera)
was heard on the junctions of the four changes
of the moon (पर्वसधिषु) 3. 156. 28;
(3) Śiva: Upamanyu in his praise of Śiva
said that the god was sung with chants by the
सामन्-singers (सामभिर् यं च गायन्ति
सामगाः शुद्धबुद्धयः) 13. 16. 49;
Śatakratu (Indra) and Viṣṇu (who are the
two sons of Aditi), and god Brahman sing the
Rathantara melody near Bhava (Śiva) (शत-
क्रतुस् च भगवान् विष्णुश् चादितिनन्दनौ।
ब्रह्मा रथन्तरं साम ईरयन्ति भावा-
न्तिके) 13. 15. 16; (however, the Editor's note,
Cr. Ed. Vol. 17, p. 1061 on 13. 15. 16, says:
अदितिनन्दनौ = Mitra and Varuṇa ?) (4)
Deity not named: in the south, in the bowers
of Mandara mountain and in the houses of
the Viprarṣis, the Gandharvas sing enchanting
गाथास् sung in different melodies (गन्ध-
र्वा गान्ति गाथा वै चित्तबुद्धिहरा द्विज।
अत्र सामानि गाथाभिः श्रुत्वा गीतानि॥)
5. 107. 9-10.
F. Importance: While des-
cribing his विभूतिस्, Bhagavān told Arjuna
that he was the Bṛhatsāman chant among the
melodies (बृहत्साम् तथा साम्नाम्) 6. 32.
35; Bhīṣma praised Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa, who is
sung in सामन्स् that are true, as one whose
actions are true and who is truth (यं …
गृणन्ति सत्यकर्माणं सत्यं सत्येषु
सामसु) 12. 47. 16 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 47. 26: गृणन्ति ध्यायन्ति सत्यम् अबा-
धितं सत्येषु अबाधितार्थेषु सामसु
ज्येष्ठसामादिषु).
G. Personfication:
The Sāmans along with the Yajuses and the
Ṛgveda, in bodily form, attended the sacrifice
of Mahādeva (Śiva) who had assumed the
form of Varuṇa (मूर्तिमन्ति च सामानि
यजूंषि च सहस्रश्ः।ऋग्वेदश् चागमत्
तत्र) 13. 85. 4, (देवस्य महतस् तात
वारुणीं बिभ्रतस् तनुम्) 13. 85. 2, (आज-
ग्मुः … यज्ञं पशुपतेः प्रीता वरुणस्य
महात्मनः) 13. 85. 7-8.
H. Mystic
interpretation: The Yakṣa asked Yudhi-
ṣṭhira: “What is the one सामन् suited for
sacrifice ?” Yudhiṣṭhira replied: “Prāṇa is
the one सामन् suited for sacrifice” (किम्
एकम् यज्ञियं साम) 3. 297. 34, (प्राणो वै
यज्ञियं साम) 3. 297. 35; Bhīṣma declared
to Yudhiṣṭhira: There was but one सामन्
(एकं साम) 12. 60. 45 (Nī. on 12. 60
47: अकारो वै सर्वा वाक् सैषा स्पर्शोष्म-
भिर् व्यज्यमाना भवी नानारूपा भवतीति
श्रुतेर् एकं अकाररूपम् एव अक्षरं
यथा सामादिरूपं)
I. Relationship
with Yugas: According to Hanūmant there
were neither सामन्स्, यजुसेस् nor ऋच्स् in the
Kṛtayuga (नासन् कृतयुगे तात … न साम-
यजुऋग्वर्णाः) 3. 148. 12-13 (See Nīla-
kaṇṭha on this passage cited under Yajus
p. 207. 1; for such other information common
to ऋच्स् and यजुसेस् see Ṛc, especially 3. 27.
3; 5. 43. 1-3; 5. 44. 21; 6. 31. 17; 12. 52.
22; 12. 60. 42; 12. 194. 8; 12. 199. 16-
18; 12. 224. 63; 12. 227. 1; 12. 230. 8; 12.
243. 2; 12. 260. 26, 36; 12. 297. 15; 12.
322. 37). [See Sāmaveda]

सामवेद
Sāmaveda m.: Name of one of the
four Vedic Saṃhitās.
A. Relationship with Kṛṣṇa Nārāyaṇa:
Nārāyaṇa told the sage Mārkaṇḍeya that the
Sāmaveda, along with the other three Vedas,
arise from him and enter into him (मत्तः
प्रादुर्भवन्त्य् एते माम् एव प्रविशन्ति च)
3. 187. 14.
B. Importance: (1) In
the Vibhūtiyoga of the Gītā, Bhagavān told
Arjuna that he was the Sāmaveda of the
(four) Vedas (वेदानाम् सामवेदो ऽस्मि)
6. 32. 22; (2) Upamanyu, in his praise of
Śiva, described Śiva as the Sāmaveda of the
(four) Vedas (सामवेदश् च वेदानाम्)
13. 14. 159; (3) The धर्म of the एका-
न्तिन्स् (12. 336. 7, 57), expounded by Nārada
for the benefit of Yudhiṣṭhira, was equal to
the Sāmaveda and was preserved by god
Nārāyaṇa himself (गहनो ह्य् एष धर्मो
वै … संमितः सामवेदेन।धार्यते
स्वयम् ईशेन राजन् नारायणेन ह॥)
(12. 336. 9-10); this धर्म was learnt
and taught by Brahman to the Barhiṣad
sages from whom it went to a द्विज called
Jyeṣṭha who was versed in the Sāmaveda
(अऋहीतो ब्रह्मणा राजन् … अध्यापिताश् च
मुनयो नाम्ना बर्हिषदो नृप॥बर्हिष-
द्भ्यश् च संक्रान्तः सामवेदान्तगं
द्विजम्।ज्येष्ठं नाम्नाभिविख्यातम् … )
12. 336. 41-42.
C. Personified: (1)
Sāmaveda, along with the Ṛgveda and the
Purāṇas, moved in front of the chariot of
Śiva when he got ready to destroy the
Tripuras 8. 24. 80; (2) Sāmaveda, along
with the other three Vedas, visit the Sabhā
of Brahmadeva 2. 11. 23.
D. Limita-
tions: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Sanatsujāta
whether one who committed sin was absolved
of it if he studied the Sāmaveda (and the
ऋच्स् and यजुसेस्) 5. 43. 1 (the reply was in
the negative 5. 43. 2). [See Sāman]

सारस्वत
Sārasvata nt.: Name of the 77th
पर्वन् in the list of a hundred sub-पर्वन्स्
of the Bhārata supposed to have been made
by Vyāsa in the Parvasaṃgraha 1. 2. 60,
33, 70.
Described as detailing the merits of a
group of तीर्थस् (तीर्थवंशगुणान्वित) 1.
2. 60; referred to while listing the contents of
the Śalyaparvan as one in which was describ-
ed the holiness of river Sarasvatī and of the
तीर्थस् (सरस्वत्याश् च तीर्थानां पुण्यता
परिकीर्तिता) 1. 2. 175; related to the
अध्यायस् 9. 29-53 (called Tīrthayātrā-
parvan in the colophon; actually this पर्वन्
precedes the Gadāyuddhaparvan and does not
follow it as stated in 1. 2. 60 (गदायुद्धम्
अतः परम्।सारस्वतं ततः पर्व) and
in 1. 2. 175).

सावित्री
Sāvitrī1 f.: Name of a मन्त्र (ṚV,
3. 62. 10) so called because it is related to
god Savitṛ; also called Gāyatrī (3. 83. 27:
6. 5. 18-19) because the मन्त्र is composed
in the Gāyatrī metre.
A. Description: holy (पुण्या) 6. 5. 18;
best (उत्तमा) 13. 145. 27; having all quali-
ties (सर्वगुणान्विता) 6. 5. 18; enabling the
reciter to get over difficult situations (दुर्ग-
तरणी) 2. 11. 25; highly honoured in the
worlds (लोकसंमता) 6. 5. 18.
B. Im-
portance and significance: Sāvitrī was con-
sidered to be the beginning of all sciences
(आदिर् इष्यते।सावित्री सर्वविद्यानाम्) 14.
44. 4-5; the nineteen classes of beings (7
ग्राम्य पशुस्, 7 आरण्य पशुस्, 5 उद्-
भिज्जस्) and the five महाभूतस्, which
make a total of twenty-four are identi-
fied with (the twenty-four syllables of) the
Gāyatrī (एषां विंशतिर् एकोना महाभूतेषु
पञ्चसु।चतुर्विंशतिर् उद्दिष्टा गायत्री
लोकसंमता॥) 6. 5. 15-18.
C. Its
close association with the Vedas used for
a simile: As the Sāvitrī मन्त्र does not
forsake the Vedas, so did Yājñasenī (Drau-
padī) not forsake the Pāṇḍavas 3. 80. 4.
D. Relationship with deities: (1) Savitṛ:
Sāvitrī was (first) pronounced in the east by
god Savitṛ to the ब्रह्मवादिन्स् 5. 106. 10;
3. 110. 5 (? सावित्रीं सविता यथा (ददौ));
(2) Nārāyaṇa: On the Śveta Dvīpa, Nārada
saw ॐकार, followed by Sāvitrī, coming out
of the mouth of Nārāyaṇa 12. 326. 7; (3)
Śiva: when Rudra got ready to destroy the
Tripuras he made the Vedas his bow and the
Sāvitrī मन्त्र his bow-string 13 145. 27;
E. Personification: (1) Sāvitrī, in bodily
form, present in the Sabhā of Brahmadeva 2.
11. 25; Sāvitrī, along with the Vedas and the
Upaniṣads attended the sacrifice of Śiva when
he had assumed the form of Varuṇa 13. 85. 6.
F. Uses: (1) In श्राद्ध: One should atten-
tively recite the Sāvitrī prayer at each oblation
given to the manes at the श्राद्ध (ब्रूयाच्
छ्राद्धे च सावित्रीं पिण्डे पिण्डे समा-
हितः) 13. 92. 14; (cf. Śāṅkh Gṛ. Sū. 4. 1. 8
for a slightly different use: भुञ्जानेषु
महाव्याहृतीः सावित्रीम् मधुवातीयाः पितृ-
देवत्याः पावमानीश् च जपेत्); (2) for use
as a test (?): If a person born of a mixture of
castes recites Gāyatrī at the renowned तीर्थ
called Gāyatryāḥ sthānam it sounds like a
गाथा (a non-Vedic stanza) or an ordinary
song. This was a direct proof available for a
Brāhmaṇa to prove that he was not of mixed
origin (निदर्शनं च प्रत्यक्षं ब्राह्-
मणानां नराधिप।गायत्रीं पठते यस्
तु योनिसंकरजस् तथा।गाथा वा गीतिका
वापि तस्य संपद्यते नृप॥ Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 3. 85. 29: निदर्शानम् उदा-
हरणम्); (3) As a benediction: Jāmbavatī
invoked Sāvitrī mantra for the protection
of Kṛṣṇa when he set out for the Himavant
to meet Śiva (सावित्री ब्रह्मविद्या च ऋतवो
वत्सराः क्षपाः। … रक्षन्तु सर्वत्र गतं
त्वाम् यादव सुखावहम्॥ 13. 14. 22-23).
G. Qualifications and rewards obtained by
its knowledge and recitation: Brāhmaṇas who
know Sāvitrī, so also the one who recites
Sāvitrī three times a day, are worthy of being
invited for a श्राद्ध (सावित्रीज्ञाः क्रिया-
वन्तस् ते राजन् केतनक्षमाः) 13. 24. 25,
(सावित्रीं जपते यस् तु त्रिकालम् … स राजन्
केतनक्षमः) 13. 24. 28; one who recites
Sāvitrī on a sacred spot, eating limited food,
not injuring others, alert (? अमन्दकः), not
talking to any one is freed of all sins 12. 36.
33 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 35. 37:
मन्द इव मन्दकः रागद्वेषमानाप-
मानशून्यः); one who knows the real nature
of Gāyatrī (i. e. the identification of its 24
syllables with 19 kinds of beings and 5
महाभूतस्) is never deprived of the world
due to him (य एतां वेद गायत्रीं …
तत्त्वेन भरतश्रेष्ठ स लोकान् न प्रण-
श्यति) 6. 5. 19. [See Sāvitrī2, Bhārata-
sāvitrī]

सावित्री
Sāvitrī2 f.: Name of a मन्त्र related
to god Savitṛ.
The मन्त्र is recited in the ceremony to

माता सावित्री पिता त्व् आचार्य उच्यते) 3. 177. 29
(cf. Āśva. Gṛ. Sū. 1. 15. 1: प्र ते ददामि
मधुनो घृतस्य वेदं सवित्रा प्रसूतं
मघोनाम्।आयुष्मान् गुप्तो देवताभिह्
शतं जीव शरदो लोके अस्मिन्; Śāṅkh. Gṛ.

Referred to in the list of the contents of
the Ādiparvan as ‘where at Dvārakā the

पर्वन् among the eighteen major पर्वन्स्
of the Bhārata 1. 2. 178, 188.
Described as dreadful (दारुण) 1. 2.
178; its contents are summarized as follows:
where Duryodhana, whose thighs were
broken, was approached after the Pāṇḍavas
had left, by Kṛtavarman, Kṛpa and Drauṇi
(Aśvatthāman); where the enraged Drauṇi
vowed that he would not take off his armour
unless he had killed all the Pāñcālas led by
Dhṛṣtadyumna and the Pāṇḍavas with their
house attendants (अहत्वा सर्वपाञ्चालान्
धृष्टद्युम्नपुरोगमान्।पाण्डवांश् च
सहामात्यान् न विमोक्ष्यामि दंशनम्) 1.
2. 180; where the trio, led by Drauṇi, killed
the Pāñcālas and their attendants while they
were confidently asleep at night; where the
five Pāṇḍavas and Sātyaki were saved as
they were protected by the might of Kṛṣṇa
(कृष्णबलाश्रयात् 1. 2. 182) and all the
rest perished; where Draupadī, grieved by
the death of her sons, and pained at the
killing of her father and brothers, resolved
to fast unto death; where, at the instance
of Draupadī, Bhīma pursued Aśvatthāman;
where Aśvatthāman, afraid of Bhīmasena,
released the missile (Brahmaśiras) against
him saying it was for the destruction of the
Pāṇḍava’ (अपाण्डवायेति रुषा द्रौणिर्
अस्त्रम् अवासृजत् 1. 2. 185); but Kṛṣṇa,
wanting to neutralize (the effect of) those
words said ‘let that not happen’ (मैवम्
इत्य् अब्रवीत् कृष्णः शमयंस् तस्य तद्
वचः 1. 2. 186); whereupon Phālguna
(Arjuna) neutralized Aśvatthāman's missile
by his missile (Brahmaśiras) (यत्रास्त्रम्
अस्त्रेण च तच् छमयाम् आस फाल्गुनः
1. 2. 186); Aśvatthāman, (Kṛṣṇa) Dvai-
pāyana and others uttered curses provoked
by one another (द्रौणिद्वैपायनादीनां
शापाश् चान्योन्यकारिताः) 1. 2. 187); where
the oblations of water to all kings (killed in
the war) were offered (तोयकर्माणि सर्वेषां
राज्ञाम् उदकदानिके 1. 2. 187); where Pṛthā
(Kuntī) narrated the birth of her son who
was secretly born 1. 2. 188; the high-souled
sage of infinite intelligence (Vyāsa) has
declared that the Sauptika and the Aiṣilka
parvans together (सौप्तिकैषीकसंबन्धे)
have eighteen अध्यायस् and he has counted
the श्लोकस् to be eight hundred and seventy
1. 2. 189-190; the पर्वन् (? or the incident
described in it ?) is referred to by Sātyaki
while blaming Kṛtavarman who, in association
with the son of Droṇa (Aśvatthāman), killed
those who were asleep (सौप्तिके ये च निहताः
सुप्तानेन दुरात्मना॥द्रोणपुत्रसहायेन
पापेन कृतवर्मणा) 16. 4. 25-26.

आख्यान।
Mentioned while listing the contents of
the Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 106; related to

स्तवराज
Stavarāja m.: Name (?) of a collect-
ion of names (नामसंहारम् 13. 17. 1;
नामसमुद्देशम् 13. 17. 12, 11) of Śiva
13. 17. 21; these are one thousand and
eight names of Śarva 13. 17. 29; the names
are listed in 13. 17. 30-150.
A. Original composer and transmission:
Originally Brahmā sang the Stava (यत्
पुरा लोककृज् जगौ) 13. 16. 66; यद् उक्तं
पद्मयोनिना 13. 17. 12) and himself
preserved the Stava of Bhagavān (Śiva)
(स्तवम् एतं भगवतो ब्रह्मा स्वयम्
अधारयत्) 13. 17. 164; 13. 17. 154; 13.
17. 5; 13. 16. 66; from him it went
successively to Śakra (Indra) and others 13.
17. 164-168; one of the receivers in this
line was Taṇḍi who obtained it in the abode
of Brahman after he had performed severe
austerities 13. 17. 165; he handed it over to
Śukra Bhārgava 13. 16. 66; 13. 16. 75 (?);
at the end of the line of transmission stood
Mārkaṇḍeya who taught it to Upamanyu
when the latter had observed certain rules
(मार्कण्डेयान् मया प्राप्तं नियमेन
जनार्दन 13. 17. 169) and Upamanyu
gave it to Janārdana (Kṛṣṇa) 13. 17. 168-
169; 13. 17. 1, 5-6; since, in bygone days,
it was once taught by Taṇḍi it also came
to be looked upon as composed by Taṇḍi;
moreover Taṇḍi had brought it down from
heaven to this world (यस्मात् तण्डिः पुरा
प्राह तेन तण्डिकृतो ऽभवत्।स्वर्गाच्
चैवात्र भूलोकं तण्डिना ह्य् अवतारि-
तः॥) 13. 17. 22; 13. 16. 66. 75; 13. 17.
3; the Stavarāja was brought down (to
this world) from the Brahmaloka 13. 17.
21, 4; Upamanyu is also said to have
received it directly from Taṇḍi (तण्डिर्
आख्यातवान् मम।नामानि) 13. 16. 73,
72.
B. Activity of Upamanyu: Pitāmaha
(Brahmadeva) had mentioned ten thousand
names of Sarva (Śiva) in the Vedas and
one thousand names of Śarva (Śiva) in the
Śāstras (दश नामसहस्राणि वेदेष्व् आह
पितामहः।शर्वस्य शास्त्रेषु तथा दश
नामशतानि वै॥) 13. 16. 74; 13. 17. 13;
Upamanyu made an abridgement (in the
form of Stavarāja) out of the ten thousand
names as one churns घृत from curds
(नाम्नां कंचित् समुद्देशं वक्ष्ये ह्य्
अव्यक्तयोनिनः … दश नामसकस्राणि यान्य्
आह प्रपितामहः।तानि निर्मथ्य मनसा
दध्नो घृतम् इवोद्धृतम्) 13. 17. 11, 13.
(for other similes cf. 13. 17. 14); Upa-
manyu gave to Kṛṣṇa this form of the
स्तव, which constituted Mahādeva's (Śiva's)
चरित, having fewer words (and syllables)
and being concise in meaning (किं तु दे-
वस्य महतः संक्षिप्तार्थपदाक्षरम्।
शक्तितश् चरितं वक्ष्ये) 13. 17. 9; this
abridged form looked upon as the essence of
the original (तथैतत् सारम् उद्धृतम्)
13. 17. 14.
C. Its name: After its
composition Brahmā destined it to be the
king of all the divine स्तवस्; since then
it came to be known as Stavarāja of
Īśvara (सर्वस्तवानां दिव्यानां राजत्वे
समकल्पयत्॥तदाप्रभृति चैवायम् ईश्व-
रस्य महात्मनः।स्तवराजेति वीख्यातः)
13. 17. 20-21.
D. Description: The
best of all स्तवस् (स्तवानाम् उत्तमं
स्तवम्) 13. 17. 19, 23; famous (विश्रुत)
13. 17. 169; excellent (प्रवर) 13. 17. 4;
of the first rank (प्रथम) 13. 17. 4;
associated with the four vedas (चतुर्वेद-
समन्वित) 13. 17. 15; means of purifying
(पावन) 13. 17. 15; (पवित्र) 13. 17. 19;
destroyer of all sins (सर्वपापामापह) 13.
17. 15; (सर्वपापप्रणाशन) 13. 17. 23;
killer of demons (रक्षोघ्न) 13. 17. 15;
auspicious (मङ्गल) 13. 17. 19; holy
(शुभ) 13. 17. 4; the best among auspicious
(सर्वमङ्गलमङ्गल्य) 13. 17. 23; holy
(पुण्य) 13. 17. 19; most beneficial
(कल्याणम् उत्तमम्) 13. 17. 19; leading
to heaven (स्वर्ग्य) 13. 17. 4, 169; giving
calmness of mind (शान्तिद) 13. 17. 15; con-
ferring health (आरोग्य), long life (आयुष्य),
wealth (धन्य) and strength (बल्य) 13.
17. 169; conferring welfare (पौष्टिक) 13.
17. 15; beneficial to all beings (सर्वभूत-
हित) 13. 17. 4; looked upon as the highest
ब्रह्मन् (परमं ब्रह्म) 13. 17. 154;
13. 16. 66, as eternal ब्रह्मन् (ब्रह्म सना-
तनम्) 13. 17. 6.
E. Importance: This
Stavarāja is equal to meditation, practice of
Yoga, the best thing to meditate on; it
deserves to be recited; it is itself knowledge
and the highest secret; if one knows it even
at the end of one's life one can attain the
highest state after life (इदं ध्यानम्
इदं योगम् इदं ध्येयम् अनुत्तमम्।
इदं जप्यम् इदं ज्ञानं रहस्यम् इदम्
उत्तमम्।इदं ज्ञात्वान्तकाते ऽपि गच्छेद्
धि परमां गतिम्॥) 13. 17. 18; this
great, eternal secret was proclaimed by
Brahman himself (यत् तद् रहस्यं पर-
मं ब्रब्मप्रोक्तं सनातनम्) 13. 17. 5.
F. Who may receive the Stavarāja: It may
be taught to one who is devoted (to god), to
one who has faith, and one who believes in
god; but it should not be taught to a non-
believer who is lack of faith in the bodily
form and who has not controlled his self
(इदं भक्ताय दातव्यं श्रद्दधानास्ति-
काय च।नाश्रद्दधानरूपाय नास्तिकाया-
जितामने) 13. 17. 16 (Unknown commenta-
tor: वेदबोधितफलावश्यंभावनिश्चयः
श्रद्धा।वेदाः प्रमाणम् इति ज्ञानवान्
आस्तिकः।उक्तविपरीतो नास्तिकः Cr. Ed. 17(2).
1062. on 13. 17. 6); it should not be taught
to one who scorns god Pinākin (Śiva); such
a person goes to hell with his ancestors and
descendants 13. 17. 17; it should be learnt
with due effort and then be preserved by one
who has controlled his mind (प्रयत्नेनाध्-
इगन्तव्यं धार्यं च प्रयतात्मना) 13.
17. 15.
G. Rewards obtained: By listen-
ing to the name of Śarva listed in the Stava-
rāja one obtains all desires 13. 17. 29; by
reciting this Stava the sage Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana
obtained all his desires while he was practis-
ing austerities on mount Meru for a son; he
therefore advised Yudhiṣṭhira to recite the
स्तव so that he would also obtain all his
desires by the grace of Maheśvara 13. 18. 1-3;
by praising Śiva with the names in this स्तव
one obtains one's Self (प्राप्नोत्य् आत्मानम्
आत्मना) 13. 17. 153; god Mahādeva is
pleased by the recitation of his names and he
establishes his devotees in himself (भक्ता-
नुकम्पी भगवान् आत्मसंस्थान् करोति
तान्) 13. 17. 155; by its recitation a person
who is cleansed of his sins becomes devoted
to Bhava (Śiva) which (devotion) leads
him to attain the highest perfection (जन्तोर्
विशुद्धपापस्य भवे भक्तिः प्रजायते। …
तस्यैव च प्रसादेन भक्तिर् उत्पद्यते
नृणाम्।यया याति परां सिद्धिम्) 13. 17.
158, 160; the demons, the Yakṣas, the
Rākṣasas, the Piśācas, the Yātudhānas, the
Guhyakas and the snakes do not put
obstacle in the way (of one who recites this
स्तव) 13. 17. 170; he who observing rules
of purity and celibacy, with controlled sense-
organs, recites this स्तव for one year with-
out a break in application obtains the fruit
of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice (यः
पठेत शुचिर् भूत्वा ब्रह्मचारी जितेन्द्रि-
यः।अभग्नयोगो वर्षं तु सोऽ श्वमेध-
फलं लभेत्॥) 13. 17. 171; by praising
god Mahādeva with the names (in this
Stava) Jāmadagnya, who was afflicted by
the sin of killing his father and the
Brāhmaṇas (? पितृविप्रवधेनाहम् आर्तः;)
13. 18. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 18. 12: पितृ-
तुल्या विप्राः ‘ज्येष्ठो भ्राता पितुः समः’
इति स्मृतेर् ज्येष्ठा भ्रातरस् तेषां वधेन),
was freed of the sin; in addition the god
gave him an axe and divine missiles and made
him invincible; god of death would not over-
power Jāmadagnya and he would be famous
13. 18. 9-12 (पापं न भविता ते ऽद्य
अजेयश् च भविष्यसि।न ते प्रभविता
मृत्युर् यशस्वी च भविष्यसि॥ 12).

Drupada and Jayadratha fought each other
as would Śukra and Aṅgāraka 6. 43.
54; Arjuna killed many Saṃśaptakas by
adopting repeatedly oblique movements like
Aṅgāraka (वक्रानुवक्रगमनाद् अङ्गारक
इव ग्रहः) 8. 14. 1; Alambusa, in his duel
with Ghaṭotkaca, fell down on the ground
as would Aṅgāraka by chance (यदृच्छया
निपतितम् अलम्बुसम् (7. 84. 26), भूमाव्
अङ्गारकं यथा) 7. 84. 27; Bhūri, a
Kaurava, when struck by the शक्ति of
Sātyaki fell down on the ground from his

sky (लोहिताङ्ग इवाकाशाद् दीप्तरश्मिर् यद्-
ऋच्छया) 7. 141. 12. 2. Omens: Vyāsa
told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Aṇgāraka making re-
trograde (वक्र) movement in the con-
stellation Maghā indicated fierce destruction
of the two armies (सेनयोर् अशिवं घोरं
करिष्यति महाग्रहः।मघास्व् अङ्गारको
वक्रः) 6. 3. 13; another bad omen pointed
out by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the war
was that Mars, the red-bodied one (लोहि-
ताङ्ग), after making repeated retrograde
movements and returning to the Brahmarāśi
was established in the Śravaṇa नक्षत्र
(वक्रानुवक्रं कृत्वा च श्रवणे पावक-
प्रभः।ब्रह्मराशिं समावृत्य लोहिताङ्गो
व्यवस्थितः।) 6. 3. 17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6.
3. 18: तत्रैव सर्वतोभद्रचक्रे मघा-
स्थो लोहिताङ्गो ऽङ्गारको वक्रानुवक्रं
पुनःपुनर् वक्रीभूय ब्रह्मणा बृहस्-
पतिनाक्रान्तम् राशिं नक्षत्रं श्रवणं
समावृत्य सम्यक् पूर्णदृष्ट्या विद्ध्वा
तिष्ठति); among the bad omens noticed by
Karṇa and pointed out to Kṛṣṇa one referred to
the retrograde motion of Mars in Jyeṣṭhā and
his wooing Anurādhā thereby as though tran-
quilizing the Maitra Nakṣatrayoga (कृत्वा
चाङ्गारको वक्रं ज्येष्ठायां मधु-
सूदन।अनुराधां प्रार्थयते मैत्रं
संशमयन्न् इव॥) 5. 141. 8 (Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 9: ज्येष्ठाम् अप्राप्य
यदि भौमो वक्रीभवेत् तर्हि ज्येष्ठस्य

the Nakṣatra Anurādhā, after observing fast,
a gift of a covering (प्रावार) and another
cloth (वस्त्रान्तर), he is glorified in the
heaven for a hundred Yugas 13. 63. 22; if
one offers a श्राद्ध under Anurādhā he
establishes a line of kings (?राजचक्रम्
प्रवर्तयेत्) 13. 89. 8.
B. Bad omens:
Among the bad omens reported by Karṇa to
Kṛṣṇa there was one which referred to the
retrograde motion of Mars (Aṅgāraka) in
Jyeṣṭhā and his wooing Anurādhā thereby as
though tranquilizing the Maitra Nakṣatra-
yoga (कृत्वा चाङ्गारको वक्रं ज्येष्ठायां
मधुसूदन।अनुराधां प्रार्थयते
मैत्रं संशमयन्न् इव) 5. 141. 8 (For
Nī. comm. see Aṅgāraka).

अभिजित्
Abhijit f.: Name of the twentieth
Nakṣatra.
Described as heavenly (देवी) 3. 219.
8; Indra reported to Skanda that Abhijit,
the younger sister vying with Rohiṇī as she
desired higher rank, went to the forest to
practise austerities; Indra was, therefore, con-
fused (in reckoning time) due to the dropping
down of one Nakṣatra from the sky (अभिजित्
स्पर्धमाना तु रोहिण्या कन्यसी स्वसा।
इच्छन्ती ज्येष्ठतां देवी तपस् तप्तुं

गगनाच् च्युतम्।कालं त्व् इमं परं
स्कन्द ब्रह्मणा सह चिन्तय) 3. 219. 8-9;
(to fill the gap, the Kṛttikās went to the heaven
3. 219. 11) (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 230. 8-9, 11:
कन्यसी कनिष्ठा वनं गता अधिकारं

श्रेष्ठाम् अवाप्नुयात्) 13. 89. 11. [See
Abhijita1]

अभिजित
Abhijita1 m.: Name of a Nakṣatra
(= Abhijit ?)

is काम्य) under the constellation Āśleṣā one
got heroic sons 13. 89. 5.

उत्तर
Uttara Proṣṭhapada m.: Name of a
नक्षत्र। [See Uttarā Bhādrapadā]

उत्तरा
Uttarā Phalgunī f. (sg., du, pl.):
Name of a नक्षत्र।
A. Epic event: Arjuna was born on
the mountain Himavant under the junction
of the two constellations Pūrvā and Uttarā
Phalgunī, hence called Phalguna (उत्तरा-
भ्यां च पूर्वाभ्यां फल्गुनीभ्याम्
अहं दिवा।जातो हिमवतः पृष्ठे तेन
मां फल्गुनं विदुः) 4. 39. 14. (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 4. 44. 16: उत्तराभ्यां च
पूर्वाभ्याम् इति पाठे नक्षत्रसन्धौ इत्य्
अर्थः).
B. Religious rites: Nārada told
Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that if, after ob-
serving fast (उपोषितः 13. 63. 13), one gave,
according to the rites (विधिवत्), under this
नक्षत्र (उत्तराविषये) gift of cooked rice
made of grains that ripen in sixty days (षष्टि-
कौदन) mixed with घृत and milk, he
was honoured in heaven 13. 63. 14; whatever
gift one gave under this नक्षत्र it produced
ample benefit that became everlasting (यद्
यत् प्रदीयते दानम् उत्त्राविषये नरैः।
महाफलम् अनतं च भवतीति विनिश्-
चयः) 13. 63. 15; Yama told Śaśabindu (13.
89. 1) that if one offered a काम्य श्राद्ध
under this नक्षत्र one got progeny (अपत्य-
भाग् उत्तरासु) 13. 89. 6.

उत्तरा
Uttarā Bhādrapadā f. (sg., pl), Uttara
Proṣṭhapada m. (sg.): Name of a con-
stellation.
A. Religious rites: Nārada told Devakī
(13. 63. 2-4) that if one gave as a gift
meat of a ram or a sheep under the conste-
llation Uttarā Bhādrapadā he gave delight to
the manes and obtained infinite (happiness)
after death (औरभ्रम् उत्तरायोगे यस् तु
मांसं प्रयच्छति।स पितॄन् प्रीणयति
वै प्रेत्य चानन्त्यम् अश्नुते) 13. 63. 32;
Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that
by offering a काम्य श्राद्ध under this
नक्षत्र one got a thousand cows (उत्तरास्व्
अथ कुर्वाणः) 13. 89. 13.
B. Bad
omens: Among the bad omens which oc-
curred before the start of the war and
which were reported by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
there was one according to which the planet
Śukra after ascending Pūrva Proṣṭhapada and
then having gone to the Uttara Proṣṭhapada
was, together with it (?) looking back at
(the Pūrva Preṣṭhapada) (शुक्रः प्रोष्ठ-
पदे पूर्वे समारुह्य विशां पते।उत्तरे
तु परिक्रम्य सहितः प्रत्युदीक्षते॥)
6. 3. 14 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. on 6.
3. 15: पूर्वे प्रोष्ठपदे पूर्वाभाद्रपदा-
नक्षत्रं समारुह्य परिक्रम्य परि-
घाख्य उपग्रहस् तेन सहितः उत्तरे
उत्तराभाद्रपदानक्षत्रम् उदीक्षते आक्रा-
न्तुम् इच्छति).

उत्तरायण
Uttarāyaṇa nt.: Name of the period in
which the sun moves to the north, the summer
solstice; also called Udagā̆yana (-आ- म्। च्।)
(6. 114. 98; 12. 224. 16).
A. Sun's courses fixed by Brahman:
Śakra told Bali that the self-born god (Sva-
yaṃbhū) had fixed the movements of the
sun following which the sun moved towards
the north for six months and towards the
south for six months 12. 218. 35-36.
B.
Its duration: The calculators of the divi-
sions of time say that the year consists of
two अयनस् (sun's courses), viz. दक्षिण
and उत्तर (संवतसरं द्वे अयने वदन्ति
संख्याविदो दक्षिणम् उत्तरम् च) 12.
224. 13; (12. 47. 42); 13. 16. 46; Nārada
told Devamata that the two अयनस् (दक्षिण
and उत्तर) form a pair and between them
is fire; Brāhmaṇas knew that that is the
highest form of उदान (? उभे चैवायने
द्वंद्वं तयोर् मध्ये हुताशनः।एतद्
रूपम् उदानस्य परमं ब्राह्मना विदुः)
14. 24. 15; Vyāsa had told Śuka that the night
and the day of the gods was equal to one
human year of which the उत्तरायण form-
ed the day and the दक्षिणायन the night
(दैवे रात्र्यहनी वर्षम् प्रविभागस् तयोः
पुनः।अहस् तत्रोदगयनं रात्रिः स्याद्
दक्षिणायनम्) 12. 224. 16.
C. Effects
on the earth: The sun, during its two
courses, northern and southern, distributes
cold and heat among the people (अयनं
तस्य षण्मासा उत्तरं दक्षिणं तथा।
येन संयाति लोकेषु शीतोष्णे विसृजन् रविः॥)
12. 218. 36; the sun, having traversed its
northern course and having collected with his
rays the heated waters, turns for the southern
course and enters the earth; there, lying in
the earth and sprinkled with the energies of
the moon, it produces plants which serve as
food for living beings (गत्वोत्तरायणं
तेजोरसान् उद्धृत्य रश्मिभिः।दक्षिणा-
यनम् आवृत्तो महीं निविशते रविः॥ …
निषिक्तश् चन्द्रतेजोभिः सूयते भूगतो
रविः।ओषध्यः षड्रसा मेध्यास् तद्
अन्नं प्राणिनां भुवि॥) 3. 3. 6, 8 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 6: तेजोरसान् जलानि).
D. Importance: Mahādeva (13. 16. 13)
identified with both the Uttara and the
Dakṣiṇa ayana 13. 16. 46.
E. Considered
holy: The night in the Uttarāyaṇa is con-
sidered holy and divine; Śacī bowed down
to this goddess Rātri so that her wish to see
her husband was fulfilled (पुण्यां चेमाम्
अहं दिव्यां प्रवृत्ताम् उत्तरायणे।देवीं
रात्रिम् नमस्यामि सिध्यतां मे मनोर-
थः॥) 5. 13. 23; from Dakṣiṇāyana (which
symbolizes darkness) proceeds Uttarāyaṇa
(which stands for light); (hence) the gift of
light is praiseworthy (अन्धं तमस् तमि-
स्रं च दक्षिणायनम् एव च।उत्तरायणम्
एतस्माज् ज्योतिर्दानं प्रशस्यते॥) 13. 101.
46 (perhaps what is meant is that giving
gifts of light helps the bringing in of the
Uttarāyaṇa. Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 98. 47:
तमिस्रं अन्धकारः।अन्धंतमो नाम
नरकरूपं तथा दक्षिणायनम् अप्य्
अन्धंतम एव।अत उत्तरायणे रात्रौ
तमोनाशकं ज्योतिर् देयं नरकनिवृत्त्यर्-
थम्। Editor, Cr. Ed., Vol. 17. (part II),
p. 1098 on 13. 101. 46, however,: “Does this
suggest the origin of the Dīpāvali festival ?”).
F. Bhīṣma's death in Uttarāyaṇa: Bhīṣma
when he fell on the ground in the war did not
give up his life as he wished to wait till the
setting in of the Uttarāyaṇa 6. 114. 89; he
assured the sages, sent to him by Gaṅgā, when
they came to him in the form of swans, that
he would sustain his life and go to his ori-
ginal place when the sun had turned towards
the north 6. 114. 97; he told them that he
would sustain his life longing for the Uttarā-
yaṇa; established in complete sway (over his
life), he could control the act of giving up
life; he would therefore hold life for some
time since he wished to die in the Udagāyana
(धारयिष्याम्य् अहं प्राणान् उत्तरायण-
काङ्क्षया।ऐश्वर्यभूतः प्राणानाम्
उत्सर्गे नियतो ह्य् अहम्।तस्मात् प्राणान्
धारयिष्ये मुमूर्षुर् उदगायने॥) 6.
114. 98 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 119. 106:
स्वसामर्थ्येन भूतः प्राप्तः स्वच्छ-
न्दमृत्युत्वात्); Bhīṣma's future death in
the Uttarāyaṇa alluded to by Yudhiṣṭhira 12.
291. 4 (आवृत्ते भगवत्य् अर्के गनतासि पर-
मां गतिम्); Bhīṣma asked Yudhiṣṭhira to
come back to him when the sun had returned
from the Dakṣiṇāyana and the Uttarāyaṇa
had set in 13. 152. 10; when the Uttarāyaṇa
set in, Yudhiṣṭhira started from Hāstinapura
to meet Bhīṣma (for the remembered what
Bhīṣma had told him) 13. 153. 6; Bhīṣma
greeted Yudhiṣṭhira and said that the sun had
turned back (from the Dakṣināyana) 13.
153. 26; as soon as the sun had returned to
its northerly course Bhīṣma, well composed,
placed himself in his soul (to he ready to
abandon the body) 12. 47. 3; Bhīṣma gave
up his life when the Uttarāyaṇa had set in
14. 59. 12.

उत्तराषाढा
Uttarāṣāḍhā f. (pl.): Name of a con-
stellation.
Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that if
one gave under the Uttarā Aṣāḍhā a pot of
barley-preparation (?) mixed with clarified
butter and thickened with plenty of honey
one obtained all desires 13. 63. 26. (उदमन्-
थं ससर्पिष्कं प्रभूतमधुफाणि-
तम्।दत्त्वोत्तरास्व् अषाढासु सर्वकामान्
अवाप्नुयात्॥ Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 64. 26:
(उदमन्थम्) उदकुंभयुक्तं सक्तु-
विकारम्; Unknown commentator: उदमन्-
थं नवनीतम्, cf. Cr. Ed., Vol. 17, part II.
p. 1080 note on 13. 63. 26); Yama told Śaśa-
bindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering a काम्य
श्राद्ध under the Uttarā Aṣāḍhā one was
freed of all sorrow (उत्तरासु त्व् अषाढासु
वीतशोकश् चरेन् महीम्) 13. 89. 10.

उद्गायन
Udgā̆yana nt.: See Uttarāyaṇa.

ऐन्द्र
Aindra adj.: See Jyeṣṭhā.

कलि
Kali m., Kaliyuga nt.: Name of one
of the four Yugas or ages; also called Puṣya
(6. 11. 3-4, 7, 12, 13) and Tiṣya (is कलि-
पुरस्कृत 12. 327. 76; 12. 337. 42; Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 3. (= Cr. Ed. 6. 11. 3
reads तिष्यम् (in place of Cr. Ed. पुष्यम्)
and explains it as कलियुगम्).
A. Characterization: Characterized as
कृष्णयुग (12. 337. 44) and तामसयुग
(3. 148. 33).
B. Place among the four
Yugas: Fourth and the last Yuga, hence
referred to as the चतुर्थ युग (युगस्य
च चतुर्थस्य राजा भवति कारणम्)
5. 130. 16; 12. 70. 25, or as पश्चिम
युगकाल 3. 189. 13; it comes at the close
of the Dvāpara Yuga (संक्षेपाद् द्वाप-
रस्याथ ततः पुष्यं प्रवर्तते) 6. 11.
4; hence referred to after the Dvāpara as
अपर युग 12. 259. 32; Hanūmant told
Bhīma that the Kaliyuga will commence
soon (after the Dvāpara) (एअतत् कलियुगं
नाम अचिराद् यत् प्रवर्तते) 3. 148. 37;
after the Kaliyuga commences again the
Kṛtayuga (क्षीणे कलियुगे चैव प्रवर्तति
कृतं युगम्) 3. 186. 22.
C. Duration:
Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the Kali
Yuga lasts for 1000 years; it is preceded by
dawns of 100 years and followed by evenings
of equal duration (सहस्रम् एकं वर्षाणां
ततः कलियुगं स्मृतम्।तस्य वर्षशतं
संध्या संध्यांशश् च ततः परम्।
संध्यासंध्यांशयोस् तुल्यं प्रमाणम्
उपधारय) 3. 186. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
3. 188. 23: सन्ध्या पूर्वस्मिन् युगे उत्तर-
युगधर्माणाम् उपसर्जनतया संक्र-
मः।सन्ध्यांशस् तूत्तरस्मिन् पूर्वयुग-
धर्माणाम्); the same duration for Kaliyuga
was narrated by Vyāsa to Śuka 12. 224. 20.
D. Events marking the advent of the Kali
Yuga: (1) The armies of the Kurus and the
Pāṇḍavas fought each other near the Samanta-
pañcaka at the junction of the Dvāpara
and the Kali Yuga (अन्तरे चैव सं-
प्राप्ते कलिद्वापरयोर् अभूत्।समन्त-
पञ्चके युद्धं कुरुपाण्डवसेनयोः)
1. 2. 9; (2) Nārāyaṇa told Apāntaratamas
that when the Tiṣyayuga will have set in the
kings born in the line of Bharata, known as
the Kurus, will be born of him (i. e. of Apān-
taratamas then born as Vyāsa) and that
there will be a feud in the family leading to
mutual destruction (here Tiṣya, i. e. Kali,
is mentioned in place of Dvāpara due to
close proximity ?) (पुनस् तिष्ये च संप्रा-
प्ते कुरवो नाम भारताः।भविष्यन्ति
महात्मानो राजानः प्रथिता भुवि॥तेषां
त्वत्तः प्रसूतानां कुलभेदो भविष्यति।
परस्परविनाशार्थं) 12. 337. 42-43;
(3) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that at the end
of the junction of the Dvāpara and the
Kali age he would appear in Mathurā for
the killing of Kaṃsa (द्वापरस्य कलेश्
चैव संधौ पर्यवसानिके।प्रादुर्भा-
वः कंसहेतोः मथुरायां भविष्यति)
12. 326. 82; (4) at the end of the Dvā-
para and the beginning of the Kali age
Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa), along with Saṃkarṣaṇa,
is sung according to the Sātvata mode of
worship (द्वापरस्य युगस्यान्ते आदौ
कलियुगस्य च।सात्वतं विधिस्म् आस्थाय
गीतः संकर्षणेन यः) 6. 62. 39.
E.
Kaliyuga and Nārāyaṇa and Vyāsa: (1)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in the Kali
Yuga Kṛṣṇa came down to the earth as
अधर्म (कृष्णः।कलाव् अधर्मः क्षितिम्
आजगाम 13. 143. 9; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13.
158. 10: कलौ त्व् अधर्म एव बलवान् इति
भावः); the god (Nārāyaṇa i. e. Kṛṣṇa-
Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya
that he has dark colour in the Kaliyuga
(कृष्णः कलियुगे तथा) 3. 187. 31;
तामसं युगम् आसाद्य कृष्णो भवति
केशवः) 3. 148. 33; (2) Hari-Nārāyaṇa
told Apāntaratamas (12. 337. 38) that when
Kṛṣṇayuga (i. e. Kaliyuga) sets in he (as
Vyāsa) will have dark colour (कृष्णे युगे
च संप्राप्ते कृष्णवर्णो भविष्यसि) 12.
337. 44.
F. King and the Kali Yuga:
All the Yugas are dependent on the king's
behaviour, hence a king is called a युग
(राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव युगम् उच्यते)
12. 92. 6; according to Bhīṣma all the
Yugas, including Kali, are rooted in a king
(राजमूलानि सर्वाणि) 12. 139. 10; it is the
king who makes the Yugas what they are and
hence he is also the cause of the fourth Yuga
(i. e. the Kaliyuga) (युगस्य च चतुर्थ-
स्य राजा भवति कारणम्) 5. 130. 16; 12.
70. 25; by bringing about the Kali age the
king incurs immense sin (कलेः प्रवर्तनाद्
राजा पापम् अत्यन्तम् अश्नुते) 12. 70. 27;
by bringing about the Kaliyuga (not directly
stated) the evil-doer (i. e. the king) lives
eternally in the hell (ततो वसति दुष्कर्मा
नरके शाश्वतीः समाः) 5. 130. 18; when
the king wholly gives up दण्डनीति and
oppresses his subjects unjustly the Kali age
makes its appearance (दण्डनीतिं परित्य-
ज्य यदा कार्त्स्न्येन भूमिपः।प्रजाः
क्लिश्नात्य् अयोगेन प्रविश्यति तदा कलिः)
12. 70. 18; where the sinful ones move about
freely among the righteous, there the Kali
age (? or the evil spirit ?) meets the kings
(? यत्र पापा ज्ञायमानाश् चरन्ति सतां
कलिर् विन्दति तत्र राज्ञाः) 12. 92. 27
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 91. 28: राज्ञः
नृपान्).
G. Kali Yuga and धर्म:
While describing the four Yugas Hanūmant
told Bhīma that in the Kali Yuga धर्म
stands only on one foot (पादेनैकेन
कौन्तेय धर्मः कलियुगे स्थितः) 3.
148. 32; (पादेन त्व् अपरे (i. e. कलौ)
युगे) 12. 259. 32; (ततस् तिष्ये ऽथ सं-
प्राप्ते युगे कलिपुरस्कृते।एकपाद-
स्थितो धर्मो यत्र तत्र भविष्यति) 12.
327. 76 (however, commentator Vādirāja:
तिष्ये पुष्यनक्षत्रे, note on this stanza in
the Cr. Ed.); 12. 224. 23; gods asked
Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa what they should do
when the धर्म in the Tiṣya Yuga stood
on one foot 12. 327. 77; in the Kali Yuga
(not directly mentioned) अधर्म rules
over men in three parts while धर्म attends
men only in one part (त्रिभिर् अंशैर्
अधर्मस् तु लोकान् आक्रम्य तिष्ठति।चतुर्-
थांशेन धर्मस् तु मनुष्यान् उपति-
ष्ठति) 3. 188. 12; in the Kali Yuga धर्म
is reduced to its sixteenth कोला on account
of the misbehaviour of kings (तथा कलियुगे
प्राप्ते राज्ञां दुश्चरितेन ह।भवेत्
कालविशेष्ण कला धर्मस्य षोडशी) 12.
259. 33.
H. Nature of the Kali Yuga
and its effects on men: Vedic practices dwin-
dle, so also the religious and the sacrificial
rites; on the other hand, seasonal calamities,
diseases, lassitude, vices like anger and
others, calamities and mental agonies are ex-
perienced (वेदाचाराः प्रशाम्यन्ति धर्म-
यज्ञक्रियास् तथा॥ईतयो व्याधयस्
तन्द्री दोषाः क्रोधादयस् तथा।उपद्रवाश्
च वर्तन्ते आधयो व्याधयस् तथा॥ 3.
148. 33-34; also cf. 3. 186. 24-55; 3. 188.
5-6, 13-84; 12. 224. 62; in the Kali Yuga
the Vedas are seen (i. e. practised) by some
and not by others; they, which alone serve as
dams of धर्म, fall into ruin along with
the sacrifices (दृश्यन्ते नापि दृश्यन्ते वेदाः
कलियुगे ऽखिलाः।उत्सीदन्ते सयज्ञाश् च
केवला धर्मसेतवः॥) 12. 224. 66; 12.
230. 15-17; the study of the Vedas dwindles
gradually in each succeeding Yuga (वेद-
वादाश् चानुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति च नः श्रुतम्)
12. 224. 25; the अधर्म in the Yugas
other than the Kṛta is on increase due to the
practice of theft, falsehood and deceipt 12.
224. 23; the duties (धर्माः) to be followed
in the Kali Yuga are different (from those of
the other Yugas); they have been prescribed
as if keeping in mind the (lowered) capacity
of men in that age (अन्ये कलियुगे धर्मा
यथाशक्तिकृता इव) 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;
giving gifts is specially recommended for the
Kali Yuga (दानम् एव कलौ युगे) 12.
224. 27; in the Kali age अधर्म is practised
by many, and धर्म only by a few; all
the Varṇas are disinclined to follow धर्म
proper to them 12. 70. 19; also 20-24; the
nature of men in the Puṣyayuga is describ-
ed also in 6. 11. 12-13; strict adherence
to धर्म is not to be expected in the Kali
Yuga-this is what Kṛṣṇa implied in his
words addressed to Balarāma to assuage his
wrath (प्राप्तं कलियुगं विद्धि) 9. 59.
21; in the Kali age (as in the Dvāpara) it
is necessary for people to he paired to beget
children (द्वापरे मैथुनो धर्मः प्रजा-
नाम् अभवन् नृप।तथा कलियुगे राजन्
द्वन्द्वम् आपेदिरे जनाः॥) 12. 200. 37;
the ascetics born in the Kali age (as also in
the Tretā and the Dvāpara) are beset with
doubts (त्रेतायां द्वापरे चैव कलिजाश् च
ससंशयाः।तपस्विनः) 12. 230. 7; evil
tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas and
others which originate in the south (दक्षिणा-
पथजन्मानः) and those like the Yaunas,
the Kāmbojas, and other which have their
origin in the north (उत्तरापथजन्मानः)
roam on the earth in the Tretā and the follow-
ing Yugas (i. e. also in the Kali) (त्रेता-
प्रभृति वर्तन्ते ते जना भरतर्षभ)
12. 200. 39-42; Dyumatsena told Satyavān
that if the Dasyus were not killed then
in the Kaliyuga people would say to each
other: “this is mine, not his”, it would
then be difficult to carry on every day life
(ममेदम् इति नास्यैतत् प्रवर्तेत कलौ
युगे।लोकयात्रा न चैव स्यात्) 12. 259. 6; if
one always recites the description of the origin
of cows he is freed of the impurity of the Kali
age (? or of evil spirit ?) (इमं गवां प्र-
भवविधानम् उत्तमं पठन् सदा …
विमुच्यते कलिकलुषेण मानवः) 13. 76. 32.
I. Span of life: In the Puṣya (i. e. the Kali)
Yuga there is no fixed span of life; people die
(even) in the womb or immediately after
they are born (न प्रमाणस्थितिर् ह्य् अस्ति
पुष्ये ऽस्मिन् भरतर्षभ गर्भस्थाश् च
म्रियन्ते ऽत्र तथा जाता म्रियन्ति च॥)
6. 11. 7; the life-span, as also other faculties,
of human beings decrease successively in
each following Yuga (आयुर् वीर्यम् … ।
मनुस्याणाम् अनुयुगं ह्रसतीति निबोध
मे॥) 3. 188. 13; however, life is expected
to be of a hundred years ( … त्रेतादिष्व् एते-
सां पादशो ह्रसते वयः) 12. 224. 24, 25.
J. Kali as a name of Sūrya: Kali occurs
among the 108 names of Sūrya taught by
Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 20: कलिः सर्वमलाश्रय
इत्य् एकं नाम).

काम्याष्टमी
Kāmyāṣṭamī f.: Name of the eighth
day (of the bright or the dark fortnight ?) of
the month (?)
One should give cows and then observe
the गोव्रत (live like a cow ?) for three
nights, spending one of the nights with cows;
then from the Kāmyāṣṭamī he should live
three nights on milk or on cow-dung and cow-
urine (गा वै दत्त्वा गोव्रती स्यात् त्रिरात्रं
निशां चैकां संवसेतेह ताभिः।काम्या-
ष्टम्यां वर्तितव्यं त्रिरात्रं रसैर् वा
गोः शकृता प्रस्नवैर् वा॥) 13. 75. 19.

कार्तयुग
Kārtayuga: See Kṛtayuga.

कार्तिक|कार्त्तिक
Kārttika m.: Name of a month.
A. Epic event related with this month:
The wrestling match between Bhīma and
Jarāsandha began on the first day of Kārttika
2. 21. 17.
B. Religious rite performed in
this month: Aṅgiras told Bhīṣma that if one
took food only once a day in Kārttika he
became brave, got many wives, and became
famous (कार्त्तिकं तु नरो मासं यः
कुर्याद् एकभोजनम्।शूरश् च बहु-
भार्यश् च कीर्तिमांश् चैव जायते॥) 13.
109. 29. [See Kaumuda]

कार्त्तिकी
Kārttikī (Cr. Ed. also Kārtikī) f.:
The night of full moon in the month of
Kārttika.
A. Description: Most holy among the
पर्वन्स् (पुण्यतमा रात्रिः पर्वसन्धौ)
3. 179. 16; the best conjunction (योगम्
उत्तमम्) 3. 179. 17.
B. Epic events
connected with this तिथि: (1) When the
Pāṇḍavas lived near the river Sarasvatī there
occurred the Kārttikī of the autumn season;
the Pāṇḍavas spent that night of best con-
junction in the company of the holy ascetics
and when the darkness set in (तमिस्राभ्य्-
उदये) they, with Dhaumya, went to the
Kāmyaka forest 3. 179. 16-18; (2) Vidura
reported to Yudhiṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra
had decided to retire to the forest on the
following Kārtikī (गमिष्यति वनं राजन्
कार्तिकीम् आगताम् इमाम्) 15. 17. 3; before
setting for the forest Dhṛtarāṣṭra wished to
give rich gifts on the Kārtikī (कार्तिक्याम्) 15.
19. 15; he gave those gifts for ten days preced-
ing (the Kārttikī) (दशाहम् एवं दानानि
दत्त्वा राजाम्बिकासुतः) 15. 20. 17; gifts
given by him detailed in 15. 20. 3-16; the
gifts were intended as a श्राद्ध or an
और्ध्वदेहिक for Bhīṣma and the rest 15.
17. 4-5, 9, 17; 15. 19. 11; Dhṛtarāṣṭra there-
by wanted to pay back the debt he owed to
his sons and friends (बभूव पुत्रपौत्रा-
णाम् अनृणो भरतर्षभ) 15. 20. 17; 15.
18. 11; he started for the forest when the
Brāhmaṇas, at his instance, offered an इष्टि
on the Kārttikī 15. 21. 2.
C. Bad omens:
Among the bad omens reported by Vyāsa to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the start of the great war
one was related to the night of the Kārttikī
full moon when the moon having the colour
of fire, shining in the sky of the same colour,
became lustreless and could not be noticed
(अलक्ष्यः प्रभया हीनः पौर्णमासीं
च कार्त्तिकीम्।चन्द्रो ऽभूद् अग्निवर्णश्
च समवर्णे नभस्तले॥) 6. 2. 23.
D. Religious importance: (1) Merit of a
person who visits Puṣkara on the Kārtikī
grows undecayingly 3. 80. 52; spending one
full moon Kārtikī night at Puṣkara was
equal to offering अग्निहोत्र for full hundred
years 3. 80. 57; (2) Pilgrims bathe in the
river Sarasvatī for a year following the
occurrence of the Kārtikī (सरस्वत्यां
महाराज अनु संवत्सरं हि ते।स्नायन्ते
भरतश्रेष्ठ वृत्तां वै कार्तिकीं सदा)
3. 80. 121; with this bath one shone like a
moon and obtained fruit of giving a thousand
cows 3. 80. 122; (3) Virūpākṣa, the king
of the Rākṣasas used to feed a thousand
excellent Brāhmaṇas on the autumnal full
moon day of the Kārttika; according to the
श्रुति texts Brāhmaṇas should be given preci-
ous stones (रत्नानि) on that day; Virūpākṣa
assured the Brāhmaṇas that they need have
no fear from the Rākṣasas on that one day
of Kārttikī and they need not be in a hurry
to go away 12. 165. 9, 16, 23; details of
how Virūpākṣa honoured Brāhmaṇas 12
165. 10-14, 17-19.

कुहू
Kuhū f.: Name of the second Amā-
vāsyā day (if the Amāvāsyā extends over
two days (see Ait. Br. 32. 9, Nirukta 11. 31)
and on which the moon is not seen.
Described as venerable (भगवती) and
one whose only digit is very small (एकानंशा)
3. 208. 8 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 218. 8: एका
कला अनंशा अल्पांशवती); personified, she
was the eighth daughter of Aṅgiras, and
was called Kuhū because people, having seen
her, were struck with wonder (यां तु दृष्ट्वा
भगवतीं जनः कुहुकुहायते) 3. 208. 8
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 218. 8: कुहुकुहायते
विस्मितो भवति); Kuhū formed one of the
four reins (योक्त्र) for the horses yoked
to the chariot of Mahādeva when it was
made ready for his fight with the Tripuras
8. 24. 74; she attended the investiture of
Kumāra (Skanda) as the general of the gods
which took place near the river Sarasvatī 9.
44. 12, 16; Brāhmaṇas call Devasenā, chief
queen of Skanda, by different names, one
of them being Kuhū (स्कन्दस्य महिषीम्
 … षष्ठीं यां ब्राह्मणाः प्राहुः … सिनी-
वालीं कुहूं चैव) 3. 218. 47.

कृत
Kṛta, Kṛtayuga nt.: Name of the first
among the four Yugas; also called Devayuga
(1. 14. 5; 2. 11. 1; 3. 92. 6; 10. 18. 1; 12.
3. 19; 13. 82. 24, Ādiyuga (6. 76. 18; 13.
135. 11), Prājāpatyayuga (12. 113. 4), and
Dharmayuga (12. 308. 7).
A. Description: Auspicious (शुभ)
1. 14. 5; 12. 336. 31; completely free from
the three गुणस् (सत्त्व, रजस् and तमस्),
(त्रैगुण्यपरिवर्जित) 13. 148. 22; the best
period (श्रेष्ठः कालः) 5. 130. 14; 12.
324. 5; 12. 327. 73; the best among the
Yugas (युगोत्तम) 13. 148. 11.
B. Place
among the Yugas: When Brahmā created
the worlds, the first Yuga to occur was the
Kṛta (ततः प्रावर्तत तदा आदौ कृत-
युगं शुभम्) 12. 336. 31; 6. 11. 4; 14.
44. 8; first Yuga after the dissolution of the
entire world (आदितः मनुजव्याघ्र कृत्-
स्नस्य जगतः क्षये … ततो कृतं युगं)
3. 186. 17-18; hence called आदियुग and
प्रथमकल्पित 12. 322. 51; hence also the
words आदौ and पुरा (or पूर्वम्) often
used with Kṛta (12. 59. 13; 12. 336. 31,
and many other citations in section D
below); Kṛta sets in again at the end of
the fourth Kali Yuga; Yudhiṣṭhira asked
Mārkaṇḍeya what would be the (final)
stage of Kali when its end will have arrived
and after which Kṛta will commence again
(युगक्षये॥कां च काष्ठां समा-
साद्य पुनः संपत्स्यते कृतम्) 3. 188.
6-7; 3. 186. 22.
C. Duration: Mārka-
ṇḍedya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of
the Kṛta Yuga was 4000 years; it had dawns
of 400 years and twilights of the same
duration (चत्वार्य् आहुः सहस्राणि वर्षाणां
तत् कृतं युगम्।तस्य तावच्छती संध्या
संध्यांशश् च ततः परम्॥) 3. 186.
18 (cf. Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 188. 23 above
Kali, section C, p. 234); the same duration
of Kṛta told by Vyāsa to Śuka 12. 224.
18-19.
D. Events occurring in the Kṛta
Yuga: (1) All beings are produced from
Viṣṇu at the advent of the Kṛta Yuga and
are reabsorbed into him at the end of that
Yuga 13. 135. 11; (2) The creation of the
world, the creation of Saṃkarṣaṇa, Prad-
yumna, Aniruddha and Brahman, Nārāyaṇa's
incarnation as Varāha to reestablish the earth
and kill Hiraṇyākṣa, as Nṛsiṃha to kill
Hiraṇyakaśipu, and as Vāmana to make
Bali a resident of Pātāla—all these events
are said to have occurred in the Kṛta Yuga
which is not named 12. 326. 67-76; (also
cf. 12. 337. 29-36 where these three incarna-
tions are mentioned without naming Kṛta-
yuga); (3) Formerly, in the Kṛta Yuga
of the Svāyaṃbhuva Manvantara, Nārā-
yaṇa was born as Nara, Nārāyaṇa, Hari
and Kṛṣṇa (नारायणो हि विश्वात्मा चतुर्-
मूरतिः सनातनः।धर्मात्मजः संब-
भूव … ॥कृते युगे महाराज पुरा स्वा-
यंभुवे ऽन्तरे।नरो नारायणश् चैव
हरिः कृष्णस् तथैव च॥) 12. 321. 8-9;
(4) In the Devayuga when the Daityendras
ruled the three worlds Viṣṇu entered the
womb of Aditi (पुरा देवयुगे तात … ) 13.
82. 24-25; (5) In the Devayuga Prajā-
pati had two daughters (पुरा देवयुगे … )
1. 14. 5 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 16. 5: देव-
युगे सत्ययुगे); (6) In the Kṛta Yuga
all gods approached Varuṇa and requested
him to be the ruler of waters 9. 46. 5-6;
(7) In the Devayuga, Āditya came down
from the heaven to visit the world of mortals
when he met Nārada (पुरा देवयुगे
राजन् … ) 2. 11. 1; (8) In one of the past
Devayugas, the gods, desirous of giving
offerings, arranged the sacrifice following the
prescriptions of the Vedas (ततो देवयुगे
ऽतीते देवा वै समकल्पयन्।यज्ञम् वेद-
प्रमाणेन विधिवद् यष्टुम् ईप्सवः) 10.
18. 1; (9) Lomaśa told Yudhiṣṭhira that
formerly in the Devayuga he had seen that
the gods liked the धर्म and the Asuras
deserted it (पुरा देवयुगे चैव दृष्टं
सर्वं मया विभो।अरोचयन् सुरा धर्-
मं धर्मं तत्यजिरे ऽसुराः) 3. 92. 6;
(10) Gods and demons churned the ocean
in the Ādiyuga 6. 76. 18; (11) There were
fierce Dānavas, known as Kāleyas, in the
Kṛta Yuga 3. 98. 3; (12) Asura Gṛtsa
carried away the wife of Bhṛgu in the Deva-
yuga (पुरा देवयुगे तात … ) 12. 3. 19;
(13) In the Kṛta Yuga Manu held the
दण्ड (आसीत् कृतयुगे पूर्वं मनुर्
दण्डधरः प्रभुः) 14. 4. 2; (14)
God Nārāyaṇa told the seven sages (12. 322.
27, 31) that the अनुशासन promulgated by
him and the शास्त्र, together with the अङ्गस्
and the Upaniṣad, will be established by
them in Bṛhaspati Āṅgirasa in the Kṛta Yuga
(not directly named) (उत्पन्ने ऽङ्गिरसे चैव
युगे प्रथमकल्पिते।साङ्गोपनिषदं
शास्त्रं स्थापयित्वा बृहस्पतौ) 12. 322.
51; (15) In the Kṛta there was a famous
sage Taṇḍi who, as a devotee, propitiated
god for ten thousand years by practising
समाधि 13. 16. 12; (16) Formerly in the
the Kṛta Yuga an excellent Brāhmaṇa called
Ārṣṭiṣeṇa lived in a गुरुकुल; he studied
diligently, but could not complete the study
of either the विद्यास् or the Vedas (पुरा
कृतयुगे … ) 9. 39. 3-4; (17) Formerly in
the Kṛta Yuga there lived a king Avikam-
paka who was overpowered in battle by
enemies (पुरा कृतयुगे तात … ) 12. 248. 7;
(18) In the Kṛta Yuga there was a famous
sage Sāvarṇi who practised austerities for
six thousand years to satisfy Rudra 13.
14. 70; (19) Formerly in the Kṛta
Yuga there was a sage Vyāghrapāda who
was versed in the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas
(पुरा कृतयुगे तात … ) 13. 14. 75;
(20) In the Dharmayuga, when Janaka
ruled Mithilā, a certain भिक्षुकी called
Sulabhā roamed alone on the earth 12. 308.
7; (21) In the Prājāpatyayuga (i. e. the
Kṛtayuga) there once lived a large camel
who remembered his previous lives (जातिस्-
मरः); he observed scrupulously the vows
and practised severe austerities in a forest
12. 113. 4; (22) Formerly in the Kṛta
Yuga a Rākṣasa called Cārvāka practised
austerities in the Badarī Āśrama and was
blessed with a boon by Brahman (पुरा
कृतयुगे … ) 12. 39. 39; (23) Nārāyaṇa
told Nārada that formerly in the Kṛta Yuga
when the Veda and the श्रुति were lost, he
retrieved them and (the worlds) were again
supplied with the Vedas and the श्रुतिस् (?)
(यदा वेदश्रुतिर् नष्टा मया प्रत्याहृता
पुरा।सवेदाः सश्रुतीकाश् च कृताः पूर्वं
कृते युगे॥) 12. 326. 94; (24) Formerly,
during the second birth of Brahmā from the
eyes of Nārāyaṇa in the Kṛta Yuga, Rudra,
who received the धर्म of the Ekāntins
from Soma and who practised योग, taught
it to the Vālakhilyas ( … पुरा कृतयुगे
नृप) 12. 336. 15-16; the practice of the
धर्म of the Ekāntins formed such an
important characteristic of the Kṛta Yuga
that if in any other Yuga the world became
full of the Ekāntins that would mean the
advent of the Kṛta Yuga—this is what
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya (यद्य् एकान्-
तिभिर् आकीर्णं जगत् स्यात् कुरुनन्दन।
 … भवेत् कृतयुगप्राप्तिः) 12. 336. 58;
(25) Hari-Nārāyaṇa told Brahmā, born
for the fourth time from his ears (12. 336.
23), to learn the Sātvata Dharma, from
him and establish it in the Kṛta Yuga
12. 336. 27; this धर्म was hence called
Kārtayugadharman 12. 336. 29; Brahmā, as
instructed by Nārāyaṇa, initiated first the
Kṛta Yuga and then the Sātvata धर्म
spread among the people 12. 336. 31; (26)
In the fifth birth of Brahman from the nose
of Nārāyaṇa (12. 336. 36), at the beginning
of the Kṛtayuga, Prajāpati Vīraṇa learnt the
Sātvata Dharma from Sanatkumāra 12. 336.
37; (27) In the seventh birth of Brahman
from a lotus (12. 336. 44), Nārāyaṇa him-
self instructed Pitāmaba in the Sātvata
धर्म at the beginning of the Kṛta Yuga
(not named) तत्रैष धर्मः कथितः
स्वयं नारायणेन हि॥पितामहाय शुद्-
धाय युगादौ लोकधारिणे) 12. 336.
44-45; (28) At the request of Yudhiṣṭhira
Bhīṣma told him how at the beginning,
in the Kṛta Yuga, a kingdom first came
into existence (यथा राज्यं समुत्पन्-
नम् आदौ कृतयुगे ऽभवत्) 12. 59. 13;
(29) Formerly in the Kṛta Yuga the ascetics
residing in the Naimiṣa forest were engaged
in a twelve-yearly sacrificial session (पूर्वं
कृतयुगे राजन् … ) 9. 36. 39.
F. Nārāyaṇa
(Kṛṣṇa) and the Kṛta Yuga: Bhagavān
Nārāyaṇa (who was the same as Kṛṣṇa-
Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya
that his colour in the Kṛta Yuga was white
(श्वेतः कृतयुगे वर्णः) 3. 187. 31; Bhīṣma
told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was complete
Dharma in the Kṛta Yuga (कृते युगे धर्म
आसीत् समग्रः) 13. 143. 9.
G. King and
the Kṛta Yuga: The king is the creator of
the Kṛta Yuga (राजा कृतयुगस्रष्टा) 5.
130. 16 = 12. 70. 25, (also cf. राजा कालस्य
कारणम् 12. 70. 6); Kṛta and the remaining
three Yugas depend on the conduct of the
king and hence the king is identical with
Yuga (राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव युगम्
उच्यते) 12. 92. 6; (राजमूलानि सर्वाणि)
12. 139. 10; when the king fully followed
दण्डनीति then prevailed the Kṛta Yuga, the
best of time (दण्डनीत्यां यदा राजा सम्यक्
कार्त्स्न्येन वर्तते।तदा कृतयुगं नाम
कालः श्रेष्ठः प्रवर्तते॥) 5. 130. 14 =
12. 70. 7; Dyumatsena told Satyavān that in
the Kṛta Yuga the king followed the instruc-
tion (how a king should rule 12. 259. 24-30)
as his primary principle (एतत् प्रथम-
कल्पेन राजा कृतयुगे ऽभजत्) 12. 259. 32;
a king, as the creator of Kṛta, enjoyed in
the heaven endlessly (कृतस्य करणाद् राजा
स्वर्गम् अत्यन्तम् अश्नुते) 5. 130. 17 =
12. 70. 26; king Yayāti was described by
Aṣṭaka as the best among those born in the
Kṛta Yuga (कार्तयुगप्रधान) 1. 85. 1
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 90. 1: कार्तयुगप्र-
धान।कृतयुगे भवाः कार्तयुगाः।अत्य-
न्तनिष्पापा तेषां मुख्यतमेत्य् अर्थः).
H. Kṛta and धर्म: In the Kṛta Yuga
the ancient धर्म prevails (यत्र धर्मः
सनातनः) 3. 148. 10; in that Yuga the eternal
धर्म of the four वर्णस् stands on all its
four feet (i. e. is in no way deficient) (कृते
युगे चतुष्पादश् चातुर्वर्ण्यस्य शाश्वतः)
3. 148. 21; formerly in the Kṛta Yuga Dharma,
the bull, without deceit and free from vices
stood established in its entirety among men
(कृते चतुष्पात् सकलो निर्व्याजोपाधिवर्-
जितः।वृषः प्रतिष्ठितो धर्मो मनुष्येष्व्
अभवत् पुरा॥) 3. 188. 10 (Nī. on 3.
190. 9: वृष इव चतुष्पात्); 12. 327. 73;
both धर्म, on its four feet, and truth
are fully established in the Kṛta Yuga
(चतुष्पात् सकलो धर्मः सत्यं चैव
कृते युगे) 12. 224. 22; since धर्म is not
contaminated by अधर्म (नाधर्मेणा-
गमः कश्चित् 12. 224. 22) it does not get
diminished (धर्मो न ह्रसते क्वचित्) 1.
58. 22; धर्म always prospers and अधर्म
is destroyed 3. 189. 7; 12. 70. 8; धर्म
in the Kṛta Yuga was established among
the Brāhmaṇas who had mastered their self,
who had practised austerities and who had
studied the Vedas (आत्मवत्सु तपोवत्सु
श्रुतवैसु प्रतिष्ठितः) 12. 224. 67; धर्म
in different Yugas is different 12. 224. 26 =
12. 252. 8; austerity is the best धर्म
for the Kṛta (तपः परं कृतयुगे) 12.
24. 27; in the Kṛta Yuga the only धर्म
is renunciation (धर्मः संन्यास एव
च) 3. 148. 13; one is not supposed to
get angry in the Kṛta Yuga (न रोषं
कर्तुम् अर्हसि।नैष धर्मः कृतयुगे
यस् त्वं रोषम् अचीकृथाः) 12. 323. 17.
I. Kṛta and the sacrifice: In the Kṛta
Yuga performance of sacrifices is not pre-
scribed (त्रेतायुगे विधिस् त्व् एषां यज्ञा-
नां न कृते युगे) 12. 224. 62; the sages
who assembled for a sacrifice told gods who
wanted a goat to be killed that that was
not the धर्म of good people; they reminded
the gods that they were in the Kṛta Yuga
when an animal was not offered (नैष
धर्मः सतां देवा यत्र वध्येत वै
पशुः।इदं कृतयुगं श्रेष्ठं कथं
वध्येत वै पशुः॥) 12. 324. 5; (अहिंस्या
यज्ञपशवो युगे ऽस्मिन् नैतद् अन्यथा) 12.
327. 73; the offerings offered by Brahman and
others to Viṣṇu in a Vaiṣṇava Kratu were
offered according to the prescriptions meant
for the Kṛta Yuga and, as a result, they reach-
ed the Puruṣa who had the brightness of the
sun and who was above darkness (ते कार्त-
युगधर्माणो भागा परमसत्कृताः।
प्रापुर् आदित्यवर्णं तं पुरुषं तमसः
परम्॥) 12. 327. 50 (commentator Vidyā-
sāgara: कार्तयुगधर्माणः अहिंसादि-
लक्षणकृतस्वभावाः मन्त्रलोपतन्त्रलोप-
क्रियालोपहिंसादिरहिताः परमसंस्कृताः,
cf. the note on this stanza in the Cr. Ed.);
but according to Bhīṣma when the king, in
any other Yuga, employed दण्डनीती properly,
condition was as good as in the Kṛta Yuga
(12. 70. 7); in such a Kṛta Yuga, all the
three Varṇas offered Soma sacrifices according
to rites (सोमे प्रयत्नं कुर्वन्ति त्रयो
वर्णा यथाविधि) (Editor's note on the
stanza: सोमे = देवतादीन् उद्दिश्य सोमयागे)
and the Vedic rites were faultlessly performed
(वैदिकानि च कर्माणि भवन्त्य् अविगुणान्य्
उत) 12. 70. 9.
J. Nature of the Kṛta
Yuga, its effects on men: Hanūmant told
Bhīma that the times in the Kṛta Yuga were
different from those in the other Yugas
(अन्यः कृतयुगे कालस् त्रेतायां द्वापरे
परः) 3. 148. 6; Kṛta Yuga described by
different persons: (1) by Hanūmant to
Bhīma 3. 148. 11-22 (Kṛta Yuga was com-
pletely free from the three qualities (viz.
सत्त्व, रजस् and तमस्) (त्रैगुण्यपरि-
वर्जितम् 3. 148. 22); (2) by Vaiśaṃpāyana
to Janamejaya 1. 58. 8-24 (काले गावः
प्रसूयन्ते नार्यश् च भरतर्षभ।
फलन्त्य् ऋतुषु वृक्षाश् च पुष्पाणि च
फलानि च॥ 1. 58. 23); (3) by Mārka-
ṇḍeya to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 189. 8-13 (षट्-
कर्मनिरता विप्राः क्षत्रिया रक्षणे रताः॥
शुस्रूषायां रताः शूद्रास् तथा वर्णत्र-
यस्य च।एष धर्मः कृतयुगे … ॥ 3.
189. 12-13); (4) by Bhīṣma to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira (when a king in any Yuga practised
दण्डनीति properly) 12. 70. 8-13 (the quali-
ties of Kṛta age are called कार्तयुगान् गुण्गान्
12. 70. 13, also कार्तयुगधर्माणो भागाः
12. 327. 50); (5) by Saṃjaya to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra 6. 11. 8-9; in general the people of
the Kṛta Yuga were possessed of fortitude,
were diligent in their duties, knew the proper
time for the use of valour (धृतिमन्तश् च
दक्षाश् च स्वे स्वे कर्मणि भारत।परा-
क्रमविधानज्ञा नराः कृतयुगे ऽभवन्)
3. 159. 2; the ascetics of the Kṛta Yuga were
calm and they remained steady in the सत्त्व
quality (तपस्विनः प्रशान्ताश् च सत्त्वस्थाश्
च कृते युगे) 12. 230. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 238. 7: प्रशान्ताः निःसंशयाः); all the
ascetics then made no distinction between
पौरुष, दैव and स्वभाव as the cause
of the success in कर्म and had neither love
nor hatred for the ऋच्स्, the यजुसेस् and the
सामन्स्; hence they practised austerities (and
did not perform sacrifices) अपृथग्दर्शिनः
सर्वे ऋक्सामसु यजुःषु च।कामद्वेषौ
पृथग् दृष्ट्वा तपः कृत उपासते॥) 12.
230. 8 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12.
238. 8: वेदत्रये ऽपि भेदम् अपश्यन्तः
काम्यादीन् पृथक्कृत्य तपो ज्ञानम् उपासते
श्रयन्ति); 12. 224. 63 (Kṛta not mentioned,
but Nī., on Bom. Ed. 12. 232. 33 supplies it:
अद्वैतनिष्ठा मर्त्यास् तप एव योगम् एव
कृतयुगे ऽनुतिष्ठन्तीति शेषः); when Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born the
country of the Kurus (कुरुजाङ्गलम्), the
Kurus themselves and the Kurukṣetra, all
prospered 1. 102. 1; at that time a condition
similar to the Kṛta Yuga prevailed in the
regions of the different kingdoms (प्रदे-
शेष्व् अपि राष्ट्राणां कृतम् युगम् अवर्तत)
1. 102. 5; this condition is described in 1.
102. 2-11; people in the Kṛta Yuga did not
have to cohabit to beget children, they could
have them by mere thought (न चैषां
मैथुनो धर्मो बभूव भरतर्षभ।
संकल्पाद् एव चैतेषाम् अपत्यम् उदपद्-
यत॥) 12. 200. 35; in the Kṛta Yuga evil
tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas etc.
in the south and the Yaunas (Yavanas),
Kāmbojas etc. in the north did not exist on the
earth 12. 200. 39-43; there were no भिक्षुस्
and those who have sectarian marks (लिङ्गि-
नः); similarly there were no alternatives to
the four आश्रमस्; all this happened when the
Kṛta Yuga passed away and the दण्डनीति
was no longer practised—thus Indra told to
Māndhātṛ 12. 65. 24-25.
K. Expecta-
tion of life: In the Kṛta Yuga people were
free from diseases, succeeded in achieving all
objectives and lived for four hundred years
(अरोगाः सर्वसिद्धार्थाश् चतुर्वर्षशता-
युषः।कृते) 12. 224. 24; however, according
to Saṃjaya people lived for four thousand
years (चत्वारि च सहस्राणि वर्षाणां
कुरुसत्तम।आयुःसंख्या कृतयुगे सं-
ख्याता राजसत्तम॥) 6. 11. 5 (apparently
there is confusion between the duration of
the Kṛta Yuga (above section C) and life-
expectancy of human beings); also cf.
सहस्रशतजीविनः ताः प्रजाः … ॥ … एवं
कृतयुगे सम्यग् वर्तमाने तदा नृप)
1. 58. 10, 24; men lived as long as they liked
and they had no fear of Yama 12. 200. 34;
(न क्षीयन्ते च वै प्रजाः) 3. 148. 11;
(नाल्पायुर् दृश्यते नरः) 12. 70. 11; but
the life expectation, virility etc. decrease
successively in the Yugas that follow the
Kṛta (आयुर् वीर्यम् अथो बुद्धिर् … मनु-
ष्याणाम् अनुयुगं ह्रसतीति निबोध मे) 3.
188. 13.
L. Kṛta as the name of Sūrya:
Kṛta appears among the 108 names of Sūrya
taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22.
M. Etymology: The etymology is implied
when it is said that in the Kṛta Yuga
(whatever needs be done) is done and does
not remain undone (कृतम् एव न कर्त-
व्यं तस्मिन् काले युगोत्तमे) 3. 148. 10
[Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 11: कृतम् एव
सर्वे कृतकृत्या एवेत्य् अर्थः।तत एव
हेतोः कृतयुगं नाम॥). [Nī., Bom. Ed.
3. 191. 3, who reads विप्रैश् चोरक्षयश्
चैव कृते क्षेमं भविष्यति in place of
the Cr. Ed. विप्रैश् चोरक्षये चैव कृते (3.
189. 3) interprets कृते युगे; the words कृत,
त्रेता etc. occurring in 5. 140. 7-15 (= Bom.
Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) are interpreted by Nī. as
the Yuga names and not as names of the
throws of dice in a dice game].

कृत्तिका
Kṛttikā f. (pl.): Name of a conste-
llation (the Pleiads); (personified as the
mothers of Skanda, said to be the wives of
the six seers Aṅgiras and others 3. 214.
1-16; 3. 218. 30; 3. 207. 4; 3. 218. 27;
9. 43. 10-13; 9. 45. 86; 13. 84. 76; 13. 86.
5, 8, 10, 13; hence Skanda known as Kārtti-
keya (कृत्तिकाभ्युपपत्तेश् च कार्त्तिकेय इति
स्मृतः) 1. 60. 23; 9. 43. 16; 13. 84. 77; 13.
86. 14, 32).
A. Formation of the constellation:
When the constellation Abbhijit left her place
in the sky and went to the forest to practise
austerities there was confusion in the calcula-
tion of time; Kṛttikās then went up to the
heaven to fill in the gap; there they shine as
a constellation, having the form of a cart,
with god Fire as their regent (एवम् उक्ते तु
शक्रेण त्रिदिवं कृत्तिका गताः।नक्षत्रं
शकटाकारं भाति तद् वह्निदैवतम्॥)
3. 219. 11.
B. Number: Their number
is six 3. 134. 12.
C. Rites performed
under the Kṛttikās: (1) Nārada told Devakī
(13. 63. 2-4) that if one satisfied the Brāh-
maṇas under the Kṛttikās by feeding them
with rice boiled with milk and sprinkled with
clarified butter (पायसेन ससर्पिषा) one
obtained the highest worlds 13. 63. 5; (2)
Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that if
one offered a काम्य श्राद्ध regularly under
the Kṛttikās that was as good as perform-
ing a sacrifice after establishing the fires;
such a person was blessed with progeny and
was free from affliction (विगतज्वरः) 13.
89. 2; (3) By bathing in Māhāgaṅgā at
the conjunction of Mars with the Kṛttikās
(महागङ्गाम् उपस्पृश्य कृत्तिकाङ्गारके
तथा) and by fasting for a fortnight one
was purified and obtained heaven 13. 26. 20;
(4) Aṅgiras told Gautama that if one who
was well composed went on the Urvaśī-
kṛttikāyoga (?) to the Lauhitya तीर्थ and
bathed there according to the rites one
obtained the fruit of performing the Puṇḍa-
rīka sacrifice (उर्वशीकृत्तिकायोगे गत्वा यः
सुसमाहितः।लौहित्ये विधिवत् स्नात्वा
पुण्डरीकफलं लभेत्॥) 13. 26. 43
(Nī. reads उर्वशीं कृत्तिकायोगे (Bom. Ed.
13. 25. 46) and explains: उर्वशीं उर्वशी-
तीर्थं कृत्तिकायोगे कार्तिक्यां पौर्णमा-
स्याम्);
D. Places named after the
Kṛttikās: (1) An आश्रम (आश्रमे कृत्तिका-
नां तु); if one, after bathing at this
आश्रम and delighting Mahādeva, satisfied
the पितृस् he obtained heaven 13. 26. 23;
(2) A तीर्थ named jointly after the
Kṛttikās and the Maghā (कृत्तिकामघयोश्
चैव तीर्थम्); by visiting this तीर्थ one
obtained the fruits of Agniṣṭoma and Atirātra
sacrifices 3. 82. 46.
E. The Kṛttikās
and the sword: When Brahmā created the
sword as a weapon the day was presided over
by the Kṛttikās (कृत्तिकाश् चास्य नक्षत्रम्
असेः) 12. 160. 80.
F. Relationship with
omens: Among the bad omens reported by
Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the war, there
was one according to which the fierce ग्रह
(i. e. Rāhu) blazed in the Kṛttikās, wiped
out their appearance by its lustre and stood
like a comet (कृत्तिकासु ग्रहस् तीव्रो नक्षत्रे
प्रथमे ज्वलन्।वपूंष्य् अपहरन् भासा
धूमकेतुर् इव स्थितः॥) 6. 3. 26 (Nī.
who reads कृत्तिकां पीडयंस् तीक्ष्णैः (Bom.
Ed. 6. 3. 30) explains: तीक्ष्णैः क्रूरैः
कर्मभिर् उपलक्षितो राहुर् इत्य् अर्थः).
G. Simile: The king of the Prāgjyotiṣa
(Bhagadatta), riding on an elephant, was
covered with a parasol decorated with gar-
lands of flowers and hence looking like a
moon on the full moon night in conjunction
with the Kṛttikās (कृत्तिकायोगयुक्तेन
पौर्णमास्याम् इवेन्दुना) 7. 19. 18. [See
Āgneya]

कौमुद
Kaumuda m.; adj.: Name of the month
Kārttika; of the month of Kaumuda.
Described as occurring in the autumn
season (शारद) 13. 116. 70; Kṛṣṇa set out
for Hāstinapura on his peace mission towards
the end of the autumn season and at the ad-
vent of the winter, in the month of Kaumuda,
and under the constellation Revatī (कौमुदे
मासि रेवत्यां शरदन्ते हिमागमे) 5. 81. 7;
according to Bhīṣma, observance of धर्म
consisted in avoiding all kind of meat in the
Kaumuda month, especially in the bright fort-
night (कौमुदे तु विशेषेण शुक्लपक्षे
नराधिप।वर्जयेत् सर्वमांसानि धर्मो
ह्य् अत्र विधीयते) 13. 116. 60; Bhīṣma told
Yudhiṣṭhira that many kings in the past like
Nābhāga, Ambarīṣa and others (13. 116.
65-70) had given up meat in the (bright) fort-
night of the month of Kaumuda (कौमुदं
पक्षम्) 13. 116. 64; they gave up meat in
the month of Kaumuda and attained heaven
13. 116. 70.

कौमुदी
Kaumudī f.: The full moon day of the
Kaumuda month (i. e. of Kārttika).
One who gives food on the full moon day
of the bright half of the month of Kaumuda
gets over difficulties and attains immense
happiness after death (कौमुद्यां शुक्ल-
पक्षे तु यो ऽन्नदानं करोत्य् उत) 13. 65.
60; also a festival celebrated on that day is
called Kaumudī; the demons Sunda and Upa-
sunda, when the two received the boon from
Pitāmaha, observed it out of time with their
friends and fulfilled every desire of the parti-
cipant (अकालकौमुदीं चैव चक्रतुः
सार्वकामिकीम्।दैत्येन्द्रौ परमप्रीतौ
तयोश् चैव सुहृज्जनः) 1. 201. 29.

Bṛhaspati.

चित्रा
Citrā f.: Name of a constellation.
A. Religious rites: (1) Nārada told
Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that if one gave as a
gift a bull and auspicious perfumes under
Citrā (चित्रायाम्) one moved in the world
of the Apsarases and enjoyed in the Nandana-
vana 13. 63. 17; (2) Yama told Śaśabindu
(13. 89. 1) that by offering a काम्य श्राद्ध
under Citrā one got handsome sons 13. 89.
7.
B. Bad omens: (1) Karṇa pointed
out to Kṛṣṇa that the Kauravas were facing
great danger because the planet (Mahāpāta)
was severely afflicting Citrā (नूनं महद्
भयं कृष्ण कुरूणां समुपस्थितम्।
विशेषेण हि वार्ष्णेय चित्रां पीडयते ग्र-
हः॥) 5. 141. 9 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 143.
10: चित्रां ग्रहो महापाताख्यो ज्योतिः-
शास्त्रप्रसिद्धः।तेन राकारस्य वेधाद्
राजजातीयानां क्षयो भवितेति भावः।);
(2) Among the bad omens pointed out by
Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra there was one according
to which a Śvetagraha (also called a harsh
ग्रह = Ketu) had gone beyond Citrā and
was at the beginning of Svāti (श्वेतो ग्रहस्
तथा चित्रां समतिक्रम्य तिष्ठति) 6. 3. 11
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 12: श्वेतो ग्रहः
केतुश् चित्राम् अतिक्रामति स्वात्यादौ वर्तते);
(चित्रास्वात्यन्तरे चैव धिष्ठितः परुषो
ग्रहः) 6. 3. 16.

चैत्र
Caitra m.: Name of a month.
Aṅgiras had told Bhīṣma (13. 109. 9-
10) that if one, with restrained mind, spent
the month of Caitra eating only once a day
he was born in a noted family that was rich
with gold, gems and pearls 13. 109. 22;
Nārada told the Pāṇḍavas that Brahmadeva
and other gods, the Seers, the Siddhas and the
Cāraṇas visit the famous and very holy con-
fluence of the river Sarasvatī where Janārdana
was worshipped (सङ्गमं लोकविश्रुतम्।
सरस्वत्या महापुण्यम् उपासन्ते जनार्-
दनम्॥ 3. 80. 130) on the fourteenth day
of the bright half of Caitra (3. 80. 131);
if a king was threatened by a stronger adver-
sary (12. 69. 32) he should, in the month
of Caitra when there was fear of fire, get in
advance all houses, that were covered with
grass, smeared with mud and remove the
grass from them (तृणच्छन्नानि वेश्मानि
पङ्केनापि प्रलेपयेत्।निर्हरेच् च तृणं
मासे चैत्रे वह्निभयात् पुरः) 12. 69. 45.

चैत्री
Caitrī f.; adj.: Name of the day of the
full moon in the month of Caitra; occurring

पौर्णमास्यां च तव दीक्षा भविष्यति)
14. 71. 4; after defeating Vajradatta, son of
Bhagadatta of the Prāgjyotiṣa, Arjuna invited
him to attend the Aśvamedha sacrifice of
Dharmarāja which would take place on the
following full moon day of Caitra (आगच्-
छेत्था महाराज परां चैत्रीम् उपस्थि-
ताम्।तदाश्वमेधो भविता धर्मराजस्य
धीमतः) 14. 75. 25; he similarly invited
Babhruvāhana 14. 82. 24, Meghasaṃdhi
(grandson of Jarāsaṃdha, son of Sahadeva)
14. 83. 27, and Śakuni's son 14. 85. 23;
marching out of an army for attack is re-
commended on the full moon day of Caitra
or Mārgaśīrṣa for the crops are then ripe and
there is ample water; it is also then neither
too hot nor too cold (चैत्र्यां वा मार्ग-
शीर्ष्यां वा सेनायोगः प्रशस्यते।पक्व-
सस्या हि पृथिवी भवत्य् अम्बुमती तथा॥
नैवातिशीतो नात्युष्णः कालो भवति भारत।
तस्मात् तदा योजयेत) 12. 101. 9-10.

जय
Jaya m.: Name of a मुहूर्त।
Drupada asked his Purohita, whom he
dispatched as his दूत to the Kauravas, to

ज्येष्ठा
Jyeṣṭhā f.: Name of a constellation,
also called Aindra (1. 114. 4; 6. 3. 15).
A. Epic event related to this नक्षत्र:
Kuntī gave birth to Yudhiṣṭhira on the day
when the moon was in conjunction with the
Aindra नक्षत्र (लेभे पुत्रं वरारोहा
 … ऐन्द्रे चन्द्रसमायुक्ते) 1. 114. 3-4
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 123. 6: ऐन्द्रे ज्ये-
ष्ठानक्षत्रे अष्टमे संवत्सरारम्भात्).
B. Religious rites performed under this
नक्षत्र: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63.
2-4) that if one gave to the Brāhmaṇas
कालशाक with roots under Jyeṣṭhā one ob-
tained prosperity wished for and cherished
condition after death (कालशाकं तु विप्रे-
भ्यो दत्त्वा मर्त्यः समूलकम्।ज्येष्ठा-
याम् ऋद्धिम् इष्टां वै गतिम् इष्टां च
विन्दति) 13. 63. 23; Yama told Śaśabindu
(13. 89. 1) that if a man, with faith and
self-control, offered a काम्य श्राद्ध under
Jyeṣṭhā he got overlordship (आधिपत्यं
व्रजेन् मर्त्यः) 13. 89. 9.
C. Bad
omens: Among the bad omens pointed out
by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra there was one
according to which the blazing black planet
(i. e. Ketu), full of fire and smoke, had taken
hold of Jyeṣṭhā, which was the bright Aindra
नक्षत्र, and had remained there (श्यामो
ग्रहः प्रज्वलितः सधूमः सहपावकः।
ऐन्द्रं तेजस्वि नक्षत्रं ज्येष्ठाम् आक्र-
म्य तिष्ठति) 6. 3. 15 (Nī., who reads श्वेतो
ग्रहः in place of श्यामो ग्रहः, on Bom.
Ed. 6. 3. 16 also explains it as Ketu: श्वेतो
द्वितीय उपरहः केतुसंज्ञः ऐन्द्रं
ज्येष्ठानक्षत्रम् इति योज्यम्; among the
bad omens pointed out by Karṇa to Kṛṣṇa one
was related to the retrograde movement of
Mars in Jyeṣṭhā and his coveting Anurādhā
as though thereby tranquilizing the Maitra
Nakṣatrayoga (कृत्वा चाङ्गारको वक्रं
ज्येष्ठायां मधुसूदन।अनुराधां
प्रार्थयते मैत्रं संशमयन्न् इव॥)
5. 141. 8 (For Nī.'s commentary on Bom.
Ed. 5. 143. 9 See under Aṅgāraka, p. 229
above).

ज्येष्ठामूल
Jyeṣṭhāmūla m.: Name of the month
Jyaiṣṭha.
A. Religious rite performed in this
month: Aṅgiras had told Bhīṣma that if
a man or a woman passed the Jyeṣṭhāmūla
month eating only once a day, he or she
attained to prosperity which was incomparable
and best 13. 109. 24 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
13. 106. 25: ज्येष्थामूलं ज्येष्ठमासम्).
B. Past event connected with this month:
Jamadagni shot arrows at midday in the
month Jyeṣṭhāmūla and asked his wife
Reṇukā to fetch them (ततो मध्याह्नम्
आरूढे ज्येष्ठामूले दिवाकरे।स सायकान्
द्विजो विद्ध्वा रेणुकाम् इदम् अब्रवीत्॥
गच्छानय विशालाक्षि शरान् एतान् धनु-
श्च्युतान्) 13. 97. 9-10 (Unknown commen-
tator: ज्येष्ठामूले ज्येष्ठमासे ज्येष्ठमा-
सस्य मध्याह्ने अतितीक्ष्णः [दिवाकरः] इति
सूचितम्। (cf. Cr. Edn. vol. 17, p. 1097, note
on this stanza; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed.
13. 95. 9: ज्येष्ठामूले दक्षिणावर्ते भ्र-
ममाणे भचक्रे ज्येष्ठानां समसूत्रे
पतितं रोहिणीनक्षत्रं तद् एव ज्येष्ठा-
नां मूलम्।यथाश्रुतार्थग्रहणं तु

त्रेता
Tretā f., Tretāyuga nt.: Name of the
second Yuga among the four Yugas.
A. Place among the four Yugas:
Second, occurs after Kṛta, hence mentioned
after it (पूर्वं कृतयुगं नाम ततस्
त्रेतायुगं विभो) 6. 11. 4; 6. 11. 3; 12.
224. 18; 12. 323. 50-51; after Tretā follows
Dvāpara (त्रेतानिर्मोक्षसमये द्वापर-
प्रतिपादने) 12. 139. 14; hence the junction
of these two युगस् is referred to (त्रेता-
द्वापरयोः सन्धौ) 1. 2. 3; 12. 139. 13;
12. 326. 78.
B. Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya
told Yudhiṣṭhira that the duration of the
Tretā Yuga was three thousand years, with
dawns of three hundred years and twilights
of the same duration (त्रीणि वर्षसहस्राणि
त्रेतायुगम् इहोच्यते।तस्य तावच्छती
संध्या संध्यांशस् च ततः परम्॥ …
संध्यासंध्यांशयोस् तुल्यं प्रमाणम्
उपधारय) 3. 186. 19, 21 (for Nī.'s ex-
planation of संध्या and संध्यांश, see
Kali, Section C); the same duration was
told by Vyāsa to Śuka without specifically
naming the Yuga but in relation to Kṛta
(इतरेषु ससंध्येषु ससंध्यांशेषु च
त्रिषु।एकापायेन संयान्ति सहस्राणि शतानि
च॥) 12. 224. 20.
C. Events: (1)
Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that in
the Tretāyuga, (first), he will be born as
Rāma in the family of the Bhṛgus and will
destroy the Kṣatriyas; and, (next), when the
junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara will
have arrived he will be born as Rāma, son
of Daśaratha, to be the king of the world
(त्रेतायुगे भविष्यामि रामो भृगुकुलोद्-
वहः।क्षत्रं चोत्सादयिष्यामि … ॥सं-
धौ तु समनुप्राप्ते त्रेतायां द्वापर्-
अस्य च।रामो दाशर्थिर् भूत्वा भवि-
ष्यामि जगत्पतिः॥) 12. 326. 77-78; 1. 2. 3;
(2) A being without bodily form informed
from the sky (12. 323. 46) Ekata, Dvita
and Trita that when the Kṛtayuga had passed
and the Tretāyuga of the 7th मन्वन्तर
presided over by Manu Vaivasvata will have
arrived they will work as helpers of gods
for achieving a great purpose (वैवस्वते
ऽन्तरे विप्राः प्राप्ते त्रेतायुगे ततः।
सुराणां कार्यसिद्ध्यर्थं सहाया वै
भविष्यथ) 12. 323. 51; (cf. 12. 326. 79-
80); (3) Vyāsa told Yudhiṣṭhira that
Karaṃdhama's son (Avikṣit) was born at
the commencement of the Tretāyuga—he
was glorious, not inferior to Indra, and invin-
cible even by the gods 14. 4. 17; (4) Bhīṣma
told Yudhiṣṭhira that formerly at the junction
of the Tretā and the Dvāpara, a terrible
drought, lasting for twelve years, occurred
due to the working of the fate (दैवविधि-
क्रमात्) 12. 139. 13; when the Tretā was
about to end and the Dvāpara was about
to set in and when the end of the eon was at
hand Indra did not release rain (युगान्ते पर्-
युपस्थिते।त्रेतानिर्मोक्षसमये द्वापर-
प्रतिपादने॥न ववर्ष सहस्राक्षः)
12. 139. 14-15.
D. Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa and
Tretā: Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārka-
ṇḍeya that his colour in the Tretāyuga was
yellow (पीतस् त्रेतायुगे मम) 3. 187. 31;
but according to Hanūmant, Acyuta was
red in the Tretā (रक्ततां याति चाच्युतः)
3. 148. 23; Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that
Kṛṣṇa conformed to ज्ञान in the Tretā
(त्रेताकाले ज्ञानम् अनुप्रपन्नः) 13. 143.
9 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 158. 10: ज्ञानम्
अकर्तव्यकोटेर् अपि उपस्थानात् त्रेतायां
विवेक आसीत्).
E. King and Tretā: When
the king observes दण्डनीति only in three
parts and leaves out the fourth, the Tretā-
yuga sets in; the place of the fourth part is
then made up by what is inauspicious and this
part gets associated with the other three,
hence the earth has to be ploughed for the
growth of the plants (दण्डनीत्या यदा राजा
त्रीन् अंशान् अनुवर्तते।चतुर्थम् अंशम्
उत्सृज्य तदा त्रेता प्रवर्तते॥अशुभस्य
चतुर्थांशस् त्रीन् अंशान् अनुवर्तते।कृष्ट-
पच्यैव पृथिवी भवन्त्योषध्यस् तथा॥)
12. 70. 14-15; (पादोनेनापि धर्मेण गच्-
छेत् त्रेतायुगे तथा) 12. 259. 32; a king is
the cause of the Tretā (as also of the other
three Yugas) (त्रेतायाः … । … राजा भवति
कारणम्) 5. 130. 16 = 12. 70. 25; (also cf.
राजा कालस्य कारणम् 12. 70. 6 = 5. 130. 15);
Tretā, like the other three Yugas, depends
on the conduct of the king and hence the
king is called a Yuga (राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि
राजैव युगम् उच्यते) 12. 92. 6; (राज-
मूलानि सर्वाणि) 12. 139. 10; a king obtains
heaven, but not endlessly, because he intro-
duces Tretā (त्रेतायाः करणाद् राजा स्वर्गं
नात्यन्तम् अश्नुते) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70. 26;
description of the people in the Tretā in the
absence of दण्डनीति 12. 65. 24-27;
F. Tretā and धर्म: In the Tretāyuga
Dharma loses one of its four feet (तत्र
(i. e. त्रेतायुगे) पादचतुर्थो वै धर्म्-
अस्य न भविष्यति) 12. 327. 74; (पादेन
ह्रसते धर्मः) 3. 148. 22-23; in the
Tretā, Dharma is established in three parts
and the remaining one part is affected by
अधर्म (अधर्मपादविद्धस् तु त्रिभिर्
अंशैः प्रतिष्ठितः।त्रेतायाम्) 3. 188. 11;
also of 12. 259. 32; in the Tretā and the
other two following Yugas the धर्म is
displaced from tradition successively by one
quarter and the अधर्म is on increase due
to thefts, falsehood and deceit (इतरेष्व्
(i. e. युगेषु) आगमाद् धर्मः पादशस्
त्व् अवरोप्यते।चौरिकानृतमायाभिर्
अधर्मश् चोपचीयते) 12. 224. 23; the
धर्मस् in the Tretā were different from
those in the Kṛta 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;
ज्ञान was considered to be the best धर्म
for the Tretā (त्रेतायां ज्ञानम् उत्तमम्)
12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that times
in the different Yugas were different 3. 148.
6; Vyāsa told his son Śuka that he had
heard that the study of the Vedas decreased
in every following Yuga and so also the
benefit derived by people from the Veda
(वेदवादाश् चानुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति च नः
श्रुतम्। … वेदस्यैव च यत् फलम्) 12.
224. 25; the Sātvata धर्म, which flourished
in the Kṛtayuga of the fourth birth of Brah-
man (12. 336. 25), disappeared when the
Tretā returned (ततः सो ऽन्तर्दधे भूयः
प्राप्ते त्रेतायुगे पुनः) 12. 336. 35; but
in the seventh birth of Brahman (12. 336.
44) the same Sātvata धर्म was taught
by Vivasvān to Manu 12. 326. 47; according
to Mārkaṇḍeya, however, the धर्म for
the Kṛta, the Tretā and the Dvāpara was
the same 3. 189. 13.
G. Tretā and the
sacrifice: There were no sacrifices in the
Kṛtayuga, but they all, very strong, collected
together appeared in the Tretā and be-
came controllers of those that move (living
beings) and those that do not (non-living
beings) (त्रेतायुगे विधिस् त्व् एषां यज्ञानां
न कृते युगे … त्रेतायां तु समस्तास् ते
प्रादुरासन् महाबलाः।संयन्तारः
स्थावराणां जङ्गमानां च सर्वशः॥
त्रेतायां संहता ह्य् एते यज्ञाः … ) 12.
224. 62, 64, 65 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed.
12. 232. 34: त्रेतायां धर्मे नृणां स्वतः
प्रवृत्त्यभावात् तत्र संयन्तारो धर्म-
शास्तारो वेदाश् च संहता यज्ञाद्यनुष्ठा-
पनाय सन्नद्धा आसन्); Bhagavān (Nārā-
yana) told the gods that the three Vedas
will rule the Tretāyuga and then the animals,
consecrated for the sacrifice, will be killed
(ततस् त्रेतायुगं नाम त्रयी यत्र भवि-
ष्यति।प्रोक्षिता यत्र पशव वधं
प्राप्स्यन्ति वै मखे।) 12. 327. 74;
(त्रेताम् अपि निबोध त्वम् यस्मिन् सत्रं
प्रवर्तते) 3. 148. 22; (ततो यज्ञाः प्र-
वर्तन्ते धर्माश् च विविधाः क्रियाः।
त्रेतायां भावसंकल्पाः क्रियादानफलो-
दयाः॥) 3. 148. 24 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3.
149. 23: सत्रं यज्ञक्रिया रजोमिश्रत्वात्;
on 3. 149. 25: भावसंकल्पाः भावो
भावना क्रिया अहम् अनेन कर्मणा
इदं फलं अनेन प्रकारेण करिष्यामीत्य्
एवंरूपा तद्विषय एव संकल्पो येषाम्);
Vyāsa told Śuka that at the commencement
of the Tretā the Vedas and the sacrifices
are complete in form (त्रेतादौ सकला वेदा
यज्ञा वर्णाश्रामास् तथा) 12. 230. 14;
(also cf. Maheśvara (Viṣṇu) recommending
the performance of sacrifices for the benefit of
gods, and the gods, on their part, sustaining
the worlds in the Yugas (not named) other
than the Kṛta 12. 327. 53-60).
H. Nature
of the Tretāyuga: Hanūmant told Bhīma
that the times in the Tretā were different from
those in the Kṛta (अन्यः कृतयुगे कालस्
त्रेतायां द्वापरे ऽपरः) 3. 148. 6; Hanū-
mant then described to Bhīma the condition
of the world in the Tretāyuga 3. 148. 22-25
(men are truthful (सत्यप्रवऋत्ताश् च नराः),
they do not deviate from the path of धर्म,
are given to the practice of austerities and to
giving gifts); the Tretāyuga also described
by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Kṣatriyas are
long-lived, they are great warriors, excellent
archers in war, brave and emperors) 6. 11. 10
(जायन्ते क्षत्रियाः शूरास् त्रेतायां चक्र-
वर्तिनः); according to Mārkaṇḍeya the
condition of धर्म in the Tretā is not
different from the one in the Kṛta described
by him (एष धर्मः कृतयुगे त्रेआयाम्)
3. 189 13; the ascetics in the Tretā, who
are steady in the सत्त्व गुण, have no
doubt whatever whether पुरुष, दैव
or स्वभाव is the cause of a man's success
in his activities; they see no distinction,
as same people for want of judgement do,
between them (पौरुषं कारणं केचिद्
आहुः कर्मसु मानवाः।दविअम् एके
प्रशंसन्ति स्वभावं चापरे जनाः॥ …
त्रयम् एतत् पृथग्भूतम् अविवेकं तु
केचन। … कर्मस्था विषमं ब्रूयुः
सत्त्वस्थाः समदर्शिनः॥ त्रेतायां …
तपस्विनः … ) 12. 230. 4, 6-7; in the Tretā,
as in the Kṛta, people could get progeny by
mere thought and did not have to cohabit
for this purpose (तत्र त्रेतायुगे काले सं-
कल्पाज् जायते प्रजा।न ह्य् अभूत् मैथुनो
धर्मस् तेषाम् अपि नराधिप॥) 12. 200.
36; evil tribes like the Talavaras, the
Andhrakas and others in the south and the
Yaunas (Yavanas), the Kāmbojas and others
in the north, unlike in the Kṛtayuga, begin
to roam about on the surface of the
earth from the Tretāyuga onwards (नैते
कृतयुगे तात चरन्ति पृथिवीम् इमाम्।
त्रेताप्रभृति वर्तन्ते ते जना भरतर्-
षभ॥) 12. 200. 42.
I. Span of life:
Vyāsa told Śuka that people in each suc-
ceeding Yuga lived a quarter years less
than those in the Kṛtayuga who lived for
four hundred years, i. e. in the Tretā they
lived for three hundred years (चतुर्वर्ष-
शतायुषः।कृते त्रेतादिष्व् एतेषां पादशो
ह्रसते वयः) 12. 224. 24; Vyāsa had heard
that life gradually decreased in each succes-
sive Yuga (अनुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति च नः
श्रुतम्।आयूंषि) 12. 224. 25; the same
thing was told by Mārkaṇḍeya to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira (आयुर् वीर्यम् अथो बुद्धिर् बलं
तेजश् च पाण्डव।मनुष्याणाम् अनुयुगं
ह्रसतीति निबोध मे) 3. 188. 13; however,
Saṃjaya, told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that people lived
for three thousand years in the Tretā (आयुः-
संख्या … संख्याता राजसत्तम।तथा
त्रीणि सहस्राणि त्रेतायां मनुजाधिप॥)
6. 11. 5-6 (apparently, in Saṃjaya's narra-
tion, there is confusion between the dura-
tion of the Tretāyuga (cf. section
B. above)
and the life expectancy of the people in this
Yuga).
J. Simile: The region where
the river Narmadā (f.) passes along the
Vaiḍūrya mountain (m.) is compared with
the conjunction of the Tretā (f.) and the
Dvāpara (m) (वैडूर्यपर्वतं दृष्ट्वा
नर्मदाम् अवतीर्य च।सन्धिर् एष नर-
श्रेष्ठ त्रेताया द्वापरस्य च॥) 3. 121.
18-19.
K. Name of Sūrya: Tretā
appears as the 47th name among the hundred
and eight names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya
to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words Kṛta,
Tretā and Dvāpara occurring in 5. 140. 7-
15 are wrongly interpreted by Nī. (Bom.
Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the three
Yugas and not as the names of the throws
of dice in a dice-game].

दक्षिणायन
Dakṣiṇāyana nt.: Name of the period
of six months in which the sun moves towards
the south (also expressed as दक्षिणावृत्त
आदित्ये 6. 114. 96).
A. Duration: It lasts for six months
(षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम्) 6. 30. 25.
B.
Association with darkness: Vyāsa told Śuka
that Dakṣiṇāyaṇa formed the night of the
gods (रात्रिः स्याद् दक्षिणायनम्) 12. 224.
16; Dakṣiṇāyana is associated with blind
darkness and the dark night (अन्धं तमस्
तमिस्रं च दक्षिणायनम् एव च) 13.
101. 46.
C. Bhīṣma's falling down in the
Dakṣiṇāyana and his death in the Uttarā-
yaṇa: When Bhīṣma fell down on the battle-
field he heard a heavenly voice in the mid-
region resounding all around saying “how
should the high-souled Gāṅgeya (Bhīṣma)
die when it was Dakṣiṇāyana ?” (कथं
महात्मा गाङ्गेयः … ।कालं कर्ता नर-
व्याघ्रः संप्राप्ते दक्षिणायने) 6. 114.
88; the great sages who, in the form of the
swans, were sent by Gaṅgā observed that the
sun was in the south when Bhīṣma fell from
the chariot (दक्षिणेन च भास्करम् 6. 114.
93); they said to each other: (it seems)
Bhīṣma, though high-souled, shall die when
it was Dakṣiṇāyaṇa (इतरेतरम् आमन्त्र्य
प्राहुस् तत्र मनीषिणः।भीष्म एव महा-
त्मा सन् संस्थाता दक्षिणायने॥) 6. 114.
94 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 119. 102: सं-
स्थाता मरिष्यति); Bhīṣma then assured the
sages that he had resolved that in no case
would he go (from this world) when the
sun was turned towards the south (तान्
अब्रवीच् छान्तनवो नाहं गन्ता कथं-
चन।दक्षिणावृत्त आदित्ये एतन् मे मनसि
स्थितम्॥) 6. 114. 96; Yudhiṣṭhira became
anxious when the realized that Bhīṣma had only
a few days to live in the Dakṣiṇāyana and
that he would soon leave for the highest state
when the sun had started moving (north-
wards) (शेषम् अल्पं द्मानां ते दक्षिणा-
यनभास्करे।आवृत्ते भगवत्य् अर्के गन्त्-
आसि परमां गतिम्॥) 12. 291. 4; the period
of Dakṣiṇāyaṇa, when Bhīṣma fell, is alluded
to in Bhīṣma's instruction to Yudhiṣṭhira to
come back to him when the sun had return-
ed (from the southerly course) (विनिवृत्ते
दिनकरे) 13. 152. 10; it is also alluded to
when Yudhiṣṭhira returned to meet Bhīṣma
(दृष्ट्वा निवृत्तम् आदित्यम् प्रवृत्तं चोत्तरा-
यणम्) 13. 153. 6; when Bhīṣma, on seeing
Yudhiṣṭhira, greeted him and said that the sun
had, indeed, returned (from the southerly
course) (परिवृत्तो हि भगवान् सहस्रांशुर्
दिवाकरः) 13. 153. 26; and when Bhīṣma,
composed in attitude, put his entire bodily
function in his self as soon as the sun had
returned (from the south) (निवृत्तमात्रे त्व्
अयने उत्तरे वै दिवाकरे।समावेशयद्
आत्मानम् आत्मन्य् एव समाहितः॥) 12. 47.
3; Bhīṣma finally died when the sun left the
southerly course and the Uttarāyaṇa had start-
ed (अकरोत् स ततः कालं शरतल्पगतो
मुनिः॥अयनं दक्षिणं हित्वा संप्राप्ते
चोत्तरायणे॥) 14. 59. 12.
D. Death in
the Dakṣiṇāyana: If a Yogī dies during the six
months of the Dakṣiṇāyana he, after reaching
the moon's realm of light, returns to this
world (षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम्।तत्र चान्-
द्रमसं ज्योतिर् योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते॥)
6. 30. 25; Nārada, while consoling Sṛñjaya
lamenting over the death of his son, told
him that Ambarīṣa, son of Nābhāga, and
hundreds of other kings who performed the
Aśvamedha, went towards the Dakṣiṇāyana
(i. e. died during the Dakṣiṇāyana) (सर्वे
ऽश्वमेधैर् ईजानास् ते ऽभ्ययुर् दक्षिणाय-
नम्) 12. 29. 96; (Nī., however, who reads
अन्वयुः, on Bom. Ed. 12. 29. 103: सर्वे
राजानः … दक्षिणायनम् अनु पश्चात् अयुर्
गताः।उत्तरायणमार्गेण हिरण्यगर्भ-
लोकं प्राप्ताः इत्य् अर्थः); but men who
perform bad deeds and who die in the
Dakṣiṇāyana wait upon Dharmarāja (Yama)
in his सभा (नरा दुष्कृतकर्माणो दक्षि-
णायनमृत्यवः। … उपासते धर्मराजम्)
2. 8. 28-29. [For most of the information
which is common to both the अयनस् the
Uttara and the Dakṣiṇa, see Uttarāyaṇa].

देवयुग
Devayuga nt.: See Kṛtayuga.

द्वापर
Dvāpara m., nt.: Name of the third
Yuga among the four Yugas.
A. Place among the four Yugas:
Its place is third, mentioned after the Tretā
and before the Kali (कृतं त्रेता द्वा-
परं च पुष्यं च कुरुवर्धन) 6.
11. 3; 12. 224. 18; the Dvāpara starts
when the Tretā ends (त्रेतानिर्मोक्षसमये
द्वापरप्रतिपादने) 12. 139. 14; and
the Kali starts when the Dvāpara ends
(सङ्क्षेपाद् द्वापरस्याथ ततः पुष्यं
प्रवर्तते) 6. 11. 4; hence also the junctions
of the Tretā and the Dvāpara on the one
hand and of the Dvāpara and the Kali
on the other are referred to 1. 2. 3; 12.
139. 13; 12. 326. 78; 1. 2. 9; 12. 326. 82.
B. Duration: Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira
that the duration of the Dvāpara Yuga was
two thousand years with dawns and twilights
of two hundred years each at both ends (तथा
वर्षसहस्रे द्वे द्वापरं परिमाणतः।
तस्यापि द्विशती संध्या संध्यांशस् च
ततः परम्॥संध्यासंध्यांशयोस् तुल्-
यं प्रमाणम् उपधारय) 3. 186. 20-
21 (for Nī's explanation of संध्या and
संध्यांश see above Kali, section C,
p. 234); the same duration for the Dvāpara
was told by Vyāsa to Śuka without naming
the Yuga, but indicating it in relation to the
Kṛta 12. 224. 20.
C. Events occurring
in the Dvāpara: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that formerly, at the junction of the
Tretā and the Dvāpara, there occurred a
terrible drought lasting for twelve years due
to the working of the fate (दैवविधि-
क्रमात्); when the Tretā was about to end
and the Dvāpara was to set in Indra did
not release rain for twelve years (त्रेतानिर्-
मोक्षसमये द्वापरप्रतिपादने॥न
ववर्ष सहस्राक्षः) 12. 139. 13-15; (2)
Sūta Ugraśravas told the sages assembled in
the Naimiṣa forest that at the junction of
the Tretā and the Dvāpara (त्रेताद्वापरयोः
संधौ) Rāma destroyed the princely
Kṣatriyas again and again 1. 2. 3 (but
see the next event); (3) Bhagavān (Nārā-
yaṇa) told Nārada that at the junction
of the Tretā and the Dvāpara (संधौ
तु समनुप्राप्ते त्रेतायां द्वापरस्य
च) he would be born as Rāma, son of
Daśaratha 12. 326. 78; (4) Bhagavān
(Nārāyaṇa) told Nārada that towards the end
of the junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali
(द्वापरस्य कलेश् चैव संधौ पर्यव-
सानिके) he would be born in Mathurā for (the
killing of) Kaṃsa 12. 326. 82; (5) at the
junction of the Dvāpara and the Kali the
armies of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas fought
each other near Samantapañcaka 1. 2. 9.
D.
Kṛṣṇa-Nārāyaṇa (Viṣṇu) and the Dvāpara:
(1) Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) told Mārka-
ṇḍeya that he has red colour in the Dvāpara
Yuga (रक्तो द्वापरम् आसाद्य) 3. 187. 31;
but according to Hanūmant Viṣṇu becomes
yellow in the Dvāpara (द्वापरे ऽपि युगे …
विष्णुर् वै पीततां याति) 3. 148. 26; (3)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that Kṛṣṇa was
strength in the Dvāpara (बलं त्व् आसीद् द्वा-
परे पार्थ कृष्णः) 13. 143. 9.
E. King
and the Dvāpara: According to Utathya
Aṅgiras all the four Yugas depend on the
king's behaviour, hence a king himself is
called Yuga (राजवृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजैव
युगम् उच्यते) 12. 92. 6; Bhīṣma had no
doubt that all the Yugas were rooted in
a king (राजमूलानि सर्वाणि मम नास्त्य्
अत्र संशयः) 12. 139. 10; it is the king
who created a Yuga—whether it was the
Kṛta, the Tretā, or the Dvāpara 5. 130. 16 =
12. 70. 25 (also cf. राजा कालस्य कारणम्
5. 130. 15 = 12. 70. 6); when a king gives
up half of the दण्डनीति and practises only
one half of it, then the Dvāpara age sets
in (अर्धं त्यक्त्वा यदा राजा नीत्यर्धम्
अनुवर्तते।ततस् तु द्वापरं नाम स
कालः संप्रवर्तते॥) 12. 70. 16; the
धर्म practised by the king in the Dvāpara
is deficient in two quarters (द्वापरे तु
द्विपादेन (ऊनः)) 12. 259. 32; by bringing
about the Dvāpara a king lives in heaven
only according to his share (i. e. not for a long
time) (प्रवर्तनाद् द्वापरस्य (स्वर्गम्)
यथाभागम् य्पाश्नुते) 5. 130. 17 = 12. 70.
27; (description of the behaviour of people in
the Dvāpara in the absence of the दण्डनीति
12. 65. 24-27).
F. Dvāpara and धर्म:
In the Dvāpara Yuga, धर्म will lose two
of its four feet and the age will be marked
by a mixture (of धर्म and अधर्म)
(ततो वै द्वापरं नाम मिश्रः कालो
भविष्यति।द्विपादहीनो धर्मश् च युगे
तस्मिन् भविष्यति) 12. 327. 75; (द्वापरे
ऽर्धेन व्यामिश्रो धर्म उच्यते) 3. 188.
11 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 190. 10: अर्धेन
अधर्मेण); (अशुभस्य तदा अर्धं द्वाव्
अंशाव् अनुवर्तते) 12. 70. 17; (द्वापरे ऽपि
युगे धर्मो द्विभागोनः प्रवर्तते) 3.
148. 26; 12. 259. 32; in the Yugas that
follow the Kṛta the traditional धर्म is
displaced successively by one quarter and in-
stead अधर्म increases due to the practice
of theft, falsehood and deceit 12. 224. 23; the
धर्मस् in the Dvāpara are different from
those in the Kṛta and the Tretā 12. 224. 26 =
12. 252. 8; according to Mārkaṇḍeya, however,
the धर्म for the Kṛta, the Tretā and the
Dvāpara was the same (एष ढर्मः कृत-
युगे त्रेतायां द्वापरे तथा) 3. 189. 13;
sacrifice was considered to be the best धर्म
for the Dvāpara (द्वापरे यज्ञम् एवाहुः
(उत्तमम्)) 12. 224. 27; Hanūmant told
Bhīma that the times in different Yugas were
different; he and Bhīma lived at a time when
the Dvāpara was about to end and hence he
could not assume the form he had taken in
the earlier Yuga (अयं प्रध्वंसनः कालो
नाद्य तद् रूपम् अस्ति मे) 3. 148. 6;
Kṛṣṇa-Vāsudeva, along with Saṃkaraṣṇa, is
praised following the Sātvata rites when the
Dvāpara ends, and the Kali begins (द्वाप-
रस्य युगस्यान्ते आदौ कलियुगस्य च।
सात्वतं विधिं आस्थाय गीतः संकर्षणेन
यः (i. e. कृष्णः) 6. 62. 39.
G. Dvāpara,
sacrifice and the Vedas: Vyāsa told his son
Śuka that on account of the limitation on the
life expectancy (of human beings) sacrifices,
in the Dvāparayuga, get into disarray (संर्च्-
धाद् आयुषस् त्व् एते (i. e. यज्ञाः) व्यस्यन्ते
द्वापरे युगे) 12. 224. 65 = 12. 230. 14;
they fall into ruin (द्वापरे विप्लवं यान्ति
यज्ञाः) 12. 224. 62 = 12. 230. 15 (विप्लवं
यान्ति वेदाः); however, sacrifice considered
to be the best धर्म for the Dvāpara
(द्वापरे यज्ञम् एवाहुः (उत्तमम्) 12.
224. 27; Hanūmant told Bhīma that in the
Dvāpara the Veda is foretold; hence some
study all the four Vedas, others three, two,
or one; but some do not study a single ऋच्; as
men did not realize the sacred text to be one
Veda, the Veda was divided into many
(Vedas) (द्वापरे ऽपि युगे … चतुर्धा
वेद एव च॥ततो ऽन्ये च चतुर्वेदास्
त्रिवेदाश् च तथापरे।द्विवेदाश् चैकवेदाश्-
चाप्य् अनृचश् च तथापरे॥ … एकवेदस्य
चाज्ञानाद् वेदास् ते बहवः कृताः) 3. 148.
26-27, 29 (Nī., on Bom. Ed. 3. 149. 28,
offers an alternative explanation: यद् वा
चतुर्वेदा इति वेदत्रयोक्तं कर्म ज्योतिष्टो-
मादिकम्।अथर्वणोपनिषदुक्तम् ध्या-
नं च सहैव वानुतिष्ठन्तीति कर्मोपास्ति-
समुच्चय उक्तः।त्रिवेदा इति केवलकर्-
मठाः।द्विवेदा इति स्वशाखोक्तं सं-
ध्यावन्दनादि कर्म ध्यानं चानुति-
ष्ठन्ति।एकवेदा ध्यानैकनिष्ठाः।
अनृचः कृतकृत्याः।); (also cf. Maheśvara
(Viṣṇu) recommending the performance of
sacrifices to satisfy the gods and the gods,
on their part, sustaining the worlds in the
(three) Yugas other than the Kṛta 12. 327.
53-60).
H. Nature: According to the
description of the Dvāpara given by Hanū-
mant to Bhīma, since in that age the Vedas
become fourfold and the शास्त्रस् multiply,
the Vedic rites are variously performed;
people, given to austerities and gifts, become
राजस by nature; since truth falls down,
rarely any one abides by truth (एवं
शास्त्रेषु भिन्नेषु बहुधा नियते कृइया।
तपोदानप्रवृत्ता च राजसी भवति प्रजा॥
 … सत्यस्य चेह विभ्रंशात् सत्ये कश्चिद्
अवस्थितः॥) 3. 148. 28-29; for further
description of the Dvāpara cf. 3. 148. 30-31;
Hanūmant concludes that people in the
Dvāpara perish due to the practice of
अधर्म (एवं द्वापरम् आसाद्य प्रजाः
क्षीयन्त्य् अधर्मतः) 3. 148. 32; according
to Saṃjaya, in the Dvāpara all the four
वर्णस् are full of energy; they are great
heroes, desirous of killing each other; on the
whole, the Dvāpara in which Saṃjaya lived
was characterized by contraction (of the me-
rits in all respects) (सर्ववर्णा महाराज
जायन्ते द्वापरे सति।महोत्साहा महावीर्-
याः परस्परवधैषिणः॥ … संक्षेपो
वर्तते राजन् द्वापरे ऽस्मिन् नराधिप)
6. 11. 11, 14 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 10. 15:
संक्षेपो गुणानाम् इति शेषः); Vyāsa told
Śuka that all the वर्णस् and the आश्रमस्
fall into disarray due to the limitation on
the life-span (वर्णाश्रमास् तथा।संर्च्-
धाद् आयुषस् त्व् एते व्यस्यन्ते द्वापरे
युगे) 12. 230. 14; he also said that people
in the Dvāpara (as in the Tretā and the Kali)
entertain doubt (त्रेतायां द्वापरे चैव
कलिजाश् च ससंशयाः 12. 230. 7) as to
what is at the root of a man's success—
his effort, fate, or nature 12. 230. 4; in the
Dvāpara, the earth has to be ploughed and
even then it does not yield much harvest
(कृष्टपच्यैव पृथिवी भवत्य् अल्पफला
तथा) 12. 70. 17; in this Yuga people have to
copulate to beget progeny (द्वापरे मैथुनो
धर्मः प्रजानाम् अभवन् नृप) 12. 200.
37; evil tribes like the Talavaras and the
Andharkas from the south and the Yaunas
(Yavanas) and the Gāndhāras from the
north move on earth from the Tretā onwards
(i. e. also in the Dvāpara) 12. 200. 39-40, 42.
I. Life expectancy: Vyāsa told his son
Śuka that the life expectancy of people dimini-
shes by a quarter in each succeeding Yuga
after the Kṛta, hence in the Dvāpara they
live for two hundred years ( … त्रेतादिष्व्
एतेषां पादशो ह्रसते वयः) 12. 224. 24;
Vyāsa also told Śuka that according to his
information life expectancy of people, along
with other things, gradually decreased in the
successive Yugas ( … अनुयुगं ह्रसन्तीति
च नः श्रुतम्।आयूंषि … ) 12. 224. 25;
this is also what Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira (आयुर् … मनुष्याणाम् अनुयुगं
ह्रसतीति निबोध मे) 3. 188. 13; according
to Saṃjaya, however, the life expectancy of
people in the Dvāpara was two thousand
years (आयुःसंख्या … संक्त्याता … ।द्वि-
सहस्रं द्वापरे तु) 6. 11. 5-6 (ap-
parently Saṃjaya made confusion between
the duration of the Dvāpara age and the
life expectancy of people in that Yuga).
J. Simile: The place where the river
Narmadā passes along the Vaiḍūrya moun-
tain is compared to the junction of the Tretā
(f.) and the Dvāpara (m.) 3. 121. 18-19.
K. Name of Sūrya: Dvāpara appears as
48th name among the hundred and eight
names of Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to
Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words कृत, त्रेता,
द्वापर and कलि occurring in 5. 140. 7-15
are wrongly interpreted by Nīlakaṇṭha (Bom.
Ed. 5. 142. 7-15) as names of the four Yugas,
and not as the names of the throws in the
game of dice].

धनिष्ठा
Dhaniṣṭhā f. (sg., pl.): Name of a
नक्षत्र।
A. Computation of time began with it:
When the Abhijit नक्षत्र dropped down from
the sky and Indra was confused in calculating
time, Brahman ordained that time (काल =
युग) began with Dhaniṣṭhā, whereas for-
merly it began with Rohiṇī (धनिष्ठादिस्
तदा कालो ब्रह्मणा परिनिर्मितः।रोहिण्या-
द्यो ऽभवत् पूर्वम्) 3. 219. 10 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 230. 10: यस्य नक्षत्रस्या-
द्यक्षणे चन्द्रसूर्यगुरूणां योगस् तद्
युगादिनक्षत्रम्।तच् च पूर्वं रोहिण्य्
अभूत्।तदा ऽभिजित्पतनकाले तु एकन्यूनैर्
अहोरात्रैर् भगणस्य भोगात् कृतयुगादि-
नक्षत्रं धनिष्ठैवाभद् इत्य् अर्थः).
B. Religious rites: (1) Nārada told Devakī
(13. 63. 2-4) that if one, with composed
mind, gave a cart, yoked with bulls and filled
with garments and food (?) under the con-
stellation Dhaniṣṭhā he, in the next life,
instantly attained kingdom (गोप्रयुक्तं
धनिष्ठासु यानं दत्त्वा समाहितः।
वस्त्ररश्मिधरं सद्यः प्रेत्य राज्यम्
प्रपद्यते) 13. 63. 29; (2) Yama told
Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that if one offered a
काम्य श्राद्ध under the Dhaniṣṭhā (धनि-
ष्थायाम्) he obtained a share in kingdom
and did not meet with difficulties 13. 89. 12.

धर्मयुग
Dharmayuga: See Kṛtayuga.

धूमकेतु
Dhūmaketu m.: A comet; or planet
Rāhu (?); according to Nī., name of a sub-
ordinate planet (उपग्रह).
Among the bad omens which betokened
the annihilation of the Kauravas, and which
were pointed out by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
one was related to a very fierce comet taking
hold of the Puṣya constellation (अभावं
हि विशेषेष्ण कुरूणां प्रतिपश्यति।धूम-
केतुर् महाघोरः पुष्यम् आक्रम्य
तिष्ठति॥) 6. 3. 12; (महाघोर धूम-
केतु may stand for Rāhu, cf. 6. 3. 26
where a तीव्रग्रह which very probably
means Rāhu, is compared to धूमकेतु; ac-
cording to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 13 Dhūma-
ketu is a particular उपग्रह (उपग्रह-
विशेषः); he looks upon both Rāhu and Ketu
as subordinate planets, cf. his Comm. on Bom.
Ed. 6. 17. 2). [See Rāhu]

ध्रुव
Dhruva1 m.: Name of the polar star.
A. Described as the best among the
heavenly bodies (ज्योतिषां श्रेष्ठम्) 12.
326. 53; identified as the son of king Uttāna-
pāda (औत्तानपाद) 13. 3. 15.
B. Bad
omen: Among the bad omens reported by
Vyāsa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra one was related to the
blazing Dhruva's movement towards left
which foretold terrible happenings (ध्रुवः
प्रज्वलितो घोरम् अपसव्यं प्रवर्तते)
6. 3. 16.
C. Relation with Nārāyaṇa:
Bhagavān (Nārāyaṇa) pointed out to Nārada
that Dhruva, the best among the luminous
heavenly bodies moving in the sky, was
within him (ध्रुवं च ज्योतिषां श्रेष्ठं
पश्य नारद खेचरं (मत्स्थं) 12.
326. 53.
D. Relation with the star
Viśvāmitra: Viśvāmitra, stationed between
Dhruva Auttānapāda and the Brahmarṣis
(the seven stars forming the constellation
Ursa Major), shines constantly in the north
(ध्रुवस्यौत्तानपादस्य ब्रह्मर्षीणां
तथैव च।मध्ये ज्वलति यो नित्यम्
उदीचीम् आश्रितो दिशम्) 13. 3. 15.
E. Neg-
lecting Dhruva harmful: Yājñavalkya told
Janaka that those who fail to see Dhruva,
having seen it once before, have only a year
to live (संवत्सरवियोगस्य संभवेयुः
शरीरिणः॥यो ऽरुन्धतीं न पश्येत
दृष्टपूर्वां कदाचन।तथैव ध्रुवम्
इत्य् आहुः) 12. 305. 8-9.
F. Simile: All
ascetics of the Naranārāyaṇāśrama (12. 126.
2) sat round king Vīradyumna as do the
seven sages round Dhruva 12. 126. 25. [For
Dhruva also see Section 1. 7]

ध्रुव
Dhruva2 nt.: Designation of the four
नक्षत्रस् (Rohiṇī, Pūrvā Phalgunī, Pūrvā
Bhādrapadā and Pūrvāṣāḍhā).
When the Pāṇḍavas decided to get the
wealth of king Marutta Āvikṣita, left on the
mountain Himavant, they ordered their army
to march out on the day (i. e. Sunday ?, see the
next) which was presided over by the Dhruva
नक्षत्र (कृत्वा तु पाण्डवाः सर्वे रत्ना-
हरणनिश्चयम्।सेनाम् आज्ञापयाम् आसुर्
नक्षत्रे ऽहनि च ध्रुवे) 14. 62. 17 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 14. 63. 18: ध्रुवे नक्षत्रे
रोहिण्याम् उत्तरात्रये च). [See Dhruva3]

ध्रुव
Dhruva3 nt.: Designation of the day
presided over by Dhruva (? i. e. Sunday ?).
The Pāṇḍavas ordered their army to
march out on the ध्रुव day (सेनाम् आज्ञा-
पयाम् आसुर् नक्षत्रे ऽहनि च ध्रुवे) 14.
62. 17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 14. 63. 18: अहनि
वारे ध्रुवे रविवारे। But Nī.'s explanation
amounts to anachronism). [See Dhruva2]

पुनर्वसु
Punarvasu m. (sg., du.): Name of a
नक्षत्र।
A. Religious rites: (1) Gifts under
this नक्षत्र: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63.
2-4) that if one gave as gifts cakes
(अपूपान्) and food (अन्नानि) under Punar-
vasu (पुनर्वसौ) one obtained fame and
good look and was born in a family that had
ample food (बह्वन्ने जायते कुले) 13. 63. 9;
(2) श्राद्ध: Yama told Śaśabindu (13.
89. 1) that if one offered a काम्य श्राद्ध
under Punarvasu he reaped (ample) harvest
(कृषिभागी भवेन् मर्त्यः कुर्वञ् श्राद्-
धं पुनर्वसौ) 13. 89. 4.
B. Smile:
The two Pāñcāla warriors (Candradeva and
Daṇḍadhara cf. the various readings under
8. 33. 15) guarding the wheels of Yudhiṣṭhira
shone on his two sides as do the two Punar-
vasu stars seen on the two sides of the moon
(रथाभ्याशे चकासेते चन्द्रस्येव पुनर्-
वसू) 8. 33. 16.

पुष्य
Puṣya1 m.: Name of a नक्षत्र, and
of the moon's conjunction with this नक्षत्र
(Puṣyayoga); also called Tiṣya (3. 188. 87).
A. Description: auspicious (पुण्य-
योग) 3. 261. 15.
B. Considered favour-
able for marching out of the army or for
going out on a pilgrimage: (1) Duryodhana
urged again and again the assembled kings
to march towards Kurukṣetra on that very
day since it was presided over by the Puṣya
नक्षत्र (आज्ञापयच् च राज्ञस् तान् पार्थि-
वान् दुष्टचेतसः।प्रयाध्वं वै कुरु-
क्षेत्रं पुष्यो ऽद्येति पुनः पुनः) 5. 148.
3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 150. 3: पुष्यनक्-
षत्रं हि अश्विन्याः पौरणमास्या उपरि
अष्टम्यां भवति; cf. 5. 140. 18: सप्तमाच्
चापि दिवसाद् अमावास्या भविष्यति); (2)
Kṛṣṇa too, with the Pāṇḍavas, started towards
Kuru (kṣetra) when Rauhiṇeya (Balarāma)
went away on the day which was presided
over by Puṣya (पुष्येण) 9. 34. 14; 9.
34. 9; (3) When the Mārgaśīrṣī (full
moon day of the month Mārgaśīrṣa) had
passed and the Puṣya had set in, the Pāṇḍa-
vas, together with Dhaumya and other
ascetics, started from the Kāmyaka forest
towards the east (3. 91. 28) to visit the तीर्थस्
(मार्गशीर्ष्याम् अतीतायां पुष्येण प्रययुस्
तदा) 3. 91. 25; (4) Balarāma started for
his तीर्थयात्रा under the Puṣya and returned
to Kurukṣetra under the Śravaṇa; he was
out for 42 days (चत्वारिंशद् अहान्य् अद्य
द्वे च मे निःसृतस्य वै।पुष्येण सं-
प्रयातो ऽस्मि श्रवणे पुनर् आगतः) 9 33.
5 (see Editor's note on the stanza, Cr. Ed.
Vol. 11, p. 489); 9. 34. 14; (5) Drupada
asked his Purohita, whom he sent as his mes-
senger to the Kauravas, to start when the
moon was in conjunction with the Puṣya so
that he might achieve the objective of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira (स भवान् पुष्ययोगेन … कौरवेयान्
प्रयात्व् आशु कौन्तेयस्यार्थसिद्धये) 5.
6. 17; (6) Daśaratha asked his Purohita
to make the necessary preparations in connec-
tion with the consecration of Rāma as hair-
apparent since on that night Puṣya was to
enter into the auspicious conjunction (with the
moon) (अद्य पुष्यो निशि ब्रह्मन् पुण्यं
योगम् उपैष्यति) 3. 261. 15.
C. Advent
of the Kṛta Yuga: When the moon, the sun,
the Tiṣya and the Bṛhaspati will come in
one राशि, the Kṛta Yuga will commence
(यदा चन्द्रश् च सूर्यश् च तथा तिष्य-
बृहस्पती।एकराशौ समेष्यन्ति प्रपत्-
स्यति तदा कृतम्॥) 3. 188. 87 (Nī., how-
ever, on Bom. Ed. 3. 190. 90: गुरुसूर्य-
चन्द्राः यदा युगपत् पुष्यनक्षत्रम्
एष्यन्ति तदा कृतयुगप्रवृत्तिर् इत्य् अर्थः).
D. Religious rites: (1) Gifts under this
नक्षत्र: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4)
that by giving gold, whether wrought or
unwrought, as gift under Puṣya (पुष्ये)
one shone like Soma (i. e. moon ?) in the
worlds which have no (other) light (अनालो-
केषु लोकेषु सोमवत् स विराजते) 13. 63. 10
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 64. 10: अनालोकेषु
आलोकान्तरवर्जितेषु स्वयंप्रकाशेष्व् इत्य्
अर्थः); (2) श्राद्ध: Yama told Śaśabindu
(13. 89. 1) that one who desired prosperity
should think of offering a काम्य श्राद्ध
under the Puṣya नक्षत्र (पुष्टिकामो ऽथ
पुष्येण श्राद्धम् ईहेत मानवः) 13. 89.
4.
E. Bad omen: Among the bad omens
for the Kauravas, pointed out by Vyāsa to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, one was related to a fierce comet
(Rāhu ?) that had taken hold of Puṣya
(धूमकेतुर् महाघोरः पुष्यम् आक्रम्य
तिष्ठति) 6. 3. 12. [See Dhūmaketu, Pauṣya]

पुष्य
Puṣya2 m.: See Kaliyuga.

पूर्वा
Pūrvā Proṣṭhapadā f.: See Pūrvā
Bhādrapadā.

पूर्वा
Pūrvā Phalgunī f. (du., pl.): Name of
a double नक्षत्र distinguished as Pūrvā
and Uttarā. [Referred to also simply as
Phalgunī 13. 89. 6].
A. Epic event: Arjuna was born on
mountain Himavant under the junction of
the two constellations Pūrvā Phalgunī and
Uttarā Phalgunī and hence he was called
Phalguna (उत्तराभ्यां च पूर्वाभ्यां
फल्गुनीभ्याम् अहं दिवा।जातो … तेन
मां फल्गुनं विदुः) 4. 39. 14 (Nī., who
reads (Bom. Ed. 4. 44. 16) उत्तराभ्यां
फलगुनीभ्यां नक्षत्राभ्याम् explains it
as नक्षत्राभ्यां ताराभ्यां तत्र स्थिते
चन्द्रे इत्य् अर्थः).
B. Religious rites:
(1) दान: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4)
that if one, after observing fast, gave to Brāh-
maṇas under Pūrvā Phalgunī (फल्गुनी-
पूर्वसमये) food mixed with condensed
sugar cane juice (भक्षान् फाणितसंयुक्-
तान्), one obtained prosperity (सौभाग्यम्
ऋच्छति) 13. 63. 13; (2) श्राद्ध: Yama
told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that if one offered
a काम्य श्राद्ध under (Pūrvā) Phalgunī
one became prosperous (फल्गुनीषु ददच्
छ्राद्धं सुभगः श्राद्धदो भवेत्) 13.
89. 6.

पूर्वा
Pūrvā Bhādrapadā f.; also called
Pūrvā Proṣṭhapadā (du., pl.); Pūrva Pro-
ṣṭhapada m. (sg.) (6. 3. 14): Name of a
double नक्षत्र distinguished as Pūrvā and
Uttarā.
A. Religious rites: (1) दान: Nārada
told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that by offering the
राजमाषस् (kind of beans) as a gift under
the Pūrvabhādrapadā conjunction one enjoys
all kinds of food and becomes happy in next
life (पूर्वभाद्रपदायोगे राजमाषान् प्र-
दाय तु।सर्वभक्षफलोपेतः स वै
प्रेत्य सुखी भवेत्॥) 13. 63. 31; (2)
श्राद्ध: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1)
that by offering a काम्य श्राद्ध under
Pūrvaproṣṭhapadā one obtained many goats
and sheep (पूर्वप्रोष्ठपदाः कुर्वन् बहु
विन्देद् अजाविकम्) 13. 89. 13; but in general
one is not supposed to offer any rites to
gods and manes under the two Proṣṭhapadā
नक्षत्रस् (दैवं पित्र्यम् अथापि च। …
न प्रोष्ठपदयोः कार्यम्) 13. 107. 119.
B. Bad effect: Śukra, when in conjunction
with the two Proṣṭhapadās has always wealth,
so also the Lord of riches (i. e. Kubera);
Śukra (when in conjunction with the two
नक्षत्रस्) takes away from men what-
ever wealth they had earned as desired
(नित्यं प्रोष्ठपदाभ्यां च शुक्रे
धनपतौ तथा।मनुष्येभ्यः समा-
दत्ते शुक्रश् चित्तार्जितं धनम्॥) 5. 112.
3 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 5. 114. 3:
प्रोष्ठपदाभ्याम् इति तृतीया … सप्तम्यर्थे
तेन तस्मिन् नक्षत्रद्वये शुक्रे शुक्रवा-
सरे तद्योगे सति शुक्रो ऽग्निः धनपतौ
कुबेरस्य वृद्ध्यर्थं मनुष्येभ्यः
संप्रदानेभ्यः धनं दत्ते ददाति।
शुक्रश् चित्तार्जितम् इत्य् अनेन वह्निरेतस्-
त्वं तस्य प्रदर्श्यते।धनार्थी उक्तन-
क्षत्रवारयोगे वह्निं प्रार्थयेत्।तच् च
धनं यागादिद्वारा वा भूमौ निखनेन
वा सर्वं कुबेरं प्रत्य् एव गच्छतीति
भावः).
C. Bad omen: Among the
bad omens pointed out by Vyāsa to Dhṛtarā-
ṣṭra one referred to Śukra's having ascended
the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada constellation and then
having gone over to the Uttara Proṣṭhapada,
was still looking at it (i. e. looking at the
Pūrva Proṣṭhapada) 6. 3. 14 (for the citation
and Nī.'s commentary on it see above
Uttarā Bhādrapadā p. 232. 2). [See Uttarā
Bhādrapadā]

पूर्वाषाढा
Pūrvāṣāḍhā f. (pl.): Name of a double
नक्षत्र distinguished as Pūrvā and Uttarā.
Religious rites: (1) दान: Nārada
told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that if one, after
observing fast, gave as a gift under the
Pūrvāṣāḍhā (पूर्वास्व् अषाढासु) pots full
of curds (दधिपात्राणि) to a Brāhmaṇa
born in good family and of good conduct and
who was proficient in the Vedas, the giver,
after death, was born in a family that was
rich in cows 13. 63. 25; (2) श्राद्ध: Yama
told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering a
काम्य श्राद्ध under the Pūrvāṣāḍhā (the
word पूर्वा does not occur but is easily
inferred) one obtained excellent fame (यशो
ऽषाढास्व् अनुत्तमम्) 13. 89. 10.

पौष
Pauṣa m.: Name of a month
Aṅgiras had told Bhīṣma that if one
spent the month of Pauṣa eating only once a
day (भक्तेनैकेन यः क्षपेत्) he was born
fortunate, handsome and famous 13. 109. 19.

पौष्य

vaṇa (वक्रानुवक्रं कृत्वा च श्रवणे
पावकप्रभः।ब्रह्मराशिं समावृत्य
लोहिताङ्गो व्यवस्थितः॥ 6. 3. 17) (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 18: तत्रैव सर्वतोभद्र-
चक्रे मघास्थो लोहिताङ्गो ऽङ्गारको वक्रा-
नुवक्रं कृत्वा पुनःपुनर् वक्रीभूय
ब्रह्मणा बृहस्पतिनाक्रान्तं राशिं

A day and night each of Brahman is
equal to one thousand Yugas (a Yuga or a

अहर् यद् ब्रह्मणो विदुः।रात्रिं युगस-
हस्रान्तां ते ऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः॥) 6. 30.
17 = 12. 224. 30; at the beginning of his
night, i. e. during the Pralaya, Brahman
enters into himself and sleeps; at the end of
the night he is awakened from his sleep and
creates the great भूत (i. e. Hiraṇya-
garbha) (रात्रिस् तावत्तिथी ब्राह्मी तदादौ
विश्वम् ईश्वरः।प्रलये ऽध्यात्मम् आविश्य

(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 302. 14: तद् एव
चतुर्युगं दशशतावृत्तं कल्पं तद् एव
च ब्राह्मम् अहर् उच्यते); at the end of
Brahman's night there arises due to the
kindness of the god of boundless lustre
(i. e. of god Nārāyaṇa 12. 328. 12) a lotus,
where again by the god's kindness Brahman
is born; at the end of Brahman's day,
from the forehead of the god, who is angry,
arises his son, Rudra, the destroyer (ब्राह्मे
रात्रिक्षये प्राप्ते तस्य ह्य् अमिततेजसः।
प्रसादात् प्रादुरभवत् पद्मं पद्म-
निभेक्षण।तत्र ब्रह्मा समभवत् स
तस्यैव प्रसादतः॥अह्नः क्षये ललाटाच्
च सुतो देवस्य वै तथा।क्रोधाविष्टस्य
संजज्ञे रुद्रः संहारकारकः) 12. 328.
15-16; at the beginning of the Brahman's
day all manifestations arise from the non-
manifest; at the beginning of his night the
manifestations are dissolved into the same
non-manifest (अव्यक्ताद् व्यक्तयः सर्वाः
प्रभवन्त्य् अहरागमे।रात्र्यागमे प्र-
लीयन्ते तत्रैवाव्यक्तसंज्ञके) 6. 30. 18.

the sky in the company of Keśava (भूमाव्
आसीन एकाग्रो जगाम मनसा भवम्॥
ततः प्रणिहिते ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते शुभलक्-
षणे।आत्मानम् अर्जुनो ऽपश्यद् गगने
सहकेश्वम्॥) 7. 57. 19-20 (Nī. who
reads प्रणिहितो (Bom. Ed. 7. 80. 23) explains
समाहितमनाः).
B. Time for perfor-
ming the संध्या ceremony: Bhīṣma
advised Yudhiṣṭhira that one who wanted
long life should wake up at the ब्राह्म

for purification, should, with folded hands,
perform the first संध्या (ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते

हं स्थापयित्वाग्रे नक्षत्रे भगदैवते)
1. 8. 13 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 8. 16:
भगदैवते पूर्वयोः फल्गुन्योर् इति
लौकिकाः।फल्गुनीनक्षत्रम् अर्यमा
देवता फल्गुनीनक्षत्रं भगो देवतेति
श्रुतेर् उत्तराफल्गुन्योर् वा विवाहं स्था-
पयित्वा निश्चित्य।).
B. Bad omen: Among
the bad omens noticed by Vyāsa there was
one according to which the planet Śanaiścara
was afflicting the Bhāgya (i. e. the Uttarā
Phalgunī) नक्षत्र (भाग्यं नक्षत्रम्
आक्रम्य सूर्यपुत्रेण पीड्यते) 6. 3. 14

202. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 210. 2: मघासु
गमनार्थं निषिद्धे ऽपि नक्षत्रे असुर-
त्वाद् ययतुः).
B. Importance: A cer-
tain तीर्थ named jointly after the Kṛttikā

tained the merit of performing the Agniṣṭoma
and the Atirātra sacrifices (कृत्तिकामघयोश्
चैव तीर्थम्) 3. 82. 46.
C. Omens:
(1) Vyāsa told Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the start of
the war that a calamity was predicted for the

Kauravas gathered for war at Kurukṣetra on
the day when the moon entered the Maghā
and the seven principal planets, shining, came
together in the sky (मघाविषयगः सोमस्
तद् दिनं प्रत्यपद्यत।दीप्यमानाश् च
संपेतुर् दिवि सप्त महाग्रहाः॥) 6. 17. 2
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 17. 2 has a long com-
mentary trying to reconcile the astronomical
statements. He does not interpret मघा-
विषय as the region of the constellation
Maghā but as पितृदेश: मघा पित्रयं नक्-
षत्रं तस्य विषयो देशः पितृलोकस् तद्गतः
सोमः। … एतेन युद्धारंभं प्रकृत्य
‘मघाविषयगः सोमस् तद् दिनं प्रत्य-
पद्यत’ इति भीष्मपर्वणि सञ्जयवाक्यान्
मघायां युद्धारंभ इत्य् अपि निरस्तम्।
 … महाग्रहाः राहुकेत्वोर् उपग्रहत्वात्
सप्तैव).
D. Religious rites: (1) दान:
Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that by
offering plates (? rather ‘heaps’) full of
sesame one had many sons and cattle in this
life and enjoyed life after death (मघासु
तिलपूर्णानि वर्धमानानि मानवः।प्र-
दाय पुत्रपशुमान् इह प्रेत्य च मोदते)
13. 63. 12; (2) श्राद्ध: Yama told
Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering a
काम्य श्राद्ध under the Maghā (मघासु)
one became eminent among kinsmen 13. 89.
5; (3) Bhīṣma recited for Yuḍhiṣṭhira the
गाथास् sung by the manes which were
recited for him formerly by the venerable
Sanatkumāra; according to these गाथास् the
manes cherished a wish that some one would
be born in their line who would offer to them
on the thirteenth day under the Maghā, during
the Dakṣiṇāyana, rice boiled in milk, together
with clarified butter or meat of red goat,
that was fanned, according to the rites, by
the (elephant's) ear, under the shadow of
an elephant (गाथाश् चाप्य् अत्र गायन्ति
पितृगीता युधिष्ठिर।सनत्कुमारो भग-
वान् पुरा मय्य् अभ्यभाषत॥अपि
नः स कुले जायाद् यो नो दद्यात् त्रयो-
दशीम्।मघासु सर्पिषा युक्तं पायसं
दक्षिणायने॥आजेन वापि लौहेन मघास्व्
एव यतव्रतः।हस्तिच्छायासु विधिवत्
कर्णव्यजनवीजितम्॥) 13. 88. 11-13. (In-
terpretation of हस्तिच्छाया as an eclipse in
this context is not favoured by the commen-
tators on the Manusmṛti; on Manu 3. 274,
which has the reading प्राक्छाये कुञ्जरस्य
च, Kullūka observes: हस्तिनः पूर्वां
दिशं गतायां छायायाम् … न तु त्रयो-
दशीहस्तिच्छाययोः समुच्चयः।; Medhātithi
on the same stanza: तथा कुञ्जरस्य
हस्तिनः प्राक्छाये प्राच्यां दिशि गतायां
छायायाम् अपराण्हेतरे काल इत्य् अर्थः। …
यत् तु व्याचक्षते राहूपरागो हस्तिच्छायो-
च्यते … तद् अयुक्तम्।; Rāghavānanda:
कुञ्जरस्यैव छाया विवक्षिता न तु योग-
विशेषः।कर्णव्यजनवीजितम् इति वाक्यान्-
तराच् चेति which latter is an obvious reference
to the Mbh. passage).

153. 28.
B. Epic Event: Bhīṣma, lying

he guessed that it must be the eighth day
of the bright fortnight of that month (त्रि-
भागशेषः पक्षो ऽयं शुक्लो भवितुम्

Religious rites: (1) Vedic: Aśvamedha:
when the return of the horse, wandering on
the earth, was reported to Yudhiṣṭhira, he,
noticing that the day was the twelfth of the
(bright) fortnight of the month of Māgha
and that the constellation (viz. Puṣya) was
favourable, he asked Bhīma to make prepa-
rations for the horse sacrifice (एतस्मिन्न् एव
काले तु द्वादशीं माघपाक्षिकीम्।इष्टम्
गृहीत्वा नक्षत्रं) 14. 86. 4 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 14. 85. 4: इष्टं नक्षत्रं पुष्यम्);
(2) Non-Vedic: (a) स्नान: Aṅgiras told

mind and had strictly observed the vows
bathed at Prayāga in Māgha he was puri-
fied of the sins and went to heaven 13. 26. 36;
(b) दान: One who offered sesame to Brāh-
maṇas in Māgha did not go to hell 13. 65. 7;

taking food only once a day he becomes
eminent in his illustrious family and among
his kinsmen (श्रीमत्कुले ज्ञातिमध्ये स
महत्त्वं प्रपद्यते) 13. 109. 20.
D.
Smile: Bhīṣma said that the arrows which
pierced his vitals, as (the winter time
शैशिरः कालः 6. 113. 7) in the month of
Māgha pierced the vitals of cows, were those
of Arjuna and not of Śikhaṇḍin (कृन्तन्ति
मम गात्राणि माघमासे गवाम् इव।
अर्जुनस्य इमे बाणा नेमे बाणाः शिखण्डि-
नः) 6. 114. 60 (see the Editor's note on the
stanza, Cr. Ed. Vol. 7, p. 795; for the reading

14. 86. 8; (2) for non-Vedic rites: (a)
The sages, Aṅgiras and others, while on a
तीर्थयात्रा, went to the holy river Kauśikī
on the Māghī (माघ्याम्) 13. 96. 6 (for the
river Kauśiki see the Editor's note on 13.
3. 10, Cr. Ed. Vol. 17, part II, p. 1054);
(b) On every Māghī (as well as on the
Āṣāḍhi) Virūpākṣa, the king of the Rākṣasas
used to give excellent and well-garnished
food, as desired, to the Brāhmaṇas (तस्य
(i. e. of Virūpākṣa) नित्यं तथाषाष्ह्यां

प्रययुस् ततः) 3. 91. 25.
B. Proper
time for army manoeuvre: Marching out of
the army for attack on the full moon day
of the month of Caitra or of Mārgaśīrṣa is
recommended since the crops the are ripe
and water is ample; it is then also neither

13. 63. 24; (2) श्राद्ध: Yama told
Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering a

from the world of mortals (गच्छन्ति मानु-
षाल् लोकात् स्वर्गलोकम् अनुत्तमम्) 13.
63. 7 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 64. 7: सौम्य-
नक्षत्रे मृगशिरसि); (2) श्राद्ध: Yama
told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that one desirous

मृगोत्तमे मृगशिरसि, cf. Editor's note on
the stanza Cr. Ed. Vol. 17, p. 1090).

Simile: Rāma ran after the deer as did
Rudra after the Tārāmṛga (अन्वधावन्
मृगं रामो रुद्रस् तारामृगं यथा)
3. 262. 19 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 278. 20:

वत्यां महायशाः।मैत्रे नक्षत्रयोगे
स्म … ॥) 9. 34. 12 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
9. 35. 14 मैत्रनक्षत्रयोगे अनुराधायाम्;
see Puṣya1 B (4) above p. 256; however,
see the Editor's note on this stanza: “There
is no real inconsistency between this passage
on the one hand and 9. 33. 5 and 9. 34. 14
on the other. The latter evidently refer to
the Nakṣatra (that is, Puṣya) occupied by
the moon, while मैत्रे नक्षत्रयोगे refers
to the sun's conjunction with the Nakṣatra
Maitra (= Anurādhā)” Cr. Ed. Vol. 11,
p. 489). [See Anurādhā]

मैत्र
Maitra2 m.: Name of a मुहूर्त।
On the day when Kṛṣṇa wanted to go to
Hāstinapura he woke up and finished his early
morning rites when sun rose and the Maitra
Muhūrta had set in (सूर्ये विमल उद्गते।
मैत्रे मुहूर्ते संप्राप्ते। … कृत्वा पौर्-
वाण्हिकं कृत्यम्) 5. 81. 6, 9 (Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 5. 83. 6: मैत्रे जन्मर्क्षाद्
अष्टमतारायाम् दूतस्य हि स्वामिबलेनैव
बलवत्त्वम् इत्य् अर्थः).

यमस्य
Yamasya Putraḥ m.: Name of a planet
(Ketu ?).
When Karṇa fell, the rivers stood still,
the sun, with a turbid hue set, and the planet,
the son of Yama, having the colour of blazing
sun arose obliquely (ग्रहश् च तिर्यग् ज्वलि-
तार्कवर्णो यमस्य पुत्रो ऽभ्युदियाय
राजन्) 8. 68. 47 (one Telugu (T2) ms.
actually reads केतुः for राजन्; most Bengali
mss., few Devanāgarī and one Grantha read
सोमस्य पुत्रो i. e. Budha).

राका
Rākā f.: Name of the second Paurṇa-
māsī when the full moon day extends to two
days (cf. या पूर्वा पौर्णमासी सानुमतिर्
योत्तरा सा राका Ait. Br. 32. 9; Nir. 11. 29).
A. Description: Observing her vows
strictly (सुव्रता) 8. 24. 74.
B. Mytholo-
gical events: (1) Rākā, personified, along with
Anumatī and many others arrived at the

of the horses of Śiva's chariot when it was
made ready for Śiva's fight with the Tripuras
(कुहूं राकां च सुव्रताम्।योक्त्राणि
चक्रुर् वाहानाम्) 8. 24. 74.

राहु
Rāhu m.: Name of a planet, also called
Svarbhānu (6. 13. 39-40; 13. 17. 37).
A. Description: Described as round
(परिमण्डल) 6. 13. 40; fierce (तीव्र)
6. 3. 26; dark (श्याम) 6. 3. 15; blazing,
(प्रज्वलित) 6. 3. 15; having smoke and fire
सधूमः सहपावकः) 6. 3. 15; having
copper-red crest (? ताम्र° °शिख) 6. 3. 24.
B. Importance: Chief among the planets
(ग्रहपतिर् वरः) 13. 17. 37; Rāhu, along
with other planets, visits the सभा of Brah-
man 2. 11. 20, 19; Rāhu, not directly named
but probably referred to as Grahapati, finds
place in the list of a thousand names of
Śiva (केतुग्रहो ग्रहपतिर् वरः) 13. 17.
37 (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 17. 38,
interprets ग्रहः as राहुः: केतुश् च प्रसिद्-
धः।चन्द्राक्रौ गृह्णातीति ग्रहो राहुः।
ग्रहाणां पतिः [ग्रहपतिः] क्रूरत्वात्
मंगलः); Rāhu finds place also in the
Daivatavaṃśa 13. 151. 12.
C. Measure-
ment: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to tell
him complete extent (सर्वं (प्रमाणं))
of Rāhu, to which Saṃjaya agreed 6. 12.
3-4; according to the information of Saṃ-
jaya his diameter (विष्कम्भ) was 12000
योजनस्, and his circumference (परिणाह)
36000 योजनस्; according to the learned
Paurāṇikas his expanse (? विपुलत्व) was
6000 योजनस् (परिमण्डलो महाराज स्वर्-
भानुः श्रूयते ग्रहः।योजनानां सह-
स्राणि विष्कम्भो द्वादशास्य वै॥परिणा-
हेन षट्त्रिंशद् विपुलत्वेन चानघ।
षष्टिम् आहुः शतान्य् अस्य बुधाः पौरा-
णिकास् तथा) 6. 13. 40-41 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets विपुलत्वेन as
ततो ऽप्य् आधिक्येन, इदम् उत्तरान्वयि; in
that case the circumference of Rāhu will be
36000 + 6000 = 42000 योजनस्; see also
Editor's note on the stanza, Cr. Ed. Vol. 7,
p. 765: “Saṃjaya is here relying upon his
studies, and not upon the Eye Divine”);
owing to its being larger in size than the sun
and the moon, Rāhu covers them both at
proper times (स राहुश् छादयत्य् एतौ
(i. e. चन्द्रादित्यौ) यथाकालं महत्तया)
6. 13. 45.
D. Omens: (1) Among the
bad omens for the Kurus reported by Vyāsa
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra one was related to Rāhu's
swallowing the sun 6. 3. 11; this event is
again referred to by Vyāsa as occurring
at an improper time, i. e. on the thirteenth
day of the month and in which Rāhu swa-
llowed both Candra and Sūrya together;
this meant destruction of the subjects 6. 3.
28-29 (for citation and Nī.'s commentary
see Sūrya below); also cf. 14. 76. 15; 2. 71.
26; 9. 55. 10; the same was also noted by
Karṇa and reported to Kṛṣṇa (राहुर् अर्कम्
उपैष्यति) 5. 141. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 143.
11: अयं कर्तरीयोगः सोमवंश्यानां
सूर्यवंश्यानां च राज्ञां क्षयकर
इत्य् अर्थः); (reference to Rāhu implied in
6. 73. 10: प्रजासंहरणे सूर्यः क्रूरैर्
इव महाग्रहैः (परिवृतः); (2) Among
the omens noticed by Vyāsa there was also
another according to which a black planet
(= Rāhu) blazing, and full of smoke and
fire had gone over to Jyeṣṭhā and remained
there (श्यामो ग्रहः प्रज्वलितः सधू-
मः सहपावकः। … ज्येष्ठाम् आक्रम्य
तिष्ठति॥)) 6. 3. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3.
16 reads श्वेतो ग्रहः in place of श्यामो
ग्रहः and explains it as Ketu: श्वेतो द्वितीय
उपग्रहः केतुसंज्ञः); (3) Vyāsa
had also noticed that the two Grahas
(Rāhu and Ketu ?) having copper-red and
ruddy crests (respy. ?) appear blazing in the
sky and cover up the lustre of the seven
sages (i. e. the constellation Ursa Major)
(ग्रहौ ताम्रारुणशिखौ प्रज्वलन्ताव् इव
स्थितौ।सप्तर् षीणाम् उदाराणां समवच्-
छाद्य वै प्रभाम्॥) 6. 3. 24; (4)
Kṛṣṇa observed that the अमावास्या had
already set in on the thirteenth day of the
dark half of the month and that Rāhu had
turned the fourteenth day into the fifteenth
(which was looked upon as bad); he told the
Yādavas that such an event had happened
only once before at the time of the Bhārata
war (a reference to 6. 3. 28-29 above) and
that it had now occurred again to foretell
the destruction of the Yādavas (त्रयो-
दश्याम् अमावास्या तान् दृष्ट्वा प्राब्रवीद्
इदम्॥चतुर्दशी पञ्चदशी कृतेयं राहुणा
पुनः।तदा च भारते युद्धे प्राप्ता
चाद्य क्षयाय नः॥) 16. 3. 16-17 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 16. 2. 19, notices a hint of a solar
eclipse in this statement: एवं सत्य् अग्रिम-
पक्षे वृद्ध्या भाव्यं तन् न जातं
प्रत्य् उत एका तिथिः क्षीणा तत्र ग्रहणं
च जातम्). [See Dhūmaketu; for Rāhu,
also see Section 1. 7]

रेवती
Revatī f.: Name of a constellation.
A. Placement in the Śākadvīpa: In
the Śākadvīpa, the constellation Revatī has
been permanently stationed in the sky by an
arrangement made by Pitāmaha (Brahman)
(रेवती दिवि नक्षत्रम् (नित्यं) पितामह-
कृतो विधिः॥) 6. 12. 16 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
6. 11. 18: रेवती ज्योतिर्मण्डलरूपेण दिवि
विभ्रम्यमाणापि दिव्येन रूपेण अत्रापि
वर्तते एवं विधिर् मर्यादा पितामहेन
कृता).
B. Auspicious constellation: Kṛṣṇa
started for Hāstinapura on his peace mission
under the constellation Revatī (रेवत्याम्)
5. 81. 7.
C. Religious rites: (1) दान:
Nārada told Devaki (13. 63. 2-4) that if
one gave as a gift a milch cow together with
a milk-pail made of white copper under
Revatī, the cow waited upon the giver in his
next life and fulfilled his wishes (कांस्यो-
पदोहनां धेनुं रेवत्यां यो प्रयच्-
छति।सा प्रेत्य कामान् आदाय दातारम् उप-
तिष्ठति) 13. 63. 33; (2) श्राद्ध: Yama
told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by offering
a काम्य श्राद्ध under the Revatī one
obtained wealth consisting of much silver
(बहुरूप्यकृतं वित्तं विन्दते रेवतीं
श्रितः) 13. 89. 14 (For Revatī also see
Section 1. 7).

रोहिणी
Rohiṇī f. (sg., once pl. 12. 160. 80):
Name of a constellation.
A. Computation of time: Abhijit, youn-
ger sister of Rohiṇī, vying with her and
desiring for a higher rank went to forest to
practise austerities; Indra was then confused
in calculating time (due to the loss of
a नक्षत्र) 3. 219. 8-9; hence Brahman
ordained that time (काल) would commence
with Dhaniṣṭhā, while formerly it commenced
with Rchiṇī; this made good the loss of one
नक्षत्र (रोहिण्याद्यो ऽभवत् पूर्वम् एवं
संख्या समाभवत्) 3. 219. 10 (for full
citation and Nī.'s commentary see Abhijit and
Dhaniṣṭhā).
B. Auspicious constellation:
The Pāṇḍavas left for Vāraṇāvata on the
eighth day of Phalguna and under the con-
stellation Rohiṇī (रोहिण्याम्) 1. 133. 30.
C. Religious rites: (1) दान: Nārada
told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that in order to
be free from debt (to the manes ?) one
should, under the constellation Rohiṇī, feed
the Brāhmaṇas with known kinds of meat,
beans, cooked rice and clarified butter, and
give them milk at the end of the meal
(रोहिण्यां प्रथितैर् मांसैर् माषैर्
अन्नेन सर्पिषा।पयो ऽनुपानं दातव्यम्
आनृण्याय द्विजातये॥ 13. 63. 6 (Nī. who
reads प्रसृतैर् मार्गैर् मांसैर् explains
मार्गैर् as मृगसंबन्धिभिः); (2)
श्राद्ध: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1)
that one desirous of offspring should offer a
श्राद्ध under Rohiṇī (रोहिण्याम्) 13. 89.
3.
D. Rohiṇī and the असि: The sword
which was created by Brahman as a weapon
(12. 160. 42) had the Rohiṇī stars for their
गोत्र (रोहिण्यो गोत्रम् अस्य (असेः)) 12.
160. 80.
E. Omens: (1) Among the
omens noticed by Vyāsa before the start of
the war there was one according to which
Śanaiścara was afflicting Rohiṇī (रोहिणीं
पीडयन्न् एष स्थितो राजञ् शनैश्चरः) 6.
2. 32 (also cf. the next section F (3); also 5.
141. 7 ? see Prājāpatya2) (2) At the time
of Karṇa's death, Bṛhaspati was afflicting
Rohiṇī (बृहस्पती रोहिणीं संप्रपीड्य)
8. 68. 49.
F. Similes: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira
saw Gāndhārī surrounded by her daughters-
in-law as is Rohiṇī by the stars (ताराभिर् इव
रोहिणीम्) 2. 52. 27; (2) Lopāmudrā, sur-
rounded by her hundred दासीस् and a hundred
maidens, sat like Rohiṇī in the sky (रोहिणीव
दिवि प्रभो) 3. 94. 24; (3) Rāvaṇa draw-
ing near Sītā looked like the planet Śanaiś-
cara when it approached Rohiṇī (ददृशे
रोहिणीम् एत्य शनैश्चर इव ग्रहः) 3.
265. 6; (4) Śāntā waited on Ṛśyaśṛnga
like Rohiṇī on Soma (रोहिणी सोमम् इवानु-
कूला) 3. 113. 22; (5) Sudeva wondered
when would Damayanti be united with Nala
and reach the end of her hardship as Rohiṇī
on meeting the moon (रोहिणी शशिनो यथा)
3. 65. 21. [See Prājāpatya2; for Rohiṇī
also see Section 1. 7]

रौद्र
Raudra m.: Name of a मुथूर्त।
Relationship with events: (1) Epic:
(a) Arjuna warned Bhīma during his noctu-
ral fight with Hiḍimba that with the advent
of the Raudra मुहूर्त the Rākṣasas grew
stronger (रौद्रे मुहूर्ते रक्षांसि प्रब-
लानि भवन्ति च) 1. 142. 22; (b) On the
fourteenth day of the war Arjuna appeared on
the scene under the Raudra मुहूर्त when
the two armies were about to clash (रौद्रे
मुहूर्ते संप्राप्ते सव्यसाची व्यदृश्यत)
7. 64. 3; (रौद्र मुहूर्त very probably
‘terrible hour’ 8. 68. 35); (2) Mytho-
logical: During his conversation with Deva-
senā, Indra observed that the Raudra मुहूर्त
had commenced on a new-moon day (अमा-
वास्यां संप्रवृत्तं मुहूर्तं रौद्रम्
एव च) 3. 213. 27; (धर्मगतं रौद्रम् ?
3. 213. 30).

वसिष्ठ
Vasiṣṭha m.: Name of one of the seven
stars of the constellation Ursa Major.
Among the bad omens noticed by Vyāsa
before the war there was one according
to which the star Arundhatī shone more
brightly than the star Vasiṣṭha (अरुन्धती
तयाप्य् एष वसिष्ठः पृष्ठतः कृतः) 6. 2.
31 (see Editor's note on the stanza, Cr.

दैवते) 1. 213. 78; (2) Mythological: When
the Kṛttikās went to the heaven to fill in the
gap caused by the dropping down of Abhijit,
they began to shine there as the Vahnidai-
vata नक्षत्र having the shape of a cart
(त्रिदिवं कृत्तिका गताः।नक्षत्रं शकटा-
कारं भाति तद् वह्निदैवतम्) 3. 219.

Vol. 17, p. 1090). [See Śatabhiṣaj]

विशाखा
Viśākhā f. (sg., du., pl.): Name of a
नक्षत्र।
A. Religious rites: (1) दान: Nārada
told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that if one gave to
Brāhmaṇas under the constellation Viśākhā
a bull, a milch cow, a cart supplied with
an iron yoke (? or a four-cornered cover-
ing ?) and filled with grain and clothes, he
satisfied the manes and the gods and enjoyed
infinite bliss after death; he met with no
adversities, went to heaven, obtained by
giving this gift as prescribed the desired
means of maintenance, and he certainly
never experienced sufferings of the hell and
similar places (विशाखायाम् अनड्वाहं
धेनुम् दत्त्वा च दुग्धदाम्।सप्रासङ्गं
च शकटं सधान्यं वस्त्रसंयुतम्॥ …
दत्त्वा यथोक्तं विप्रेभ्यो वृत्तिम् इष्टां
च विन्दति।नरकादींश् च संक्लेशान् नाप्-
नोतीति विनिश्चयः) 13. 63. 19-21 (unknown
commentator: सप्रासङ्गं लोहयुगादि-

पिधानयोग्यं चतुरस्रम्); (2) श्राद्ध:
Nārada told Devakī (13. 89. 1) that one who
desired to give an offering to the manes (पित्र्-
यम् ईहन्) under the Viśākhās (विशाखासु)
obtained many sons 13. 89. 8.
B. Omens:
Among the omens noticed by Vyāsa before
the start of the war and reported to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra there was one according to which
the planets Bṛhaspati and Śanaiścara were
stationed near the two Viśākhās (विशाख-
योः) and they stayed in that position for a
year (for the citation and Nī.'s commentary
see Bṛhaspati).
C. Simile: (1) Karṇa's
face, adorned with the कुण्डलस् on two sides
shone like the moon stationed between the two

of Sūrya, will be the great Manu (शनैश्-
चरः सूर्यपुत्रो भविष्यति मनुर् महान्।
तस्मिन् मन्वन्तरे चैव) 12. 337. 52;
Śanaiścara, along with the other planets,
visits the सभा of Brahman (2. 11. 20);
mentioned in the Daivatavaṃśa (13. 151.
12).
C. Name of Sūrya: Śanaiścara
appears as the 31st name in the list of a
hundred names of Sūrya taught by Dhau-
mya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 20.
D. Omens:
Among the bad omens observed by Vyāsa
before the war and reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
there was one according to which the planet
Śanaiścara was afflicting the constellation
Rohiṇī (रोहिणीं पीडयन्न् एष स्थितो राजञ्
शनैश्चरः) 6. 2. 32; but in another state-
ment Vyāsa said that Sūryaputra (i. e.
Śanaiścara) was afflicting the constellation
Bhāgya i. e. the Uttarā Phalgunī (भाग्यं
नक्षत्रम् आक्रम्य सूर्यपुत्रेण पीड्यते)
6. 3. 14 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 3. 14:
भगं नक्षत्रं पूर्वाफल्गुनी श्रुति-
मते तूत्तरा फल्गुनी); still according to
another observation of Vyāsa the two blaz-
ing planets Bṛhaspati and Śanaiścara were
stationed near the two Viśākhā stars and
had remained there for a year (संवत्सर-
स्थायिनौ च ग्रहौ प्रज्वलिताव् उभौ।
विशाखयोः समीपस्थौ बृहस्पतिशनैश्-
चरौ॥) 6. 3. 25 (for Nī.'s comm. see
Bṛhaspati); (2) According to one of the
bad omens observed by Karṇa and reported
to Kṛṣṇa, Śanaiścara was afflicting the con-
stellation Prājāpatya, i. e. Rohiṇī and as a
result was afflicting the living beings all the
more (प्राजापत्यं हि नक्षत्रं ग्रहस्
तीक्ष्णो महाद्युतिः।शनैश्चरः पीडयति
पीडयन् प्राणिनो ऽधिकम्) 5. 141. 7.
D.
Simile: (1) Śalya, fighting with Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, looked like Śanaiścara in the vicinity
of Candramas 9. 15. 10; (2) Ārjuni
(Abhimanyu) and Citrasena who came close
to each other in a duel looked like the
planets Budha and Śanaiścara in the sky
6. 100. 20; (3) Rāvaṇa approaching Sītā
looked like Śanaiścara moving near Rohiṇī
3. 265. 6.

शिशुमार
Śiśumāra m.: Designation of a group of
stars (having the shape of a dolphin), occurs
in the name of a town (?), a direction (?)
The kings and the Brāhmaṇas who came
to attend the स्वयंवर of Draupadī went
to Śiśumārapura and took residence there
(ब्राह्मणाश् च महाभागाः … शिशुमार-
पुरं प्राप्य न्यविशंस् ते च पार्थिवाः)
1. 176. 14-15 (Nī., who reads शिशुमार-
शिरः प्राप्य observes on Bom. Ed. 1. 185.
16: शिशुमारो जलजन्तुः तदाकारस् तारा-
समूहात्मको विष्णुः तस्य शिरःप्रदेशे
ऐशान्यां दिशि).

शुक्र
Śukra1 m.: Name of the planet Venus,
also called Bhārgava (7. 143. 30).
A. Description: lustrous (तेजस्विन्)
12. 278. 5.
B. History: (1) Yudhiṣṭhira
once asked Bhīṣma how Uśanas of im-
perishable lustre became Śukra and how he
acquired prosperity (कथं चाप्य् उशना
प्राप शुक्त्रत्वम् अमरद्युतिः।ऋद्धिं
स च कथं प्राप्तः) 12. 278. 4 (Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5 explains
शुक्रत्वं अस् शुक्रोत्पन्नत्वम्, cf. स विनिष्-
क्रम्य शिश्नेन शुक्रत्वम् अभिपेदिवान् 12.
278. 32); Yudhiṣṭhira also asked Bhīṣma
why does Śukra not move through the middle
of the sky (न याति च स तेजस्वी मध्येन
नभसः कथम्) 12. 278. 5; 12. 278. 32
(Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 289. 5:
तस्य आकाशगतिः कुतः कुण्ठितेत्य् अर्थः।
सप्तर्षिवद् द्वीरूपेण स्थितस्य शुक्रस्य
भूस्थमूर्तिविषयक एवायं प्रश्नो न
भचक्रस्थमूर्तिविषयः तेन यथा भौ-
मानां वसिष्ठादीनां स्वर्गे ऽपि गतिर् अस्ति
नैवं भौमस्य शुक्रस्यास्तीति गम्यते।);
(2) Parāśara told Janaka that Uśanas be-
came Śukra by propitiating Devadeva (Śiva);
and by praising Devī (Umā) he, covered
with lustre, delights in the sky (गतः
शुक्रत्वम् उशना देवदेवप्रसादनात्।
देवीं स्तुत्वा तु गगने मोदते तेजसा वृतः)
12. 281. 14 (a reference to 12. 278. 13-37);
(3) Planet Śukra is the son of Kavi
(शुक्रः कविसुतो ग्रहः) 1. 60. 40 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 1. 66. 42: शुक्रो ग्रह-
त्वाद् एव लोकानां प्राणयात्रायां वर्षा-
वर्षादिकार्ये नियुक्तः)
C. Importance:
(1) Śukra, along with other planets, visits
the सभा of Brahman 2. 11. 20; (2) finds
place in the Daivatavaṃśa 13. 151. 12.
D. Name of Sūrya: Śukra appears as the 23rd
name in the list of the 108 names of Sūrya
taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 19.
E. Auspicious: (1) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra
heard that the planet Śukra and Sūrya
both together were favourable to the sons
of Kuntī for their victory in war he did
not hope to win (यदाश्रौषं शुक्र-
सूर्यौ च युक्तौ कौन्तेयानाम् अनुलोमौ
जयाय … तदा नासंसे विजयाय संजय॥)
1. 1. 129; (2) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira
that in wars, victory was on that side for
which wind, Sūrya and the planet Śukra were
favourable; if they all were simultaneously
present, each time the former was stronger
than the latter (यतो वायुर् यतः सूर्यो
यतः शुक्रस् ततो जयः।पूर्वं पूर्वं
ज्याय एषां संनिपाते युधिष्ठिर 12. 101.
17.
F. Bad effect: While Śukra is in
conjunction with the two Proṣṭhapadās it has
wealth (as Kubera, the lord of riches, also
has); Śukra in that position takes away from
men whatever they have earned according to
their desires 5. 112. 3 (for citation and Nī.'s
comm. see Pūrvā Bhādrapadā); (for Śukra
as a great sage and perfect in योग depriv-
ing also Kubera of his wealth see 12. 278.
7-9).
G. Omens: Among the bad omens
noticed by the Vyāsa before the war one was
related to Śukra's ascending the Pūrva
Proṣṭhapada and then, after going over to the
Uttara Proṣṭhapada, both looking back at
the Pūrva Proṣṭhapada 6. 3. 14 (for citation
see Uttarā Bhādrapadā).
H. Similes:
(1) The battle between Drupada and Jaya-
dratha, delightful to the spectators (ईक्षितृ-
प्रीतिजननम्), was like the one between
Śukra and Aṅgāraka 6. 43. 54; (2) Droṇa
and Arjuna met in battle like Budha and
Śukra in the sky (नभस्तले) 6. 97. 57;
(3) The battle between Prativindhya and
Duḥśāsana was like the one between Budha
and Bhārgava (Śukra) in a cloudless sky
(व्यपेतजलदे व्योम्नि) 7. 143. 30; (4)
Arjuna, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki by his
side in the chariot, looked like the darkness-
destroying Śaśin with Budha and Śukra 7.
60. 20. [For Śukra also see Section 1. 7]

शुक्र
Śukra2 m.: Name of the month Jyaiṣṭha,
mentioned mostly along with Śuci.
Similes: (1) When Bhīma strode fast,
wind generated by the speed of his thighs

1. 138. 1. (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 151. 2:
शुचिशुक्रागमे ज्येष्ठाषाढयोः समये);
(2) Duryodhana, burning with anger after
witnessing the Rājasūya of the Pāṇḍavas, was
drying up as does scanty water at the advent
of Jyaiṣṭha and Āṣāḍha (शुचिशुक्रागमे काले
शुष्ये तोयम् इवाल्पकम्) 2. 43. 21 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 2. 47. 24: शुचिशुक्रौ ज्येष्ठा-
षाढौ तयोर् आगमे ग्रीष्मर्तौ); (3)
Arjuna, tormenting his enemies with his
Gāṇḍīva bow drawn full circle and his
arrows issuing from it like hot rays, shone
like the haloed sun in the middle of the
months Jyaiṣṭha and Āṣāḍha (तपन् रिपून्
अर्जुनभास्करो बभौ।शरोग्ररश्मिः
शुचिशुक्रमध्यगो यथैव सूर्यः परि-
वेषगस् तथा॥) 8. 57. 57. [See Jyeṣṭhā-
mūla]

शुचि
Śuci m.: Name of the month Āṣāḍha,
mentioned mostly with Śukra2.
Simile: Droṇa, showering (arrows) like
hail stones frightened his enemies as does the
roaring and windly Parjanya at the end of
the month Śuci (i. e. at the end of Āṣāḍha,
or at the end of the hot season ?) (नान-
द्यमानः पर्जन्यः सानिलः शुचिसंक्षये।
अश्मवर्षम् इवावर्षत् परेषाम् आवहद्
भयम्॥) 7. 13. 5 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7.

constellations, started to create, in addition
to the existing galaxies of constellations,
counter-constellations starting with Śravaṇa
(अति नक्षत्रवंशांश् च क्रुद्धो नक्षत्र-
संपदा।प्रति श्रवणपूर्वाणि नक्षत्राणि
ससर्ज यः॥) 1. 65. 34.
B. Auspi-
cious: Balarāma left for his तीर्थयात्रा
under the constellation Puṣya and returned,
after forty days, under the constellation
Śravaṇa (चत्वारिंशद् अहान्य् अद्य द्वे च

ऽस्मि श्रवणे पुनर् आगतः॥) 9. 33. 5
(see the Editor's note on the stanza Cr. Ed.
Vol. 11, p. 489).
C. Religious rites:
(1) दान: Nārada told Devakī (13. 63. 2-4)
that if one gave under the constellation
Śravaṇa a gift of a woolen blanket with a
piece of a cloth attached from inside, he
could reach to all the worlds which remained
unconcealed from him (?) in a bright con-
veyance (श्रवणे कम्बलं दत्त्वा वस्त्रान्-
तरितम् एव च।श्वेतेन याति यानेन सर्वान्
लोकान् असंवृतान्) 13. 63. 28; (2) श्राद्ध:
Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that by
performing a काम्य श्राद्ध under Śravaṇa

(प्रेत्य गच्छेत् परां गतिम्) 13. 89. 11.
D. Omens: (1) According to one of the
bad omens for the armies noticed by Vyāsa
before the war, the planet Bṛhaspati was
taking retrograde step under Śravaṇa
(मघास्व् अङ्गारको वक्रः श्रवणे च
बृहस्पतिः) 6. 3. 13; (2) According to
another omen noticed by Vyāsa the planet
Mars, after taking repeated retrograde steps
(under Maghā ?), had returned to Brahma-
rāśi and remained steady in Śravaṇa 6. 3. 17
(for the citation and Nī.'s comm. see Bra-
hmarāśi p. 260 above). [See Brahmarāśi,
Vaiṣṇava and Śraviṣṭhā]

श्रविष्ठा
Śraviṣṭhā f.: Name of a constellation.
According to Brahmadeva the constella-
tions began with Śraviṣṭhā (श्रविष्ठादीनि
ऋक्षाणि) 14. 44. 2 (व्। ल्। श्रवणादीनि, see
Śravaṇa above, section A).

श्रावण
Śrāvaṇa m.: Name of a month.
Aṅgiras had told Bhīṣma that if one
remained controlled and spent the month of
Śrāvaṇa taking food only once a day he was
given the honour of अभिषेक (ceremonial
bath ?) wherever he went and became the
prosperer of his kinsmen (श्रावणं नियतो
मासम् एकभक्तेन यः क्षपेत्।यत्र
तत्राभिषेकेण युज्यते ज्ञातिवर्धनः॥)
13. 109. 26.

श्रीपञ्चमी
Śrīpañcamī f.: Name of the fifth day
(of the bright fortnight of the month of
Māgha).
When Devasenā received Skanda for her
husband, Lakṣmī, in person, attended on him;
since Skanda was chosen by Śri (Lakṣmī) on
the fifth day (of the month of Māgha), that
day became known as Śrīpañcamī. (यदा
स्कन्दः पतिर् लब्धः शाश्वतो देवसेनया।
तदा तम् आश्रयल् लक्ष्मीः स्वयं देवी
शरीरिणी॥श्रीजुष्टः पञ्चमीं स्कन्दस्
तस्माच् छ्रीपञ्चमी स्मृता) 3. 218. 48-49.

षष्ठी
Ṣaṣṭhī f.: Name of the sixth day of the
bright half of the month of Māgha (?).
A. Description: important (महातिथि)
3. 218. 49.
B. Mythological Event:
Skanda married Devasenā on the fifth day
of the month of Māgha, and on the sixth
day he achieved his objective; hence Ṣaṣṭhī
is an important day (षष्ट्यां कृतार्थो
ऽभूद् यस्मात् तस्मात् षष्ठी महातिथिः)
3. 218. 49.

सप्तर्षि
Saptarṣi m.: (pl.): The seven stars
forming the constellation Ursa Major.
A. Description: lofty (उदार) 6. 3.
24.
B. Placement in the sky: Suparṇa
told Gālava that the place of the Seven Sages
was in the north (अत्र (i. e. उत्तरायां
दिशि 5. 109. 3) ते ऋषयः सप्त) 5. 109. 12;
Mārkaṇḍeya, while instructing Yudhiṣṭhira,
told him that to honour the old injunction
laid down by Brahman the Saptarṣis shine
in the sky; hence no one should violate the
injunction considering himself to be strong
(धात्रा विधिर् यो विहितः पुराणस् तं
पूजयन्तो नरवर्य सन्तः।सप्तर्षयः
पार्थ दिवि प्रभान्ति नेशे बलस्येति चरेद्
अधर्मम्) 3. 26. 13.
C. Auspicious in
wars: Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that the
soldiers in the army, while fighting, should
keep the constellation Ursa Major at the
back and remain steady like mountains;
this way one could wish to win even the
unconquerable opponents (सप्तर्षीन् पृष्ठ-
तः कृत्वा युध्येरन्न् अचला इव।अनेन
विधिना राजञ् जिगीषेतापि दुर्जयान्) 12. 101.
16.
D. Omens: Among the omens
noticed by Vyāsa before the war one was
related to the position of the two planets
having copper-red and ruddy crests (Rāhu
and Ketu ?) who obscured the brilliance of
the lofty stars of the Ursa Major (ग्रहौ
ताम्रारुणशिखौ प्रज्वलन्ताव् इव स्थितौ।
सप्तर्षीणाम् उदाराणां समवच्छाद्य वै
प्रभाम्) 6. 3. 24.
E. Similes: (1)
The sages in the आश्रम of Tanu sat
around the king, father of Bhūridyumna,
placing him in front as do the stars of the
constellation Ursa Major the Polar star
(ततस् ते मुनयः सर्वे परिवार्य नरर्-
षभम्।उपाविशन् पुरस्कृत्य सप्तर्षय
इव ध्रुवम्॥) 12. 126. 25; (2) The
Brāhmaṇa instructed his wife that there was
only one relative, no other; he dwelt in our
heart; (in saying this) the Brāhmaṇa was only
repeating what the relative within had said
to him: instructed by the relative within
people have relatives; they shine (like ?) the
stars of the Ursa Major (एको बन्धुर् नास्ति
ततो द्वितीयो यो हृच्छयस् तम् अहम् अनु-
ब्रवीमि।तेनानुशिष्टा बान्धवा बन्धुमन्-
तः सप्तर्षयः सप्त दिवि प्रभान्ति) 14.

वास्या सा सिनीवाली योत्तरा सा कुहूः; also
cf. Nirukta 11. 31).
A. Personification: Personified as the
third daughter of Aṅgiras, of matted hair;
on account of her thinness people said that
she vanished no sooner she was seen (यां
कपर्दिसुताम् आहुर् दृश्यादृश्येति देहिनः।
तनुत्वात् सा सिनीवालि तृतीयाङ्गिरसः सुता॥)
3. 208. 5 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 3. 218.
5: कपर्दिनो रुद्रस्य सुताम् इव सुतां
चन्द्रकलां ललाटे धृतत्वात्। … चतुर्दशी-
युक्तामावास्या सिनीवाली).
B. Name of
Devasenā: Brāhmaṇas called Devasenā, the
chief queen of Skanda, by different names,
one of them being Sinīvālī (देवसेनां …
यां ब्राह्मणाः प्राहुः … सिनीवालीम्)
3. 218. 47.
C. Mythological events: (1)
Sinīvālī formed one of the reins (योक्त्राणी)
of the chariot of Śiva when it was made ready
for fight with the Tripuras 8. 24. 74; (2)

investiture (अभिषेक) of Kumāra (Skanda)
9. 44. 12.

सूर्य
Sūrya m.: Name of the planet Sun,
referred to also as Āditya and by its other
synonyms like Arka, Ravi, Bhāskara,
Bhānu, Pataṃga.
A. Origin and activity: According to
Bhīṣma, Āditya, along with Candra, other
planets, constellations and stars were born
from Viṣvaksena (i. e. Kṛṣṇa) (चन्द्रादि-
त्यौ ग्रहनक्षत्रताराः … विष्वक्सेनात्
सर्वम् एतत् प्रसूतम्) 13. 143. 31; Puru-
sottama (Nārāyaṇa) told the seven sages,
Marīci and others, that Sūrya, Candramas,
all constellations act in their own prescribed
way in their respective spheres and are
considered an authority (सुर्याचन्द्रमसौ
 … सर्वे च नक्षत्रगणाः … अधिकारेषु
वर्तन्ते यथास्वम् … सर्वे प्रमाणं हि
12. 322. 39-40.
B. Description: Radiant
(गभस्तिमन्त्) 2. 11. 17; (अंशुमन्त्)
6. 32. 21; rich in light (विभारसु) 6. 13.
44; very generous (परमोदार) 6. 13. 44.
C. Extent: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to
tell him everything about the extent (सर्वं
प्रमाणम्) of Arka, to which Saṃjaya agreed
6. 12. 3-4; according to Saṃjaya's information
the diameter (विष्कम्भ) of Sūrya was 1000
योजनस् and the circumference (मण्डल)
was 30000 योजनस्; (according to the
learned Pauraṇīkas) Sūrya's expanse (?
विपुलत्व) was 5800 योजनस् (सूर्यस् त्व्
अष्टौ सहस्राणि द्वे चान्ये कुरुनदन।
विष्कम्भेण, ततो राजन् मण्डलं त्रिंश-
तं समम्॥अष्टपञ्चाशतं राजन् विपुल्-
अत्वेन चानघ।श्रूयते परमोदारः
पतंगो ऽसौ विभावसुः।एतत् प्रमाणम्
अर्कस्य निर्डिष्टम् इह भारत) 6. 13. 43-
44 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets
विपुलत्वेन as ततो ऽप्य् आधिकेयेन; in that
case the circumference of Sūrya will be
30000 + 5800 = 35800 योजनस्; see also the
Editor's note on the stanza 6. 13. 41, Vol.
7, p. 765); on account of the larger extent
of Rāhu, it covers Candra and Āditya at
proper times (स राहुश् छादयत्य् एतौ
यथाकालं महत्तया।चन्द्रादित्यौ)
6. 13. 45.
D. Importance: (1) Upamanyu
while praising Śiva said that he (Śiva) was
Sūrya among the planets (ग्रहाणां सूर्य
उच्यसे) 13. 14. 156; Sūrya appears in a
complex name of Śiva (चन्द्रसूर्यगतिः)
13. 17. 37; (2) Śiva made Bhāskara the
chief of the luminous bodies (तेजसां
भास्करं चक्रे (ईशम्)) 12. 122. 31;
Brahmā told the sages that Sūrya was the
chief of the planets (सूर्यो ग्रहाणाम् अधि-
पः) 14. 43. 6; Arka was known as the
chief of the hot luminaries (अर्को ऽधिपतिर्
उष्णानाम्) 14. 43. 7; also cf. आदित्यो ज्योति-
षाम् पतिः 6. 7. 14; खेचराणां प्रवरो
यथार्कः 1. 83. 7; (3) Bhagavān, while
narrating his विभूतिस्, said that he was
Ravi among the luminous bodies (ज्योतिषां
रविर् अंशुमान्) 6. 32. 21; (4) The
divine sages, the Siddhas, and the great
sages saw Candra, Āditya and Budha, among
others, in the abode of Brahman 1. 203. 4;
Āditya, along with Candra and constellations,
wait on Brahmadeva in his सभा 2. 11. 17;
E. Advent of the Kṛtayuga: Mārkaṇḍeya
told the Pāṇḍavas that when Candra, Sūrya,
the constellation Tiṣya (Puṣya) and Bṛhas-
pati will come together in one राशि, the
Kṛtayuga will set in 3. 188. 87 (for citation
and Nī.'s commentary on it, see above
Puṣya1, p. 257. 1).
F. Mythological
events: (1) Candra, Āditya, the planets,
the stars, the constellations and the denizens
of the heaven felt dejected due to the
destruction caused by Sunda and Upasunda
(चन्द्रादित्यौ ग्रहास् तारा नक्षत्राणि
दिवौकसः।जग्मुर् विषादम्) 1. 202. 26;
(2) when the gods made ready a chariot for
Śiva's fight with the Tripuras, Sūrya and
Candramas were made the two wheels of the
excellent chariot (सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ कृत्वा
चक्रे रथवरोत्तमे) 8. 24. 71.
G.
Auspicious: (1) Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira
that in war the side which had wind, Sūrya
and Śukra favourable to it became victorious;
if they were simultaneously present, the former
of the two proved stronger (यतो वायुर्
यतः सूर्य्ō यतः शुक्रस् ततो जयः।
पूर्वं पूर्वं ज्याय एषां संनिपाते
युधिष्ठिर॥) 12. 101. 17; (2) Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra told Saṃjaya that when he heard that
both Śukra and Sūrya were favourable to
Pāṇḍavas indicating their victory, he lost
all hopes of winning the war (यदा श्रौ-
षम् शुक्रसूर्यौ च युक्तौ कौन्तेयानाम्
अनुकूलौ जयाय। … तदा नाशंसे विज-
याय संजय॥) 1. 1. 129.
H. Omens:
(1) According to an astronomical event
which took place before the war and which
was noticed by Vyāsa, अमावास्या occurred
on the thirteenth day of the month which
was very unusual; on that occasion Candra
and Sūrya were untimely swallowed the same
month by Rāhu which indicated destruction
of the subjects (चतुर्दशीं पञ्चदशीम्
भूतपूर्वां च षोडशीम्।इमां तु नाभि-
जानामि अमावास्यां त्रयोदशीम्॥चन्द्र-
सूर्याव् उभौ ग्रस्ताव् एकमासे त्रयोदशीम्।
अपर्वणि ग्रहाव् एतौ प्रजाः संक्षपयि-
ष्यतः॥) 6. 3. 28-29 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
6. 3. 28: पर्व दर्शाख्यं पञ्चदशे
ऽह्नि भवति।एकतिथिवृद्धौ षोडशे वा
एकतिथिक्षये चतुर्दशे वाह्नि भवति।
तिथिद्वयक्षयस् तु लोके ऽत्यन्तम् अप्रसिद्-
ध इत्य् अपर्वणित्य् उक्तम्।ग्रहं यातौ
राहुणा ग्रहणं प्राप्तौ एतद् एव प्रजा-
संक्षयहेतुत्वेन शास्त्रे दृष्टम्।); a
similar event—Rāhu swallowing both Āditya
and Soma simultaneously—also occurred
when the Sindhu heroes fought Arjuna and
at that time the meteors struck Sūrya and
were scattered (उल्काश् च जघ्निरे सूर्यं
विकीर्यन्त्यः समन्ततः) 14. 76. 15-16;
for Rāhu's swallowing Āditya out of time
(अपर्वणि) also cf. 2. 71. 26, and 9. 55.
10; also cf. 5. 141. 10; and 6. 3. 11 (in the
last two references अपर्वणि does not occur);
(for Nī.'s comment on Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11
see Rāhu above p. 267. 1 and on Bom. Ed.
6. 3. 11 he says: तत्र तुलास्थम् अर्कं
राहुर् उपैति); (2) According to another
omen noticed by Vyāsa, Arka, Indu and the
constellations were blazing day and night
irrespective of the fact whether it was day
time or night time; that also indicated des-
struction (ज्वलितार्केन्दुनक्षत्रम् निर्विशे-
षदिनक्षपम्।अहोरात्रं मया दृष्तं
तत् क्षयाय भविष्यति) 6. 2. 22; (3)
According to an omen noticed by Karṇa, a
line of black clouds covered Bhānu at dawn
and dusk which foretold great danger (कृष्णश्
च परिघस् तत्र भानुम् आवृत्य तिष्ठति।
उदयास्तम्ये संध्ये वेदयानो महद्
भयम्॥) 5. 141. 22 (but Nī. on Bom.
Ed 5. 143. 23: परिघः परिवेशः); (4)
According to the omens noticed by Saṃjaya,
when the two armies faced each other at
Kurukṣetra, Āditya at its rise appeared as
though split into two (द्विधाभूत इवादित्य
उदये प्रत्यदृश्यत) 6. 17. 3; (5) When
Karṇa marched out for war many unusual
happenings (उत्पातस्) occurred, one of them
being that seven major planets were seen
issuing out of Sūrya (निश्चरन्तो व्यदृश्यन्त
सूर्यात् सप्त महाग्रहाः) 8. 26. 34 (Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 8. 37. 4: निश्चरन्तो
युद्धार्थम् इति शेषः।सुआर्यात् सूर्यम्
आरभ्य सूर्यादयो ऽन्योन्यम् युध्यन्तीत्य्
अर्थः); (6) Yājñavalkya told Janaka that
if one saw the moon (Soma) or the sun (Saha-
srāṃśu) with a hole (in the middle) like a
wheel with a broken nave he had only a week
to live (शीर्णनाभि यथा चाक्रं छिद्रं
सोमं प्रपश्यति।तथैव च सहस्रां-
शुं सप्तरात्रेण मृत्युभाक्) 12. 305. 13.
I. Similes: (1) Draupadī's five sons rushed
at the demon Ārśyaśṛṅgi (Alambusa) as five
planets rush at Ravi (ग्रहाः पञ्च यथा
रविम्) 6. 96. 35; (2) Bhīmasena, encircled
by the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, looked like Sūrya
encircled by fierce planets at the time of the
destruction of the people (प्रजासंहरणे
सूर्यः क्रूरैर् इव महाग्रहैः) 6. 73. 10;
(3) Lakṣmaṇa and Rāma, surrounded by
the monkey-chiefs, looked like Candra and
Sūrya surrounded by the planets (चन्द्र-
सूर्यौ ग्रहैर् वृतौ) 3. 267. 17. [For
Sūrya also see Section 1. 7 where other re-
ferences to the sun's eclipse can be found]

सूर्यपुत्र
Sūryaputra m.: See Śanaiścara.

सोम
Soma m.: Name of the planet moon,
referred to also as Candra or Candramas
and by its other synonyms such as Indu,
Śaśin, Niśākara.
A. Origin and activity: According to
Bhīṣma, Candra, Āditya and other planets,
the constellations and stars were born from
Viṣvaksena (i. e. Kṛṣṇa) (चन्द्रादित्यौ
ग्रहनक्षत्रताराः … विष्वक्सेनात् सर्वम्
एतत् प्रसूतम्) 13. 143. 31; Puruṣottama
(Nārāyaṇa) told the seven sages, Marīci
and others, that the sun, the moon, all con-
stellations act in their own prescribed way in
their respective spheres and are considered an
authority (सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ … अद्निकारेषु
वर्तन्ते यथास्वं … सर्वे प्रमाणं हि)
12. 322. 39-40.
B. Born repeatedly,
its waxing and waning: The moon is born
repeatedly (चन्द्रमा जायते पुनः) 3. 297.
47; vanishes thousands of times (चन्द्रमा
इव … सहस्रशः।लीयते) 12. 293. 3; the
moon waxes and wanes (क्षयं वृद्धिं च
चन्द्रस्य) 12. 290. 46; the moon on the
new moon day remains only as a very thin
digit (विद्धि चन्द्रमसं दर्शे सूक्ष्मया
कलया स्थितम्) 12. 233. 15; the fifteen
digits of the moon are its source and abode;
the moon also has a sixteenth digit, which
is very thin, and that is the real moon; that
digit is not used by gods but it favours
gods (?) (कलाः पञ्चदशा योनिस् तद्
धाम इति पठ्यते।नित्यम् एतद् विजानीहि
सोमः षोडशमी कला। … षोडशा तु कला
सूक्ष्मा स सोम उपधार्यताम्।न तूप-
युज्यते देवैर् देवान् उपयनकति सा॥)
12. 293. 4, 6 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 304. 6:
देवैर् इन्द्रियैर् न उपयुज्यते पाल्यते किं-
तु देवान् एव सत्तास्फूर्तिप्रदानेन उप-
युनक्ति पालयति).
C. Description: high-
souled (महात्मन्) 6. 13. 42; whose rays
are cool (शीतरश्मि) 6. 13. 42;
D. Ex-
tent: Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to tell
him everything about the extent (सर्वं
प्रमाणम्) of Soma, to which Saṃjaya
agreed 6. 12. 3-4; according to Saṃjaya's
information the diameter (विष्कम्भ) of
Candramas was 11000 योजनस् and its cir-
cumference (मण्डलम्) 33000 योजनस्;
(according to the learned Paurāṇikas) the
expanse (वैपुल्य) of the moon was 5900
योजनस् (चन्द्रमास् तु सहस्राणि राजन्न्
एकादश स्मृतः।विष्कम्भेण कुरुश्रेष्ठ
त्रयस्त्रिंशत् तु मण्डलम्॥एकोनशष्टिर्
वैपुल्याच् छीतरश्मेर् महात्मनः) 6. 13.
42 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 12. 41 interprets
विपुलत्वेन as ततो ऽप्य् आधिक्येन; in that
case moon's circumference will be 33000 +
5900 = 38900; see also the editor's note on
the stanza 6. 13. 41, Vol. 7, p. 765); on
account of the larger extent of Rāhu, it covers
the sun and the moon at proper times (स
राहुश् छादयत्य् एतौ यथाकालं महत्-
तया।चन्द्रादित्यौ) 6. 13. 45.
E.
Importance: (1) Upamanyu, while praising
Śiva, said that he (Śiva) was Candramas
among the नक्षत्रस् (नक्षत्राणां च
चन्द्रमाः) 13. 14. 156; Soma appears
among the names of Śiva (सोमो नक्षत्र-
साधकः) 13. 17. 36; also Candra in a com-
plex form (चन्द्रसूर्यगतिः) 13. 17. 37;
(2) Soma appears as one of the names of
Sūrya taught by Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3.
3. 19; (3) God Śiva made moon (Niśā-
kara) the chief of the constellations (चक्रे
नक्षत्राणां निशाकरम् (ईशम्)) 12. 122.
31; Candramas is known as the chief of the
constellations (नक्षत्राणां च चन्द्रमाः
(अधिपः)) 14. 43. 6; Indu is known as
the chief of the luminous bodies (ज्योतिषाम्
इन्दुर् (अधिपतिः) उच्यते) 14. 43. 7; hence
Soma is called ग्रहगणेश्वर 13. 66. 12;
ग्रहपति 12. 118. 15; 12. 162. 24; Candra
and Sūrya are surrounded by the planets
(चन्द्रसूर्यौ ग्रहैर् वृतौ) 3. 267. 17;
moon is नक्षत्रराज् 3. 226. 10; 12. 29.
123; it is surrounded by the नक्षत्रस् 5.
138. 27; it is accompanied by the नक्षत्रस्
(सनक्षत्रः) 6. 7. 14; followed by the
planets, constellations and stars 3. 266. 2;
shines along with the planets and many con-
stellations 3. 179. 12; called ताराधिप 1. 61.
30; 3. 264. 18, 20; 11. 19. 17; 12. 289. 60;
12. 327. 8; 13. 124. 4; तारापति 3. 264. 38;
3. 277. 22; 3. 292. 1; तारकाराज 3. 42. 14.
उडुराज् 9. 34. 36; 12. 52. 18; 13. 14. 110;
14. 63. 3; उडुपति 9. 50. 1; उडुप 3. 146.
68; (4) Soma is also the lord of the plants
(ओषधीनां पतिः) 14. 43. 8; (5) Candra,
along with Āditya and Budha, present in the
abode of Brahmadeva 1. 203. 4; Candramas
and the constellations wait on Brahmadeva
in his सभा 2. 11. 17-18.
F. Advent of
Kṛta Yuga: When the Moon, the Sun, the
Tiṣya (Puṣya) and Bṛhaspati will come in
one राशि, the Kṛta age will commence 3.
188. 87 (for the citation and Nī.'s com,
on it see Puṣya1, p. 257. 1).
G. Mytho-
logical events: (1) Pained due to the des-
truction indulged in by Sunda and Upasunda,
the moon, the sun, the planets, the stars, the
constellations and the denizens of the heaven
felt dejected (चन्द्रादित्यौ ग्रहास् तारा
नक्षत्राणि दिवौकसः।जग्मुर् विषादम्)
1. 202. 26; (2) When the gods made
ready an excellent chariot for Śiva's fight
with the Tripuras, Sūrya and Candramas
were made its wheels (सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ
कृत्वा चक्रे रथवरोत्तमे) 8. 24. 71.
H. Auspicious conjunction: (1) Kuntī
gave birth to Yudhiṣṭhira when the moon
was in conjunction with the Aindra (Jyeṣṭhā)
नक्षत्र (ऐन्द्रे चन्द्रसमायुक्ते) 1.
114. 4-5; (2) Vyāsa asked first Yudhi-
ṣṭhira to take the hand of Draupadī (in
marriage) since that was an auspicious
day on which Candramas would he in con-
junction with the Puṣya constellation (for
the citation and Nī.'s comment on it see
above Pauṣya p. 259. 1); (3) Daśaratha
asked his Purohita to make preparations for
the consecration of Rāma as heir-apparent
since on that night the moon would be
in conjunction with the Puṣya which was an
auspicious योग (अध्य पुष्यो निशि ब्रह्मन्
पुण्यं योगम् उपैष्यति) 3. 261. 15;
I. Omens: (1) While pointing out different
bad omens to Kṛṣṇa, Karṇa said that the
mark on Soma had disappeared (सोमस्य
लक्ष्म व्यावृत्तम्) 5. 141. 10 (But Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 5. 143. 11: लक्ष्म व्यावृत्तं
क्षीणत्वाद् अमावास्यासान्निध्यात् क्षीणचन्द्रो
ऽपि पाप एव); the same bad omen was
noticed by Vyāsa also which, according to him,
indicated great danger (व्यावृत्तं लक्ष्म
सोमस्य भविष्यति महद् भयम्) 6. 2.
32 (Here Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 2. 32: व्या-
वृत्तं नष्टं लक्ष्महीनश् चन्द्र दृश्यत
इत्य् अर्थः); a similar sight was noticeable
at the junction of the Tretā and the Dvāpara
when there occurred a drought for twelve
years; at that time Soma, with its mark
disappeared, receded to the south (जगाम
दक्षिणं मारगं सोमो व्यावृत्तलक्षणः)
12. 139. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 141. 15:
व्यावृत्तं अन्यथाभूतं लक्षणं चिह्नं
यस्य); (2) According to another omen
noticed by Vyāsa and reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
the moon on the Kārttikī full moon night,
being without lustre, was (sometimes ?) not
visible, and (at other times ?) with the
colour of fire appeared in the sky which had
the same colour (अलक्ष्यः प्रभया हीनः
पौर्णमासीं च कार्त्तिकीम्।चन्द्रो ऽभूद्
अग्निवर्णश् च समवर्णे नभस्तले) 6.
2. 23; (3) According to a third omen
noticed by Vyāsa, whether it was day or
night, the sun, the moon and the constellations
appeared blazing; that indicated destruction
(ज्वलितार्केन्दुनक्षत्रं निर्विशेषदिनक्ष-
पम्।अहोरात्रं मया दृष्टं तत् क्षयाय
भविष्यति॥) 6. 2. 22; (4) According to
another astronomical event, Vyāsa noticed
that the अमावास्या had occurred on the
thirteenth day of the month which was very
unusual; on that day Candra and Sūrya
both were swallowed the same month by
Rāhu at an improper time 6. 2. 28-29 (for
citation and Nī.'s commentary see Sūrya
p. 276. 2); (5) A similar event-Rāhu
swallowed Āditya and at the same time
Soma-occurred when the Sindhu heroes
fought with Arjuna (राहुर् अग्रसद् आदित्यं
युगपत् सोमम् एव च) 14. 76. 15; (6)
Saṃjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the day on
which the two armies gathered at Kurukṣetra,
Soma was in the constellation Maghā and the
seven principal planets gathered in the sky
blazing (for the citation and Nī.'s commen-
tary on it see above Maghā, p. 263. 1);
(7) Yājñavalkya told Janataka that one to
whom the full moon appeared broken towards
the south had only a year to live (पुर्णेन्-
दुं (दीपम् एव च)।खण्डाभासं दक्षि-
णतस् ते ऽपि संवत्सरायुषः॥) 12. 305. 9;
(8) He also told Janaka that one who saw
Soma with a hole like a wheel with a broken
nave had only a week to live (शीर्णनाभि
यथा चक्रं छिद्रं सोमं प्रपश्यति।
सप्तरात्रेण मृत्युभाक्) 12. 305. 13.
J. Similes: (1) Rohiṇī's association with
the moon: Sudeva wondered when would
Damayantī be associated with Nala, as
Rohiṇī with Śaśin, and end her miseries
(रोहिणी शशिनो यथा) 3. 65. 21; Śāntā
waited on Ṛśyaśrṅga as Rohiṇī on Soma
(खे रोहिणी सोमम् इवामुकूला) 3. 113. 22;
Kuntī blessed Draupadi after her marriage
saying that she might be united with her
husbands as Rohiṇī with Soma (रोहिणी च
यथा सोमे) 1. 191. 5; also cf. चन्द्रश् च
रोहिण्याम् 5. 115. 9; रोहिणी शशिनः 13. 134.
4; (2) Moon's association with the other
नक्षत्रस्: (i) Kṛttikās: The king of the
Prāgjyotiṣa with a white parasol decorated
with garlands (मालयदामवता … श्वेतच्छ-
त्रेण) shone like the moon on a full moon
day in conjunction with the Kṛttikās (कृ-
त्तिकायोगयुक्तेन पौर्णमास्याम् इवेन्दुना)
7. 19. 18; (ii) Sāvitra: Droṇa in the
company of the five Pāṇḍava brothers looked
like the moon in association with the constel-
lation Sāvitra (i. e. Hasta) consisting of
five stars (पञ्चतारेण संयुक्तः सावित्रे-
णेव चन्द्रमाः) 1. 125. 30 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 1. 135. 30: सावित्रेण हस्तनक्षत्रेण);
(iii) Punarvasū: the two Pāñcāla heroes
(पाञ्चाल्यौ), guarding the wheels of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, shone like the two Punaravasu stars
on the two sides of the moon (रथाभ्याशे
चकाशेते चन्द्रस्येव पुनर्वसू) 8. 33. 16;
(iv) Viśākhā: Karṇa with the two shin-
ing कुण्डलस् in his ears appeared like the
bright moon in the sky with two Viśākhā
stars on each side (विशाखयोर् मध्य-
गतः शशीव विमलो दिवि) 3. 285. 11; the
head of the Pāṇḍya king wearing the
कुण्डलस् shone like the moon with two
Viśākhā stars on two sides 8. 15. 42; also
8. 14. 50; (v) Constellations or stars in
general: Balarāma of white complexion and
wearing a blue garment (नीलवासाः सित-
प्रभः), seated among the kings, appeared
like the moon among the constellations
(नक्षत्रगणैः परिकीर्णो निशाकरः) 9.
33. 17; 9. 54. 42; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that he,
among the Pāṇḍavas, would appear like the
moon among the नक्षत्रस् 5. 138. 27; the
sons of Draupadī, with their followers, stood
round Dhṛṣṭadyumna like the multitude of
stars around the moon (चन्द्रं तारागणा
इव) 8. 32. 6; when king Sagara, followed
by his 60000 sons, moved he looked liked
the king of the नक्षत्रस् (i. e. the moon)
followed by luminous bodies in a cloudless
sky at the end of the rainy season (नक्ष-
त्रराजं वर्षान्ते व्यभ्रे ज्योतिर्गणा इव)
12. 29. 123; (3) Moon's association with
planets: (i) Aṅgāraka: Droṇa entered the
arena with Aśvatthāhman as the moon enters
a cloudless sky in the company of Aṅgāraka
(नभो जलधरैर् हीनं साङ्गारक इवां-
शुमान्) 1. 124. 18; (ii) Budha and
Śukra: Arjuna, with Kṛṣṇa and Sātyaki by
his side in the chariot, looked like the moon
destroying the darkness in the company of
Budha and Śukra (सहितो बुधशुक्राभ्यां
तमो निघ्नन् यथा शशी) 7. 60. 20; (iii)
Śanaiścara: Śalya drawing near Yudhi-
ṣṭhira looked like the planet Śanaiścara
drawing near the moon (चन्द्रमसो
ऽभ्याशे शनैश्चर इव ग्रहः) 9. 15. 10;
(iv) Planets in general: Lakṣmaṇa and
Rāma surrounded by the monkey chiefs look-
ed like the moon and the sun surrounded by
the planets (चन्द्रसूर्यौ ग्रहैर् इव) 3.
267. 17; the seven Kaurava brothers tormented
Bhīmasena (by showering arrows) as do the
seven planets the moon at the time of the
destruction of the creatures (प्रजासंह-
रणे राजन् सोमं सप्त ग्रहा इव) 7. 112.
22; the five sons of Draupadī tormented
Ārśyaśṛṅgī as do the five planets the moon at
the end of the Yuga (यथा युगक्षये
घोरे चन्द्रमाः पञ्चभिर् ग्रहैः) 6.
96. 36; (4) Moon by itself (i) Kaca,
coming out of the belly of his teacher, is
compared with the moon on the full moon
day on the last day of the bright fortnight
(शूक्लात्यये पौर्णमास्याम् इवेन्दुः) 1.
71. 49; (ii) The fierce fight of Droṇa and
Karṇa with the army of Yudhiṣṭhira appeared
like the one between the two oceans which
grow large due to rise of the moon (यथा
सागरयो राजंश् चन्द्रोदयविवृद्धयोः)
7. 147. 32. [For Soma also See section 1. 7]

स्या उदयः स्मृतः) 5. 109. 12.
B. Reli-
gious rites: (1) दान: Nārada told
Devakī (13. 63. 2-4) that by giving away
riches, which one cherished most, under Svāti
(स्वाताव् अथ धनं दत्त्वा यद् इष्टतमम्
आत्मनः) one obtained auspicious worlds
(लोकान् … शुभान्) after death and great
fame in this world 13. 63. 18; (2) श्राद्-
ध: Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89. 1) that
by offering a काम्य श्राद्ध under the
lunar conjunction with Svāti (स्वातियोगे)
one (was successful) deriving profit from
trade (वाणिज्यम् उपजीवति) 13. 89. 7.
C. Omen: According to one of the omens
noted hy Vyāsa before the war the harsh
planet (Ketu) was stationed between Citrā
and Svāti (चित्रास्वात्यन्तरे चैव धिष्ठि-
तः परुषो ग्रहः) 6. 3. 16.

स्वायम्भुव|स्वायंभुव
Svāyaṃbhuva nt.: Name of the first
मन्वन्तर (a long period of time) presided
over by Manu Svāyaṃbhuva.
Events: (1) Bhīṣma had heard from
his father that the eternal Nārāyaṇa, the
world-soul, was born as the son of Dharma
and had assumed four forms, viz. Nara,
Nārāyaṇa, Hari and Kṛṣṇa; this had happen-
ed formerly in the Kṛtayuga of the Svāyaṃ-
bhuva Manvantara (नारायणो हि विश्वात्मा
चतुर्मूर्तिः सनातनः।धर्मात्मजः
संबभूव पितैवं मे ऽभ्यभाषत॥
कृते युगे महाराज पुरा स्वायंभुवे
ऽन्तरे।नरो नारायणश् चैव हरिः कृष्णस्
तथैव च॥) 12. 321. 8-9 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 12. 334. 8: चतस्रो मूर्तयः नराद्याः);
(2) According to one view Rudra's throat
became blue because it was held tightly by
Nārāyaṇa in the bygone Svāyaṃbhuva
Manvantara (पूर्वे च मन्वन्तरे स्वा-
यंभुवे नारायणहस्तबन्धग्रहणान्
नीलकण्ठत्वम् एव वा) 12. 329. 15; (3)
Hari-Nārāyaṇa asked his speech-born son
Apāntaratamas (सुतो वाक्संभवो विभोः
12. 337. 38) to prepare श्रुति for making
the Vedas known; accordingly Apāntara-
tamas divided the Vedas in the Svāyaṃ-
bhuva Manvantara; when this was done the
god Hari was pleased with him (वेदाख्याने
श्रुतिः कार्या त्वया मतिमतां वर। …
तेन भिन्नास् तदा वेदा मनोः स्वायं-
भुवे ऽन्तरे।) ततस् तुतोष भगवान् हरिस्

परमा̆ल् लोकान् पुण्यकामसमन्वितान्) 13.
63. 16; (2) Yama told Śaśabindu (13. 89.
1) that by offering a काम्य श्राद्ध under
Hasta one obtained the desired fruit (हस्तेन
फलभाग् भवेत्) 13. 89. 6 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 13. 89. 6: फलभाक् इष्टार्थभाक्).
C. Simile: Droṇa standing in the arena
with the five Pāṇḍava brothers appeared like
the Moon in conjunction with the constella-
tion Sāvitra (Hasta) consisting of five stars
(पञ्चतारेण संयुक्तः सावित्रेणेव चन्द्-
रमाः) 1. 125. 30 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1.

blamed Vidura for siding with the Pāṇḍavas

to the Kāmyaka to bring Vidura back to

they returned to the Kāmyaka under instruc-
tions of Vyāsa; they were followed by learned

the Pāṇḍavas settled down there with their
counsellors and followers (ततः काम्यकम्

25), nor Sahadeva (3. 79. 29) found the
forest as beautiful as before; the divine sage
Nārada came there to meet them 3. 80. 2;
since the Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī were no
longer properly attentive (अवधानं न
गच्छामः काम्यके 3. 84. 16) and found
no delight in their continued stay in the Kām-
yaka in the absence of Arjuna, Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Dhaumya to suggest to him some other
forest rich in food and fruits 3. 84. 17, 20;
before the Pāṇḍavas left for their तीर्थयात्रा,
they lived in the Kāmyaka for three nights
with the sage Lomaśa 3. 90. 24; when Arjuna
had left the Pāṇḍavas to go to the Indraloka,
Ghaṭotkaca arrived at the Kāmyaka to help
the Pāṇḍavas to proceed to the Gandhamādana
mountain; he remained with them till Arjuna's
return 7. 158. 28 (a reference to 3. 144. 23-27);
Draupadī desired Bhīma to carry the heavenly
सौगन्धिक flower to the Kāmyaka आश्रम,
since she wanted to present it to Yudhiṣṭhira;
she would also take with her other flowers
which Bhīma might collect (हरेर् इदं मे
कामाय काम्यके पुनर् आश्रमे। … तान्य्-
अहं नेतुम् इच्छामि काम्यकं पुनर्
आश्रमम्) 3. 146. 10-11; when Arjuna came
back to the Pāṇḍavas on the Gandhamādana
mountain from the Indraloka in the company
of Indra, the latter advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
return to the hermitage Kāmyaka (स्वस्ति
प्राप्नुहि कौन्तेय काम्यकं पुनर् आश्र-
मम्) 3. 162. 12; on their way back, they
stayed at the Dvaitavana lake on the river
Sarasvatī (3. 174. 21) from where they
reached the holy Kāmyaka आश्रम full of
ascetics (ददृशुः काम्यकं पुण्यम् आश्र-
मं तापसायुतम् 3. 244. 15) and the Kām-
yaka forest where they settled down again
3. 179. 18; (काम्यकं प्राप्य कौन्तेयाः
 … निषेदुः सह कृष्णया) 3. 180. 1; a
certain Brāhmaṇa, friend of Arjuna, told the
Pāṇḍavas that Kṛṣṇa and the sage Mārkaṇ-
ḍeya would come there to visit them 3. 180.
3-6, 39; while the Pāṇḍavas were in the
Kāmyaka forest (not named) they completed

pounding it to Śaṅkara 13. 134. 13, 18-20;
(ii) Kauśikī and other rivers wait upon
Maheśvara for his bath (उपस्पर्शनहेतोस्
त्वा समीपस्था उपासते) 13. 134. 12; (iii)
Mārkaṇḍeya saw Kauśiki, among other rivers,
in the belly of Bāla (3. 186. 83, i. e. Nārā-
yaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186. 93; (iv) listed by
Mārkaṇḍeya among rivers famous as mothers
of fire-hearths, i. e. sacrifices were performed
on their banks (एता नद्यस् तु धिष्ण्यानां
मातरो याः प्रकीर्तिताः) 3. 212. 24 (For
Nī. see Kapilā); (v) on its banks there are
आश्रमस् of Viśvāmitra and Kāśyapa 3. 110,
1-2 and of Bharata 3. 82. 113; (vi) finds
mention in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151.
22, 2.
F. Holy: By waiting upon Kauśikī
(कौशिकीं तत्र सेवेत) one obtains the
fruit of a Rājasūya 3. 82. 113; by staying at
Kauśikī for a month one gets the merit of per-
forming an Aśvamedha (अश्वमेधस्य यत्
पुण्यम्) 3. 82. 124; by observing total fast
and by remaining uncovetous (वायुभक्षस्
त्व् अलोलुपः) at the gate of Kauśikī (कौशिकी-
द्वारम्) for twenty one nights one goes to
heaven 13. 26. 30; if one takes limited food
(नियताहारः) and bathes at the confluence
of the rivers Kauśikī and Dṛṣadvatī one is
freed of all sins 3. 81. 80; if one who is
controlled (यतः) and is learned (विद्वान्)
fasts for three nights and bathes at the con-
fluence of the Kauśikī and the Aruṇā he is
freed of all sins 3. 82. 135; Kauśikī is one of
those rivers by visiting which the high-souled
persons who have observed vows, go to the
Goloka (?) (ते तत्र मोदन्ति गवां विमाने
13. 105. 44) after assuming heavenly form,
wearing heavenly garlands, holy, and rich in
auspicious fragrance (दिव्यसंस्थाना दिव्य-
माल्यधराः शिवाः।प्रयान्ति पुण्यगन्-
धाढ्याः) 13. 105. 47-48.

Sarala (pine) trees (सशालस्कन्धसरल)
9. 45. 74; description of the mountain when
pierced by the शक्ति of Kārttikeya (the

Vidyādharas and the Kinnaras, living on the
peaks of the mountain, flew upwards; the
Daityas came out in the open in hundreds
and thousands and were killed by the follo-
wers of Kumāra Kārttikeya) 9. 45. 74-79;
the Krauñca mountain, though reduced to a
pitiable condition continued, to be resplendent
(शोच्याम् अपि दशां प्राप्तो रराजैव स पर्-
वतः) 9. 45. 76.
D. Mythological events:
(1) Kumāra (Kārttikeya) pierced the Krau-
ñca mountain with his arrows; through the
crevice created by the arrows swans and
vultures go to the mountain Meru (तेन
हंसाश् च गृध्राश् च मेरुं गच्छन्ति
पर्वतम्) 3. 214. 30-31; the mountain,
thus shattered, fell down issuing sounds of
excessive pain; seeing the Krauñca fall down,
other mountains howled excessively due to
fear 3. 214. 32; (2) When Kārttikeya
killed many Asuras, Bāṇa, the son of Bali,
resorted to Krauñca and started harassing
gods; when attacked by Kārttikeya, Bāṇa took
refuge with the Krauñca; then Kārttikeya
pierced Krauñca with the शक्ति given to him
by Agni 9. 45. 70, 73, 79, 81.

suing out of his body when hit by the शक्ति
of Yudhiṣṭhira, was like the Krauñca hit by
Skanda 9. 16. 50; (4) Ghaṭotkaca said to

gether with his followers (सगणः) and
his son Aśvasena lived there 1. 3. 144, 145;
1. 215. 7.
D. Agni's desire to burn the
forest: Agni approached Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna to
seek their help in fulfilling his desire to burn
the Khāṇḍava; since Indra's friend Takṣaka
lived in the forest, he foiled all Agni's ear-
lier attempts to burn it 1. 215. 1-12; 1. 223.
25; 3. 46. 40; 4. 34. 14;

Takṣaka, since he was not present at the
Khāṇḍava at the time of the burning 1. 218.
4; 1. 219. 13; (ii) His son Aśvasena was
present in the Khāṇḍava but was saved by
his mother, who swallowed him, and by

(iii) Asura Maya who sought shelter with
Arjuna when Kṛṣṇa wanted to kill him
1. 219. 35-39; (iv) Four young sons

खाण्डवं दावं मम पुत्रान् विसर्जय)
1. 220. 31-32; 20-21; 1. 223. 22; they were left
behind in the Khāṇḍava by their mother as they
did not listen to her advice to enter a mouse
hole to save themselves 1. 222. 16; actually,
at the time of the conflagration, only six were
not burnt by Agni, viz. Aśvasena, Maya, and
four Śārṅgaka birds 1. 219. 40; 1. 220. 2, 4.
I. Why was the forest burnt: Destruction
of the Khāṇḍava was ordained — this was told
to Indra by an invisible voice (वाग् उवाचा-
शरीरिणी … दिष्टं चानुपश्यैतत् खाण्डव-
स्य विनाशनम्) 1. 219. 12, 18; when Arjuna
was born an invisible voice had foretold that
Agni would burn the forest with the help of
Arjuna 1. 114. 28, 32; 8. 48. 7; but Agni is
said to have burnt the forest to make the world
free from fear (भगवान् अपि तिग्मांशुः
समिद्धं खाण्डवं वनम्।ददाह
सह कृष्णाभ्यां जनयञ् जगतो ऽभयम्)
1. 225. 5.

C. Holy:
(1) The river confers holiness on the three
worlds (गङ्गा लोकानां पुण्यदा वै त्रया-
णाम्) 13. 27. 88; (2) Bathing on conflu-
ences: (i) one who bathes at the conflu-
ence of the river Saṅgamā and the Gaṅgā gets
the fruit of performing ten Aśvamedha sacri-
fices and lifts up his family 3. 82. 31; one
who bathes at the confluence of the river
Sarasvatī and the Gaṅgā gets the fruit of
performing an Aśvamedha and goes to heaven
8. 82. 34; (ii) one who bathes at the world-
famous confluence of the Gomatī and the
Gaṅgā gets the fruit of performing an Agni-
ṣṭoma and lifts up his family 3. 82. 70; (iii)
by bathing at the confluence of the Yamunā
and the Gaṅgā one gets the merit of studying
the four Vedas and of speaking the truth
3. 83. 80; the gift given after bathing (उप-
स्पृश्य) at this confluence is better than any
other gift (दानं नान्यद् विशिष्यते) 13. 26.
34; (iv) by bathing at the confluence of
the Gaṅgā and the ocean (गङ्गायास् … साग-
रस्य च संगमे) one gets tenfold the
fruit of an Aśvamedha (अशमेधं दश-
गुणम्) 3. 83. 4; (3) Bathing in the
Gaṅgā: By bathing (कृतोदकः) in the
Bhāgīrathī at Campā and by approaching
Daṇḍārka (दण्डार्कम् अभिगम्यैव ?) one
gets the fruit of donating a thousand cows
3. 82. 142; by bathing in the second island
of the Gaṅgā (? गङ्गायास् त्व् अपरं द्वी-
पम्) and by fasting for three nights one
achieves all desires 3. 83. 5; one who observes
chastity and is composed (ब्रह्मचारी समा-
हितः) and bathes in the Gaṅgā at Śṛṅgavera-
pura is cleansed of his sins and obtains the
fruit of a Vājapeya sacrifice 3. 83. 63; by
worshipping there Mahādeva and by making
a प्रदक्षिणा one gets the position of a
Gaṇapati (गाणपत्यम् अवाप्नुयात्) 3. 83.
64; by bathing ceremonially (यो नरस् त्व्
अभिषिच्यते) at a place where the Bhāgīrathī
Gaṅgā turns northwards near the abode (?)
of Maheśvara (महेश्वरस्य निष्ठने)
and by living there for a month, abstaining
from food, one sees the deities in person
(स्वयं पश्यति देवताः) 13. 26. 14; by
going to the तीर्थ Brahmaśiras, by bathing
(कृतोदकः) in the Bhāgīrathī and by
abstaining from food for a month one goes
to the Somaloka 13. 26. 38; for the benefits
of bathing in the Gaṅgā and of resorting to it
also cf. 13. 27. 26, 29-30 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
13. 26. 31: व्युष्टिः पुण्यवृद्धिः), 32, 37-
49, 56, 59-63, 65-72, 77-86, 90, 92-95, 100;
(4) Meditating on the Gaṅgā: One who is
controlled and is respected by the learned
(प्रयतः शिष्टसंमतः) if, while leaving
his body, he thinks of the Gaṅgā he obtains
the best condition (after death) (स गतिं
परमां लभेत्) 13. 27. 69; (5) Fasting
on the Gaṅgā: One who fasts near the river
for thirteen days and eats a part of the obla-
tion in the evening of the fourteenth day, and
he does this for twelve months, he gets the
fruit of a great sacrifice and he lives in the
company of the Devakanyās for a full year
on the sandy banks of the river Jāhnavī
(चतुर्दशे तु दिवसे यः पूर्णे प्राशते
हविः।सदा द्वादशमासान् वै महामेध-
फलं लभेत्॥ … देवकन्यानिवासे च
तस्मिन् वसति मानवः।जाह्नवीवालुका-
कीर्णे पूर्णं संवत्सरं नरः) 13.
110. 60, 63; (6) Sand and earth on its
banks and the breeze coming from its waves
are holy 13. 27. 53-55. (7) Rites after
death performed at the Gaṅgā: Those
beings whose bones (गात्राणि; Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 28: गात्राणी अस्थीनि),
when thrown in the Gaṅgā come in con-
tact with its water are not thrown out of
heaven (न पुनस् तेषां त्यागः स्वर्गाद्
विधीयते) 13. 27. 27; those beings whose
obsequies (कृत्यानि) are performed with the
water of the Gaṅgā remain permanently in
the heaven (दिवि तिष्ठन्ति ते ऽचलाः) 13. 27.
28; also cf. 13. 27. 31, 36, 64; (8) The
country through which the Gaṅgā flows is as
good as a penance grove; a place along the
river Gaṅgā is to be looked upon as the place
of the Siddhas (यत्र गङ्गा महाराज स
देशस् तत् तपोवनम्।सिद्धक्षेत्रं तु
तज् ज्ञेयं गङ्गातीरसमाश्रितम्॥) 3. 83.
83; the countries (देशाः), the Janapadas, the
आश्रमस्, the mountains through which the
Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā, the best among the rivers,
flows excel in holiness (प्रकृष्टाः पुण्यतः)
13. 27. 24-25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 18:
देशाः भूमिभागाः जनपदाः महाजन-
निवासस्थानानि आश्रमाः ऋषिस्थानानि); the
countries and the quarters which do not enjoy
the benefit of the auspicious water of the
Gaṅgā are like nights without the moon and
trees without flowers 13. 27. 33; also cf.
13. 27. 34-35; (9) Many तीर्थस् on the
river Gaṅgā: (i) Daśāśvamedhika 3. 83. 82;
(ii) Brahmaśiras 13. 26. 38; (iii) Mārka-
ṇḍeyatīrtha 3. 82. 70; (iv) Aśvatīrtha 13.
4. 17; (v) Prayāga 3. 83. 69, 71; (vi)
Daṇḍārka (?) 3. 82. 142; (also see the next
section: Importance).
D. Importance:
(i) Sages and gods pay homage to Nārāyaṇa
on the river Gaṅgā 3. 88. 18; (ii) Gaṅgā
is listed by Mārkaṇḍeya among rivers famous
as mothers of fire-hearths, i. e. sacrifices were
performed on their banks (गङ्गा च … ।एता
नद्यस् तु धिष्ण्यानां मातरो याः प्रकी-
र्तिताः॥) 3. 212. 24 (for Nī. see Kapilā);
(iii) Gaṅgā, and all the Gaṅgās, listed by
Saṃjaya among rivers which are called
mothers of the universe 6. 10. 13; (सर्वा
गङ्गाश् च मारिष।विश्वस्य मातरः सर्-
वाः) 6. 10. 35; (iv) Finds place twice in
the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151. 7, 15, 2;
(v) Worlds which one gets by adoring with
faith and devotion the virtues of the Jāhnavī
were created by Gaṅgā herself (गङ्गाकृतान्
अचिरेणैव लोकान् यथेष्टम् इष्टान् विचरि-
ष्यसि त्वम्); such a person became famous
in the three worlds and achieved perfection
which was difficult to obtain 13. 27. 98-99;
(vi) The narration of the great importance
and virtues of the Gaṅgā is called a holy
Itihāsa containing the praise of the river; one
who recites it, or listens to it, is freed of all
sins (इतिहासम् इमं पुण्यं शृणुयाद् यः
पठेत वा।गङ्गायाः स्तवसंयुक्तं स
मुच्येत् सर्वकिल्बिषैः) 13. 27. 105; (vii)
Virtues of the river Gaṅgā are countless;
no one can fully describe or determine them
(वक्तुं शक्यं नेह गङ्गाजलानां गुणा-
ख्यानं परिमातुं तथैव) 13. 27. 97,
96; (viii) Gaṅgā offered shelter, protection,
support to those who are without it 13. 27. 44;
Lomaśa invoked the blessings of the Gaṅgā,
besides those of Varuṇa, Yama, and the
Yamunā, on Yudhiṣṭhira and requested her
to protect him from the mountains which he
was about to enter while on his way to the
Gandhamādana 3. 140. 13-14; (ix) Grief
due to separation from the Gaṅgā more
unbearable than from near relatives or wealth;
on the other hand, just the sight of the Gaṅgā
is more pleasing than that of the desired
objects or sons 13. 27. 74-76; (x) Gaṅgā
offers sustenance to those who depend on her
13. 27. 51-52; (11) Relationship with other
rivers: (i) Tripathagā Gaṅgā looked upon as
the first to be created among the rivers (तथा
त्रिपथगा गङ्गा नदीनाम् अग्रजा स्मृता)
14. 44. 13; (ii) among the Vibhūtis of the
Bhagavān, Jāhnavī is said to be the best
among the rivers (स्रोतसाम् अस्मि जाह्नवी)
6. 32. 31; also cf. 13. 27. 50; (iii) the Gaṅgā
has the same relationship to other rivers as
the sun has to other luminaries (?) in the sky,
the moon to the manes, and the king (?) to
men (दिवि ज्योतिर् यथादित्यः पितॄणां चैव
चन्द्रमाः।देवेशश् च यथा नॄणां
गङ्गेह सरितां तथा॥) 13. 27. 73 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 74: दिवि देवानाम् इति
शेषः।देवेशः राजेन्द्रः); (12) Service
to deities: Gaṅgā is mentioned among those
rivers who wait on Śiva for his ablutions
(उपस्पर्शनहेतोस् त्वा समीपस्था उपा-
सते) 13. 134. 12, 17; the Bhāgīrathī is one
of the rivers who wait upon Varuṇa in his
सभा 2. 9. 17; (13) Limitation: Bhagī-
ratha told Brahmadeva that his stay even for
a hundred years on the bank of the Jāhnavī,
practising austerities and giving as gift a
thousand mules and a host of maidens (अदां
च तत्राश्वतरीसहस्रं नारीपुरम्) was
not enough to take him to the Brahmaloka
which was beyond the world of the gods, the
cows and the sages 13. 106. 10, 5.
E. Epic
events related to the Gaṅgā: (1) Marriage
with Saṃtanu and birth of Bhīṣma: King
Pratīpa once went to the bank of the Gaṅgā
(गङ्गातीरगतः) and sat down for many years
muttering prayers (जपन्) 1. 92. 1; Gaṅgā,
in the form of a beautiful woman, rose from
the waters and sat on the right thigh of king
Pratīpa 1. 92. 2-3; when asked by the king
what he might do to please her she requested
him to make love with her (त्वाम् अहं
कामये राजन् कुरुश्रेष्ठ भजस्व माम्)
1. 92. 4-5; but, at the king's suggestion,
she agreed to be his daughter-in-law and
disappeared 1. 92. 9-12, 15-16; she laid
down the condition that the king's son (her
future husband) should not know her identity
and should never question the propriety of her
actions (स मे नाभिजनज्ञः स्याद् आचरे-
यं च यद् विभो।तत् सर्वम् एव पुत्रस्
ते न मीमांसेत कर्हिचित्) 1. 92. 13-14;
king Śāṃtanu, son of Pratīpa, once went for
hunting on the bank of the Gaṅgā; the river
appeared before him in the form of a beautiful
woman 1. 92. 25-26; when Śaṃtanu requested
her to be his wife she agreed on condition that
he did not prevent her from doing anything,
auspicious or otherwise (शुभं वा यदि
वाशुभम्); should the king question her,
she would abandon him 1. 92. 31-35; when
the king consented, she, full of lustre, attended
on him as his wife 1. 92. 39-40; Gaṅgā, as
the wife of Śaṃtanu, gave birth to eight sons
seven of whom, as soon as they were born,
she threw away in the waters of the river
Gaṅgā; the king did not object to her on the
first seven occasions, but on the eighth occa-
sion he asked her to spare him a son; he
also wanted to know who she really was
1. 92. 44-47; when thus questioned, she told
Śaṃtanu that she was the river Gaṅgā, the
daughter of Jahnu, and that she lived with
him to achieve some purpose of the gods
(देवकार्यार्थसिद्ध्यर्थम् 1. 92. 49); the
eight sons she bore him were the eight Vasus
who were born as human beings due to the
curse of Vasiṣtha; she had promised the
Vasus that she would release them from their
human birth as soon as they were born
(cf. 1. 93. 40); she blessed the king before
her departure (स्वस्ति ते ऽस्तु गमिष्यामि); she
told the king that she had lived with the Vasus
(while they were in her womb) in succession
(एष पर्यायवासो मे वसूनां संनिधौ
कृतः) and that the eighth son who was to be
given to him later by her was the one born of
her (Gaṅgā) (मत्प्रसूतं विजानीहि गङ्गा-
दत्तम् इमं सुतम्) 1. 92. 48-55; Śaṃtanu
asked Jāhnavī who was Āpava (Vasiṣṭha)
and what fault the Vasus had committed to
invite the curse of Vasiṣṭha; he also asked
why the eighth son (Gaṅgādatta) was requir-
ed to live long among human beings 1. 9. 1-3;
Gaṅgā Jāhnavī then told the king the whole
story 1. 93. 5-42; Gaṅgā then disappeared
taking the last-born son with her 1. 93. 43;
many years later, King Śaṃtanu, while once
hunting along the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī,
noticed that the river had little water (अल्प-
जलाम् 1. 94. 21) and was not flowing as before
(स्यन्दते किं न्व् इयं नाद्य 1. 94. 22);
trying to find out the cause of it the king
saw a young boy who had covered waters of
the entire Gaṅgā with his arrows 1. 94. 24-25;
Śaṃtanu suspected the boy to be his son and
hence asked Gaṅgā to show herself to him;
Gaṅgā appeared before the king holding the
boy in her right hand, but the king did not
immediately recognize her; Gaṅgā handed
over the son to the king 1. 94. 28-31, 36;
Śaṃtanu's marriage with Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī
and the birth of Devavrata by her mentioned
in 1. 57. 76; 1. 90. 50; 5. 179. 5; 12. 38. 8;
12. 46. 15; the birth of the Vasus from Bhāgī-
rathī in the house of Śaṃtanu mentioned
in 1. 2. 78; 1. 61. 68; (2) Her role in
Bhīṣma's fight with Rāma Jāmadagnya:
When the fight between Bhīṣma and Rāma
Jāmadagnya was imminent, the latter threa-
tened to kill Bhīṣma so that Jāhnavī might
see him lying on the bed of arrows and the
daughter of Bhagīratha (Gaṅgā), who
gave birth to him, might weep seeing him
dead 5. 179. 3-5; when Bhīṣma was ready
to fight with Rāma, his mother appeared be-
fore him in her original form (स्वरूपिणी)
to try to dissuade Bhīṣma from the fight, and
expressed her readiness to go to Jāmadagnya
to beg him not to engage Bhīṣma, who was
his pupil, in fight; Bhīṣma then told her the
incidents which had led to the fight; then the
river (Gaṅgā) went to Rāma to dissuade
him; when told that it was Bhīṣma who was
to be dissuaded, Gaṅgā returned to Bhīṣma
and again pleaded with him; but Bhīṣma,
angered, did not agree to her request 5. 179.
22-30; Bhāgīrathī again appeared later in
this event when she joined the sages, Nārada
and others, who stood between Bhīṣma and
Rāma to stop them fighting with each other
5. 186. 27; (3) Her pleading with Ambā:
Gaṅgā, the mother of Bhīṣma, rose from the
waters and asked Ambā the purpose she
wanted to achieve by performing the auste-
rities; when told by Ambā that her effort was
aimed at the destruction of Bhīṣma, Gaṅgā
(सागरगा) told her that her purpose was
crooked (जिह्मं चरसि भामिनि); if she
persisted in observing her vows and if she
died during the observance of the vows she
would become a crooked river having water
only during the rainy season and not in the
remaining eight months (नदी भविष्यसि
शुभे कुटिला वार्षिकोदका। … वार्षिकी नाष्ट-
मासिकी); Bhīsma's mother then returned from
the place where Ambā practised austerities
6. 187. 29-36; (4) Death of Bhīṣma: When
Bhīṣma, after his fall on the battle-field,
resolved to hold his life till the start of the
Uttarāyaṇa, Gaṅgā, knowing his resolve,
sent to him the great sages in the form of
swans 6. 114. 90; much later, after the
cremation of Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the
rest, including Vyāsa, Nārada, Asita and
Kṛṣṇa, went to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
and all the Kṣatriya warriors and citizens
offered water offerings to him; then Bhāgīrathī
arose from water and, crying, lamented the
death of her son; she addressed her words to
the Kauravas praising and recounting the good
qualities of Bhīṣma 13. 154. 17-26; the
grieved Bhāgīrathī was consoled by Dāmo-
dara (Kṛṣṇa) assuring her that her son was
brought down from the chariot by Arjuna
and not by Śikhaṇḍin and that he had return-
ed to the Vasus in heaven 13. 154. 27-32;
Bhāgīrathī then gave up grief and entered
her own waters; Kṛṣṇa and others, after
honouring the river (सत्कृत्य ते तां सरितम्)
returned from that place (to Hāstinapura)
when permitted by her to do so (अनुज्ञातास्
तया) 13. 154. 33-34; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had
offered water offerings to Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira
came out of water with Dhṛtarāṣṭra and,
grief-stricken, fell on the bank of the Gaṅgā
14. 1. 1-2; (5) Arjuna punished for his role
in the fall of Bhīṣma: Ulūpī told Arjuna
that his defeat at the hands of his son Babhru-
vāhana was an expiation (निष्कृतिः) he had
to undergo for the अधर्म committed by him
in bringing about the fall of Bhīṣma 14. 82. 8;
this expiation was prescribed by the Vasus
and the Gaṅgā (एषा तु विहिता शान्तिः पुत्राद्
यां प्राप्तवान् असि।वसुभिर् वसुधापाल
गङ्गया च महामते) 14. 82. 11; when
Bhīṣma died (हते शान्तनवे नृपे) the
Vasus emerged from waters and meeting the
great river, told her that they wanted to
curse Arjuna for his misdeed in the war, to
which Bhāgīrathī agreed (इदम् ऊचुर् वचो
घोरं भागीरथ्या मते तदा॥ … वयम्
अप्य् अर्जुनं … शापेन योजयामेति तथास्त्व्
इति चाब्रवीत्॥) 14. 82. 12-15; (6) The
Pāṇḍavas came across the Gaṅgā at various
places: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira and his bro-
thers decided to go on a pilgrimage, the
Brāhmaṇas expressed their wish to visit with
them the Gaṅgā and other rivers 3. 91. 10;
when they arrived at Prayāga at the con-
fluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā the
Pāṇḍavas bathed in their waters (आप्लुत्य
गात्राणि), practised the severest austerities
and gave gifts to the Brāhmaṇas 3. 93. 5-6;
(ii) They again arrived at the Bhāgīrathī
flowing by the side of the Agastyāśrama
where Lomaśa advised them to bathe at
will (यथेष्टम् अवगाह्यताम्) 3. 97. 27;
(iii) Going further from the river Kauśikī,
they arrived at the place where the Gaṅgā
met the ocean and bathed there in waters
of five hundred rivers (नदीशतानां पञ्चा-
नां मध्ये चक्रे समाप्लवम्) 3. 114. 2;
(iv) On reaching the vicinity of the Maināka
mountain, Lomaśa showed the river Gaṅgā
to Yudhiṣṭhira; he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
bathe in the Gaṅgā to be freed of all sins;
he also advised him to bathe silently (तूष्णीं
गङ्गाम् … समुपस्पृश) 3. 135. 5-7; (v)
When the Pāṇḍavas had crossed the Uśīra-
bīja, the Maināka, the Śvetagiri and the
Kālaśaila mountains, Lomaśa showed them
the Gaṅgā flowing in seven currents (एषा
गङ्गा सप्तविधा) 3. 140. 1-2; Lomaśa
could hear the sound of the Gaṅgā on the
top on the mountain Jāmbūnada 3. 140. 14;
(vi) The Pāṇḍavas saw the Bhāgīrathī on
the Kailāsa mountain; they lived there giving
offerings to gods and manes again and again
3. 145. 37, 40, 42; (7) Some events after
the war and the funeral rites offered to the
dead: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira went to meet
Dhṛtarāṣṭra who had left Hāstinapura, he
saw the Kaurava women lamenting on the
bank of the Gaṅgā 11. 11. 5; (ii) Vyāsa,
who knew that Gāndhārī would curse the
Pāṇḍavas in their first meeting with her after
the war, hastened to them after bathing (उप-
स्पृश्य) in the Gaṅgā 11. 13. 4; (iii) After
lifting the funeral pyre of Droṇa, his pupils,
keeping Kṛpī in the front, proceeded to the
Gaṅgā 11. 23. 42; (iv) After arranging
for the cremation of all the heroes who fell
in the war, Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, went towards the Gaṅgā 11.
26. 44; on reaching the Gaṅgā, Yudhiṣṭhira
and the Kaurava women offered water offerings
to the departed (प्रचक्रुः सलिलक्रियाः);
at that moment the Gaṅgā became easily
fordable spreading herself out widely (सूप-
तीर्थाभवद् गङ्गा भूयो विप्रससार च);
the bank of the Gaṅgā then was without
joy and merriment (निरानन्दम् अनुत्सवम्
 … गङ्गातीरम् अशोभत) 11. 27. 1-5; (v)
Yudhisṭhira, after giving water offerings to
Karṇa (चकारास्योदकं प्रभुः 11. 27.
21) and after performing the funeral rites for
him with the wives of Karṇa, came out of
the river Gaṅgā (स ताभिः सह धर्मात्मा
प्रेतकृत्यम् अनन्तरम् कृत्व्ōत्ततार गङ्गा-
याः) 11. 27. 24; (vi) When the Pāṇḍavas,
who had given water offerings, were still
on the Bhāgīrathī, Dvaipāyana, Narada
and others and their pupils and hundreds
of thousands of other Brāhmaṇas gathered
there to console Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 1. 1-2,
4-5, 8; (8) Cremation of Pāṇḍu and
Mādrī: The cremation was performed on
an auspicious and even spot in the forest on
the river Gaṅgā (रमणीये वनोद्देशे
गङ्गातीरे समे शुभे); the bier (शिबिका)
in which their dead bodies were brought from
Hāstinapura were placed on this spot 1. 118.
16-17; (9) Certain other epic events in
which the Gaṅgā is referred to: (i) At
Pramāṇakoṭi, Duryodhana tied up Bhīma,
while he was asleep, and threw him in the
waters of the Gaṅgā 1. 55. 10; 3. 13. 74;
(ii) Droṇa with his pupils once went to the
Gaṅgā for bathing when a crocodile caught
him by his ankle (जङ्घान्ते) 1. 123. 69;
(iii) When Drupada was brought captive by
his pupils to Droṇa, the latter told Drupada
that in future he (Drupada) would rule over
the Pañcāla country which lay to the south
of the Bhāgīrathī while he (Droṇa) himself
would rule over the part of the country which
lay to its north; Drupada then established
himself in the capital city of Kampilya in the
countryside of Mākandī on the river Gaṅgā
ruling the southern Pāñcālas as far as the
river Carmaṇvatī 1. 128. 12, 15; 1. 154. 24;
(iv) Drupada while reaming along the bank
of the Gāṅgā, came across a settlement of the
Brāhmaṇas (ब्राह्मणावसथ) 1. 155. 5;
(v) The Aṅgāraparṇa episode: The Pāṇḍa-
vas on their way to the Pañcālas reached the
Somaśravāyaṇa तीर्थ on the river Gaṅgā;
Aṅgāraparṇa, king of the Gandharvas, had
already arrived there to sport with his wives
in the waters of the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī;
he was angered when he heard the voice of
the Pāṇḍavas approaching the river; he told
the Pāṇḍavas to leave the place as the forest
along the rivers Gaṅgā and Vākā belonged
to him; Arjuna questioned the sole right of
the Gandharva over the river either at night,
or by day, or in twilight (नद्याम् अस्याम्
 … कस्य कॢप्तः परिग्रहः 1. 158. 15);
it was therefore not proper for the Gan-
dharva to withhold the river from others
since that was against the age old custom
(कथम् इच्छसि तां रोद्धुं नैष धर्-
मः सनातनः 1. 158. 20); why should the
Pāṇḍavas be restrained from touching the
waters of the Bhāgīrathī 1. 158. 2, 4, 5, 11,
13, 15, 20, 21; defeat of Aṅgāraparṇa in
this episode alluded to in 1. 2. 86; later the
Gandharva and the Pāṇḍavas took leave of
each other on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
1. 174. 5; (vi) Arjuna, during the period
of his exile, entered the river Gaṅgā for
bathing; as he wanted to come out of the
water he was dragged by Ulūpī in the water
of that river 1. 206. 11-13; (vii) Arjuna,
during his exile, while going to the east,
crossed many rivers one of them being the
Gaṅgā 1. 207. 5-6; (viii) Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma
and Arjuna crossed the rivers Mālā, Carmaṇ-
vatī and Gaṅgā on their way to the Magadha
2. 18. 21; (ix) On account of the cries of
thousands of animals that were burnt at the
Khāṇḍava forest the fish in the waters (?)
of the Gaṅgā were terrified 1. 219. 28
(तेन शब्देन वित्रेसुर् गङ्गोदधिचरा
झषाः; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 228. 32: गङ्गो-
दोधिचरा इति अतिदूरस्थोपलक्षणम्); (x)
The Pāṇḍavas spent their first night of forest
life under a banyan tree called Pramāṇa on
the river Jāhnavī; they bathed in it and had
only the water of the Jāhnavī to drink for
the night 3. 1. 39-40; from the bank of the
river Jāhnavī they started towards the Kuru-
kṣetra 3. 6. 1; (xi) On the mountain
Himavant Arjuna took bath in the Gaṅgā
before ascending Indra's chariot to go to the
Indraloka 3. 43. 20; (xii) Bhīṣma once
lived as a मुनि on the bank of the river
Bhāgīrathī practising the vow taken by his
father (पित्र्यं व्रतम्); there he heard
from Pulastya the fruit obtained by visiting
the तीर्थस् 3. 80. 11-12; there, on the bank
of the Gaṅgā, he also heard the narrative of
Vipula from Mārkaṇḍeya 13. 43. 17; (xiii)
When the Pāṇḍavas were near the Gandha-
mādana mountain (3. 155. 34) Yudhiṣṭhira
showed to Bhīma the river Mahāgaṅgā 3.
155. 69, 85; (xiv) The basket (मञ्जूषा)
containing the newly born Karṇa went down
from the river Aśvanadī to the Gaṅgā (via
the Carmaṇvatī and the Yamunā) and then
to the city of Campā 3. 292. 25-26; when
the Sūta Adhiratha went with his wife to the
Jāhnavī, she saw there by chance the floating
basket brought to the bank by the waves of
the Jāhnavī 3. 293. 1, 3; (xv) The army of
the Kauravas, collected for the war, spread
along the bank of the Gaṅgā 5. 19. 30;
(xvi) Kuntī, who wished to approach Karṇa
to tell him the truth about his birth, went
to the Bhāgīrathī to meet him; there on the
bank of the Gaṅgā she heard the sound of
the prayers recited by Karṇa 5. 142. 26-27;
(xvii) Arjuna wishing to propitiate Śiva
to seek his help in fulfilling the vow to kill
Jayadratha saw the Gaṅgā on his way 7. 57.
24; (xviii) Bhīma, in search of Aśva-
tthāman, reached the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
where he saw Vyāsa and the other sages seated
on the bank (उदकान्ते) 10. 13. 12-13;
(xix) After the great war, Kṛpa, Aśvatthā-
man and Kṛtavarman, after their meeting
with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, rode fast on horse-back to-
wards the Gaṅgā 11. 10. 19; (xx) Bhīṣma,
having narrated to Yudhiṣṭhira the Itihāsa
connected with the praise of the Gaṅgā
(इतिहासं … गङ्गायाः स्तवसंयुतम्), ad-
vised him to approach the Gaṅgā with great
devotion in order to obtain the highest per-
fection (सिद्धिम् उत्तमाम्); he and his
brothers were delighted to hear this Itihāsa
of the Gaṅgā from Bhīṣma 13. 27. 103-104;
(xxi) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to retire to
the forest he, along with Gāndhārī, Kuntī,
Vidura and Saṃjaya, went in a day a long
distance from Hastinapura and camped on
the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; next morning
they started from there towards the north
15. 24. 16, 23; after going some distance they
again camped on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;
in the evening he and Gāndhārī went to the
Gaṅgā and performed the prescribed puri-
ficatory rites (चकार विधिवच् छौचम्);
Vidura and other men performed individually
all the necessary rites (चक्रुः सर्वाः क्रियास्
तत्र पुरुषा विदुरादयः) after bathing in
the various तीर्थस् (तीर्थेष्व् आप्लुत्य); when
the purificatory rites were over Kuntī led
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the bank of the
Gaṅgā; there the priests of the king laid a
Vedī (कृतो वेदीपरिस्तरः) on which Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra gave offerings in the fire; from the
bank of the Bhāgīrathī they all proceeded to
the Kurukṣetra 15. 25. 1, 4-8; (10) Meet-
ing with the dead: Vyāsa asked Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and all those staying with him to go to the
bank of the Bhāgīrathī to meet all those
who fell in the war; accordingly all of them
went to the Gaṅgā and resided there 15. 39.
18-22; then in the evening Vyāsa bathed in
the Bhāgīrathī and invoked all those who
fought on the side of the Pāṇḍavas and the
Kauravas; at his call, all the kings, Bhīṣma,
Droṇa, and the rest, together with their armies,
rose in thousands from the water (of the
Bhāgīrathī) 15. 40. 4, 7, 13; after some time,
at the instance of Vyāsa, they again dis-
appeared plunging into the river Tripathagā
(Gaṅgā) and repaired to their respective
places; then Vyāsa, standing in the water
(of the Tripathagā), told the Kaurava women
that those who wished to obtain the worlds
of their respective deceased husbands should
quickly enter the water of the Jāhnavī; the
women, fully believing the words of Vyāsa,
took permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and entered
the water of the Jāhnavī; freed of their bodies
they were united with their husbands and
acquired the worlds of their husbands 15.
41. 13, 17-21; (11) End of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī and Kuntī: When Nārada arrived
at Hāstinapura to meet Yudhiṣṭhira he paid
a visit to the Gaṅgā on his way; people
residing near the Gaṅgā had told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was engaged in
severe austerities; Yudhiṣṭhira therefore
asked Nārada if he had met Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and the rest during his visit to the Gaṅgā
and how they fared; Nārada told him that
after their last meeting with Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
latter had repaired to the Gaṅgādvāra; once,
after his bath in the Gaṅgā, when Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra had started for his hermitage, wind
arose, fire engulfed the forest, and burnt it
(गङ्गायाम् आप्लुतो धीमान् आशृअमाभिमुखो
ऽभवत् 15. 45. 18); Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī were burnt in the fire; only Saṃ-
jaya escaped from the forest fire and was
seen, surrounded by ascetics, by Nārada
on the bank of the Gaṅgā 15. 45. 5-6, 10,
29-32; Nārada further informed Yudhiṣṭhira
that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was burnt on the bank of
the Jāhnavī not by the ordinary fire but by
the sacred fire which Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself
and his priests had left after performing the
rites (i. e. the forest fire was caused by the
sacred fire left by Dhṛtarāṣṭra) (नासौ वृथा-
ग्निना दग्धो यथा तत्र श्रुतं मया);
this was reported to Nārada by the sages
whom he met on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
15. 47. 1-6; when asked by Nārada to give
the water offerings to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī (कर्तुम् अर्हसि कौन्तेय तेषां
त्वम् उदकक्रियाम्), Yudhiṣṭhira went to the
Gaṅgā with his brothers and wife; there,
going into the water, they all offered water
(ददुस् तोयम्) and stayed outside the city
to undergo purification (शौचं निवर्तय-
न्तः) 15. 47. 9-13; (12) Ulūpī entered the
Gaṅgā when, at the end, the Pāṇḍavas and
Draupadī started for the forest 17. 1. 25;
F. Past and mythological events in which
the river Gaṅgā figures: (1) Past events:
(i) Bhagīratha brought her down from the
heaven: The sage Kapila had told Aṃśu-
mant, the grandson of Sagara, that his
grandson will bring down the Tripathagā
from the heaven by propitiating Maheśvara
for the purification of the burnt sons of
Sagara 3. 107. 27; however, the descent of
the Gaṅgā from the heaven was first attem-
pted by Dilīpa, father of Bhagīratha, with-
out success 3. 106. 38; Bhagīratha, desirous
of seeking the favour of the Gaṅgā, went
to the Himavant to practise austerities 3.
107. 4; after one thousand years the Gaṅgā
appeared before Bhagīratha in a bodily form
3. 107. 14; when requested by Bhagīratha to
wash the bones (शरीराणि) of the sons of
Sagara so that they might go to heaven,
she agreed, but first asked Bhagīratha to
propitiate Śiva by तपस् so that he might
agree to hold her on his head; no one else
could check her speed when she descended from
heaven; Bhagīratha succeeded in securing a
boon from Śaṅkara to hold the Gaṅgā 3.
107. 18-25; Śiva assured Bhagīratha to
hold the Devanadī (Gaṅgā) when she came
down from heaven; Śiva then went to the
Himavant and asked Bhagīratha to request
the daughter of the king of the mountains
(Gaṅgā not directly named) to come down
from the heaven; when Bhagīratha thought
of the Gaṅgā (गङ्गां समनुचिन्तयत्
3. 108. 5), the river descended from heaven
on Śiva's forehead; the river became triple
while flowing thence to the ocean (सा ब-
भूव विसर्पन्ती त्रिधा राजन् समुद्रगा
3. 108. 10); the river asked Bhagīratha to
show her the way; Bhagīratha led her to the
place where lay the bones (शरीऋआणि) of the
sons of Sagara; after holding the Gaṅgā on
his head Hara went to the Kailāsa; Bhagī-
ratha having reached the ocean with the
Gaṅgā filled it with the water of the river;
Bhagīratha made Gaṅgā his daughter (दुहि-
तृत्वे च नृपतिर् गङ्गां समनुकल्पयत्);
he offered water of the Gaṅgā to the manes
3. 108. 17; 12. 29. 62; Lomaśa thus told
Yudhiṣṭhira how the Gaṅgā came to be Tri-
pathagā (flowing in three regions-heaven,
mid-region, and the earth) and how she was
made to descend also to fill the ocean with
water (पूरणार्थं समुद्रस्य पृथिवीम्
अवतारिता) 3. 108. 2-18; the incident of the
descent of the Gaṅgā on the head of Śiva also
alluded to in 5. 109. 6; 6. 7. 28; 13. 27. 71, 87,
89, 95; 13. 106. 26; 13. 134. 17; (ii) Other
events related to Bhagīratha and the Gaṅgā:
(a) Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī formerly sat on the
lap of Bhagīratha while he was seated on the
slope (near the river), hence she came to
be known as Urvaśī (उपह्वरे निवसतो
यस्याङ्के निषसाद ह।गङ्गा भागीऋअथी
तस्माद् उर्वशी ह्य् अभवत् पुरा 12. 29. 61
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 29. 68: उर्वशी ऊरौ
वासो यस्याः सा इति योगात्।ऊर्वसीत्य् अपेक्षिते
ह्रस्वत्वं वर्णविपर्यश् च पृषोदरादि-
त्वात् ज्ञेयः); (b) From the lake Bindu-
saras Bhagīratha watched Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā
and lived there for many years 2. 3. 9; 6.
7. 41; (c) Bhagīratha gave on the Gaṅgā
a myriad of hundreds of cows (गवां
शतानाम् अयुतम्) 13. 106. 37; he gave
gifts (of cows ?) which would cover the
entire current of the Gaṅgā (स्रोतश् च
यावद् गङ्गायाश् छन्नम् आसीज् जगत्पते।
दक्षिणाभिः प्रवृत्ताभिः) 13. 106. 24;
(iii) Jahnu and the Gaṅgā: The Gaṅgā
became the daughter of Jahnu (दुहितृत्वम्
अनुप्राप्ता गङ्गा यस्य (i. e. जह्नोः))
13. 4. 3; Jahnu waited on her (जह्नुर्
जाह्नविसेविता) 13. 151. 44; (iv) King
Yayāti, desirous of arranging a Svayaṃvara
for his daughter Mādhavī, went to a hermitage
situated on the confluence of the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; his sons Pūru and Yadu put
their sister on a chariot and rushed to the
same hermitage 5. 118. 1-2; the entire region
between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā in the
middle of the earth was given by Yayāti to
his son Pūru as his kingdom (गङ्गायमु-
नयोर् मध्ये कृत्स्नो ऽयं विषियस् तव।
मध्ये पृथिव्यास् त्वं राजा) 1. 82. 5;
(v) A battle was fought between Haryaśva
and the Haihayas, the kinsmen of Vītahavya,
in the region lying between the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; in this battle Haryaśva was
killed 13. 31. 11; Divodāsa, son of Sudeva,
established Vārāṇasī on the north bank of the
Gaṅgā and to the south of Gomatī (to avoid
the attack by the Haihayas) 13. 31. 18, 16;
when, later, Pratardana, the son of Divodāsa,
wanted to attack the Vaitahavyas (= Hai-
hayas) he crossed the river Gaṅgā 13. 31. 35;
(vi) On the river Gaṅgā, near Kanyakubja,
king Gādhi married his daughter Satyavatī to
Ṛcīka Bhārgava 3. 115. 17; (vii) The sage
Cyavana Bhārgava once took the vow of
staying in water for twelve years (उदवास-
कृतारम्भो बभूव सुमहाव्रतः … वर्-
षाणि द्वादश मुनिर् जलवासे धृतव्रतः)
13. 50. 3-4; he became stiff like a post
(स्थाणुभूतः) and after worshipping the
deities entered the waters of the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; he withstood with his head the
terrific current of the two rivers; the two
rivers, and those which followed them, made
a प्रदक्षिणा of the sage and did not cause
harm to him; the sage slept in the waters like
a log of wood and then stood erect (अन्तर्
जले स सुष्वाप काष्ठभूतो महामुनिः।
ततश् चोर्ध्वस्थितो धीमान् अभवद् भर-
तर्षभ) 13. 50. 6-9; (viii) Sage Cyavana
took his residence for some time on the bank of
the river Gaṅgā to observe a व्रत 13. 53. 55;
(ix) At a place not far from Kanyakubja
on the bank of the Gaṅgā is the Aśvatīrtha
where from the waters of the Gaṅgā arose
a thousand horses having one black ear;
Ṛcīka, the son of Cyavana, got them by
the favour of Varuṇa 13. 4. 16-17; (x)
A certain Brāhmaṇa once lived in the city
Mahāpadma on the southern bank of the
Gaṅgā 12. 341. 1; (xi) When Śuka was
born on the mountain Meru (मेरुपृष्ठे),
Gaṅgā in her original form (स्वरूपिणी)
arrived there to bathe him 12. 311. 12;
(xii) Once, Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin, the young son
of Sṛñjaya, accompanied by his nurse, ran
while playing on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;
he was then attacked by Indra's वज्र in
the form of a tiger 12. 31. 31; (xiii) Gau-
tama and his brothers put their eldest brother
Dīrghatamas in a wooden box and put it on
the Gaṅgā; king Bali, who had gone to bathe
in the river Gaṅgā (not named), saw the box
brought to him by the current of the water
1. 98. 18, 21; (xiv) When the Kṣatriyas
were destroyed by Rāma Jāmadagnya, Aṅga,
the son of Diviratha, was protected by Gau-
tama on the bank of the Gaṅgā 12. 49. 72;
(xv) Bharata, the son of Duḥṣanta, offered
on different rivers a thousand horse-sacrifices
of which he bound fourteen horses on the river
Gaṅgā (यो बद्ध्वा … अश्वान् देवेभ्यो …
गङ्गाम् अनु चतुर्दश॥अश्वमेधसह-
स्रेण … इष्टवान् स महातेजा दौःषन्तिर्
भरतः पुरा॥) 12. 29. 41-42; (xvi)
Bharadvāja, when he went to the Gaṅgā for
bath, saw there the Apsaras Ghṛtācī who
had also come there to bathe 1. 154. 2;
(xvii) Vasiṣṭha turned the Gaṅgā, proceed-
ing towards the Kailāsa, to the Mānasa lake;
when that lake got mixed with the river,
the Gaṅgā became the Sarayū 13. 140. 23-24;
(xviii) Rājadharman, the son of Kaśyapa
and Dākṣāyaṇī, offered to Gautama, his guest,
large fishes (महामीनाः) obtained from the
regions through which the river Gaṅgā flew
12. 164. 4; (xix) A certain Brāhmaṇa,
Kauśika by name, told the truth to the robbers
about the whereabouts of the people who
were afraid of them; by this act he incurred
sin on the river Gaṅgā 12. 110. 8 (reference
to 8. 49. 41-46 where in st. 32 Gaṅgā is
not named); (xx) The following persons
attained perfection (सिद्धि) on the Gaṅgā:
(1) Śilavṛtti, when instructed by Siddha on
the virtues of the Tripathā, worshipped the
Gaṅgā according to the rites and attained
perfection which was very difficult to attain;
Siddha himself, after instructing Śilarati,
entered the sky 13. 27. 101-102; (2) Sage
Sanatkumāra attained great perfection on the
Gaṅgā 3. 135. 6; (xxi) Indra, in the form
of a very weak Brāhmaṇa, appeared before
Yavakrī and started doing an impossible
deed viz. constructing a dam in the Bhāgī-
rathī by filling the Gaṅgā with sand; he
poured constantly handfuls of sand in the
Bhāgīrathī; when asked by Yavakrī smilingly
why he was busy with this fruitless effort
Indra told him that he wanted to construct
a dam in the Gaṅgā so that the river can be
crossed easily 3. 135. 30-36; (2) Mytho-
logical: (i) Gaṅgā once went to pay a
visit to Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) in his as-
sembly; there her garment was displaced by
the wind; King Mahābhiṣa, who happened to
be there, constantly looked at her in that
condition; he was therefore cursed to be born
again as a human being; Gaṅgā returned
from the assembly continuing to think about
Mahābhīṣa; she saw the Vasus, dejected,
going along the way; she asked them the
cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her
that they were cursed by Vasiṣṭha to be born
as humans; they requested Gaṅgā to assume
a human form so that she could give birth
to them as humans; Gaṅgā agreed and asked
them whom would they like to be their father;
they chose Śaṃtanu, the son of Pratīpa;
Gaṅgā also had thought of the same person,
hence she would do what was dear to the king
and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gaṅgā to
throw them into water no sooner they were
born; Gaṅgā agreed to even that request,
but asked them to spare one of them so that
Śaṃtanu's union with her would not be totally
fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each
one of them contributing one-eighth share for
Gaṅgā's son; and they also told her that the
son of the Gaṅgā would beget no son; having
come to this agreement with the Gaṅgā
the Vasus, delighted, went their way 1. 91.
4-22; (ii) The lustre (तेजः 13. 84. 11)
of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget
through that lustre a son on the Gaṅgā for
killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went
to the Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and became mixed
with her; as a result, Gaṅgā became pregnant;
Gaṅgā could not bear the embryo, was men-
tally distressed, and was in great agony;
when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the
Gaṅgā, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely;
terrified, the Gaṅgā was unable to bear the
embryo; Jāhnavī, with her body covered with
lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could
not contain his lustre within her; she was
very much uneasy and was agitated; she
would like to cast away the embryo, as she
could hold it no longer, and not because of
her sweet will; she was no longer her usual
self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the
embryo within her: as she was capable of
bearing and containing the whole earth there
was nothing which Gaṅgā could not achieve
except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni;
in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the
other gods the Gaṅgā cast off the embryo on
mount Meru; Gaṅgā was capable of holding
an embryo, but she could not do it on this
occasion as she was overcome by the lustre
of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared
before Agni who asked her if the delivery
was happy (कच्चिद् गर्भः सुखोदयः);
he asked her to describe to him the colour,
the form and the lustre of the child; having
described to Agni the form of his son the god-
dess (देवी) Gaṅgā disappeared 13. 84. 8, 12,
52-72; 9. 43 8-9 (where the embryo is said
to have been cast off on the mountain Hima-
vant; when the embryo was cast off that part
of the mountain became of gold 9. 43. 14);
the son Kumāra was first Gāṅgeya (son of
Gaṅgā), then became Kārttikeya (the son of
the Kṛttikās); the Gaṅgā, the best among the
rivers, waited on him 9. 43. 20; when the
child approached Śiva, Pārvatī, Gaṅgā and
Pāvaka (Agni) each one of them wondered
whom he would show his honour by going to
him or her first (किं नु पूर्वम् अयं
बालो गौरवाद् अभ्युपैष्यति।अपि माम् इति
सर्वेषाम् तेषाम् आसीद् मनोगतम्) 9. 43.
34-35; knowing their mind the child assumed
four forms (ततो ऽभवच् चतुर्मूर्तिः), of
which the form Naigameṣa went to the Gaṅgā
9. 43. 37, 39; then all the four, Rudra, Devī,
Pāvaka and the Gaṅgā, bowed down to Pitā-
maha (Brahmadeva) and requested him to
grant Kumāra the overlordship of all beings
i. e. of the kings of all the classes of gods
(आधिपत्यम्; सेनापत्यम् ददौ तस्मै
सर्वभूतेषु भारत।सर्वदेवनिकायानां
ये राजानः परिश्रुताः।तान् सर्वान् व्यादि-
देशास्मै सर्वभूतपितामहः) 9. 43. 42,
44, 48, 49; when the gods gave different gifts
to Kumāra, Gaṅgā gave him a divine water
vessel which was the source of the nectar
(कमण्डलुं दिव्यम् अमृतोद्भवम् उत्त-
मम्) 9. 45. 45; people call Kumāra diffe-
rently the son of Pitamaha, or of Maheśvara,
or of Umā, or of the Kṛttikās, or of the
Gaṅgā 9. 45. 86; the incident is also allud-
ed to in 3. 207. 4; 13. 27. 87 (इयं गाङ्गा
 … गुहस्य रुक्मस्य च गर्भयोषा; Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 88: गर्भयोषा गर्भ-
धारिणी स्त्री); (iii) Once when the gods
performed a सत्र in the Naiṃiṣa forest (3.
189. 1), they saw a (golden) lotus coming
floating on the river Bhāgīrathī; to find out
its source, Indra went to the place of the
origin of the Gaṅgā (यत्र गङ्गा सततं
संप्रसूता); he saw there a woman weeping
while standing in the water of the river; the
tear which fell in the water became a golden
lotus 1. 189. 10-11; (iv) When, in former
times, Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) once per-
formed a sacrifice on the Mahendra mountain,
Bhāgīrathī was present in the सदस् (यत्र
भागीरथी पुण्या सदस्यासीत्) 3. 85. 17;
(v) When the fish, reared by Manu, outgrew
the size of the large वापी, it requested Manu
to take it to the Gaṅgā, the chief wife of the
ocean (समुद्रमहीषीम् … गङ्गाम्); as
requested, Manu took the fish to the Gaṅgā
and put it in its water; when the fish further
so grew in size that it could not move in the
Gaṅgā (गङ्गायां हि न शक्नोमि बृहत्वाच्
देष्टितुं प्रभो), it requested Manu to take
it to the ocean; accordingly Manu pulled it
out of the Gaṅgā and took it to the ocean
3. 185. 18-19, 21-22; (vi) Nārada, once
early in the morning, descended into the water
of the Gaṅgā arising at the Dhruvadvāra to
take bath (पिस्पृक्षुः); Indra also happened
to go there; both of them bathed in its water
(आप्लुत्य) and, with controlled mind, per-
formed जप; then they sat down on the bank,
covered with thin golden sand, to tell each
other stories told by gods and sages narrat-
ing holy deeds (पुण्यकर्मभिर् आख्याता
देवर्षिकथिताः कथाः) 12. 221. 6-9; (vii)
The two rivers, the Gaṅgā and the Sarasvatī,
became the eyebrows of Nārāyaṇa when he
assumed a different form by his mighty device
(ऐश्वरेण प्रयोगेण द्वितीयां तनुम् आश्री-
तः) to get back the Vedas stolen by the two
Dānavas Madhu and Kaiṭabha 12. 335. 43,
46; (viii) Mṛtyu, conceived as a woman
(12. 249. 15-18), avoiding to kill men, went
to the river Gaṅgā on the mountain Meru
and stood there motionless like a piece of
wood 12. 250. 22; (ix) Mārkaṇḍeya saw the
Gaṅgā, among other rivers, in the belly of
the Bāla (3. 186. 83, i. e. Nārāyaṇa 3. 187.
3) 3. 186. 93; (x) When Śiva asked Umā
to instruct him in the duties of women (स्त्री-
धर्म 13. 134. 10), she first wanted to
consult the rivers, the Gaṅgā and others, who
were expert in that subject (स्त्रीधर्म-
कुशलाः); when Umā approached the rivers
they appointed the Gaṅgā to address Umā
on their behalf; the river told Umā that they
felt blessed since Umā held them in high
esteem, but it was indeed Umā who was the
right person to instruct them in the स्त्री-
धर्म; when the goddess (Umā) was thus
honoured by the Gaṅgā she discoursed on the
स्त्रीधर्मस् to them 13. 134. 17-30; (xi)
Once, when the ocean asked the rivers why
they carried away large trees but not the
small and weak cane growing on their banks,
the Gaṅgā told him the reason convincingly
giving the grounds 12. 114. 3-7; (xii)
Rāma crossed (the Gaṅgā) at Śṛṅgaverapura
3. 83. 4; (xiii) Once, while Śiva was
seated on the peak of the mountain Meru
and was being attended upon by gods and
others, the Gaṅgā in bodily form (रूपिणी)
waited on him 12. 274. 16.
G. Similes:
The Gaṅgā, in various aspects, figures as an
उपमान: (1) To compare an army with:
(i) The army of Duryodhana, returning to
the Hāstinapura, with its white parasols,
banners, and the very white chowries was an
image of the current of the Gaṅgā (गङ्-
गौघप्रतिमा चमूः) 3. 240. 42; (ii)
The army of Duryodhana, eleven अक्षौहिणीस्
strong, looked like the Gaṅgā while at some
distance from the Yamunā (गङ्गेव यमु-
नान्तरे) 6. 18. 18; (iii) The army of the
Pāṇḍavas proceeding to the battle-field looked
full and irresistible like the Gaṅgā (गङ्गेव
पूर्णा दुर्धर्षा) 5. 149. 49; (iv) The
army, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, with its formid-
able archers looked full, tranquil and flowing
like the Gaṅgā (भीमधन्वायनी सेना …
गङ्गेव पूर्णा स्तिमिता स्यन्दमाना व्यदृ-
श्यत) 5. 197. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 196.
12: भीमधन्वानः अयन्ते प्रचरन्त्य्
अस्याम् इति भीमधन्वायनी); 6. 19. 17;
(v) Just as the sweet water of the Gaṅgā
becomes salty due to the property of the
ocean, similarly the valour of the heroes of
Duryodhana would be futile on meeting the
Pāṇḍavas 6. 79. 5-6; (vi) Duryodhana
desired to cross (the army of the Pāṇḍa-
vas) as one would want to cross in rainy
season the current of the Gaṅgā full of
sharks, alligators and crocodiles (सग्राहन-
क्रमकरं गङ्गावेगम् इवोष्णगे; Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 139. 11: उष्णगे उष्णातिगमे
वर्षाकले) 5. 137. 11; (vii) Bhīma would
enter the army of the Kauravas as does the
current of the Gaṅgā the trees growing on
its banks 5. 50. 35; (viii) The Trigartas
(five brothers), in the war, would agitate
the army of the Pāṇḍavas as the crocodiles
agitate water of the Gaṅgā 5. 163. 10;
(ix) The army of the Kauravas, attacked
by Arjuna, was split into two (some going
to Droṇa, some to Duryodhana) as does the
Gaṅgā on meeting a mountain 7. 29. 29;
(x) The army of the Kauravas, at the sight
of Ghaṭotkaca, was struck with fear and was
agitated, as are the surging waves of the
Gaṅgā, whose eddies are agitated by wind
7. 131. 31; (xi) The Pāñcālas attacked the
army of Duryodhana on all sides as the
swans, returning from the Mānasa lake,
rush towards the Gaṅgā 8. 43. 64; (xii)
The army of the Pāṇḍavas was agitated by
the Madra warriors as is the Gaṅgā by the
hostile wind (पुरोवातेन गङ्गेव) 9. 17.
10; (xiii) When the Kaurava heroes (Droṇa
and others), who were ready (for attack)
at a distance of twenty steps attacked Abhi-
manyu, they appeared, for a while, like an
eddy of the Gaṅgā and the ocean (where the
former meets the latter) (ते विंशतिपदे
यत्ताः संप्रहारं प्रचक्रिरे।आसीद्
गाङ्ग इवावर्तो मुहूर्तम् उदधेर् इव)
7. 35. 13 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 7. 36.
13: विंशतिर् इति व्यूहपर्यायः।तद् उक्तम्
‘विंशत्यङ्गतया व्यूहो विंशतिर् व्यपदिश्-
यते’ इति।विंशतेः पदे रक्षणे); (xiv)
The armies of Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira
clashed speedily with each other as do the
swollen waters of the Gaṅgā and the Sarayū
in the rainy season 7. 16. 49; (xv) The
two large armies led by Droṇa and Dhṛsṭa-
dyumna, having clashed with each other,
sped along as do the swollen waters of the
Jāhnavī and the Yamunā in the rainy
season 7. 70. 8; (xvi) The armies led by
Karṇa and Arjuna clashed fiercely as do the
Gaṅgā and the Yamunā 8. 31. 68; (2) In
other contexts: (i) The river of smoke
which connected the heaven and the earth
looked like the river Gaṅgā (coming down
from the heaven to the earth) (भूमौ
स्वर्गे च संबद्धाम् नदीं धूम-
मयीम् नृपः (= ययातिः)।स गङ्गाम् इव
गच्छन्तीम् आलम्ब्य जगतीपतिः) 5. 119.
12; (ii) The sages (the Vālakhilyas and
others) sat near the Sarasvatī adorning it as
do the gods the river Gaṅgā 9. 36. 47; (iii)
Duḥṣanta entered the forest on the river
Mālinī which was like the hermitage of Nara
and Nārāyaṇa on the river Gaṅgā 1. 64. 24;
(iv) King Bṛhadratha between his two wives
looked like the ocean in the bodily form
between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā (गङ्गा-
यमुनयोर् मध्ये मूर्तिमान् इव सागरः)
2. 16. 19; (v) King Divodāsa enjoyed
pleasures with Mādhavī as does the ocean
with the Jāhnavī 5. 115. 10; (vi) The eye-
brow with its three tips on the forehead of
the angered Bhīma looked like the Gaṅgā
flowing in three courses on the Trikūṭa (त्रि-
शिखां भ्रुकुटीम् चास्य ददृशुः सर्व-
पार्थिवाः।ललाटस्थां त्रिकूटस्थां गङ्-
गां त्रिपथगाम् इव) 2. 39. 11; (vii)
As the Gaṅgā is the best among the rivers,
so is the Kapilā among the cows (यथा
हि गङ्गा सरितां वरिष्ठा तथार्जुनीनाम्
कपिला वरिष्ठा) 13. 72. 40; (viii) A
certain Nāga named Padma was born in a
family which was (pure) like the water of
the Gaṅgā (गङ्गाह्रदाम्भो ऽभिजनोप-
पन्नः) 12. 343. 11; (ix) A man who
does not have anything desirable never gets
anything that is splendid; he goes into noth-
ing as does the Gaṅgā on reaching the ocean
(प्रियाभावाच् च पुरुषो नैव प्राप्नोति
शोभनम्।ध्रुवं चाभावम् अभ्येति
गत्वा गङ्गेव सागरम्) 5. 133. 16; (x)
Wealth causes hankering after it as does the
sweet water of the Gaṅgā (अनुतर्षुल एवार्-
थः स्वादु गाङ्गम् इवोदकम्) 12. 171.
28; (xi) Gaṅgā is comparable to the earth
in forbearance, protection and sustenance; to
the fire and the sun in brightness; and to
Guha in being always favourable to the
Brāhmaṇas (क्षान्त्या मह्या गोपने धारणे
च दीप्त्या कृशानोस् तपनस्य चैव।तुल्या
गङ्गा संमता ब्राह्मणानाम् गुहस्य
ब्रह्मण्यतया च नित्यम्॥) 13. 27. 91.
H. Measure: (1) King Amūrtarayasa Gaya
gave away in a horse sacrifice as many cows
as there is sand on the river Gaṅgā 12. 29.
111; (2) Śaibya, the son of Uśīnara, gave
in a sacrifice as दक्षिणा as many cows as
would, while drinking (the water of the
Gaṅgā), drink up the current of the Gaṅgā
(? पिबन्त्यो दक्षिणां यस्य गण्गास्रोतः
समपिबन्।तावतीर् गा ददौ वीर उशी-
नरसुतो ऽध्वरे॥) 7. 9. 62. [See Alaka-
nandā, Ākāśagaṅga, Āpaga2, Urvaśī, Gangā-
dvara, Gaṅgāhrada, Vaitaraṇī]

offered many अग्निहोत्रस् and flower offerings
between the banks (?) (कृतपुष्पोपहारेषु
तीरान्तरगतेषु च) 1. 206. 6, 8-10; (ii)

Duryodhana, once out for hunting, went near
the Dvaitavana lake; he asked his servants
to set up sporting tents (आक्रीडावसथाः
क्षिप्रं क्रियन्ताम्); so they started towards
the lake but the Gandharvas who had arrived
there before, obstructed Duryodhana's servants
who were approaching the lake; when this
was reported to Duryodhana he asked his
army to oust the Gandharvas; so they returned
to the lake 3. 229. 13, 16-19, 23; (7) The
return of the Pāṇḍavas to the Dvaitavana lake
after their encounter with the Gandharvas is
referred to in the list of the contents of the

1. 2. 122-123; (8) When Balarāma visited

शालवनेषु तेषु) 3. 26. 1; 3. 174. 23-24;
Balarāma arrived at the Dvaitavana and

the demon Kirmīra in the Kāmyaka forest,
the Pāṇḍavas proceeded towards the Dvaita-
vana 3. 12. 18; (2) The Pāṇḍavas wishing

3. 25. 13, 16; (3) In the Dvaitavana (not

ous woods of the Śāla trees along the river
Sarasvatī; there Yudhiṣṭhira satisfied the
twice-borns by offering them large-sized roots
and fruit; there Dhaumya officiated for their
religious rites to gods and manes; sage
Mārkaṇḍeya arrived there as a guest of the
Pāṇḍavas 3. 26. 1-4; (4) When the Pāṇḍa-
vas lived in the Dvaitavana, the forest
was full of Brāhmaṇas; the forest resounded
with the sound of Vedic recitations of the
Brāhmaṇas and the sound of the bow-strings
of the Pāṇḍavas; thus the Kṣatriya valour,
united with Brahmanic lustre, shone all the
more in the forest (संसृष्टं ब्रह्मणा
क्षत्रं भूय एव व्यरोचत); Baka Dāl-
bhya pointed out to Yudhiṣṭhira Bhṛgus and
others who, when protected by Yudhiṣṭhira,
gave offerings in fire (चरन्ति धर्मं
पुण्ये ऽस्मिंस् त्वया गुप्ता धृतव्रताः) 3.
27. 1-8; (5) Vyāsa advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
leave the Dvaitavana since staying long at
one place was not desirable; hence he went
from the Dvaita to the Kāmyaka forest 3.
37. 31-32, 37; (6) Later when the
Pāṇḍavas returned to the Dvaitavana from
the Gandhamādana, the ascetics in the forest
returned to them 3. 174. 22; (7) Karṇa
suggested to Duryodhana to visit the lake
Dvaitavana to show the pomp of the Kauravas
to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 226. 12-13; Duryodhana
approved of this idea; his only purpose was
to oust the Pāṇḍavas from the forest (न
हि द्वैतवने किंचिद् विद्यते ऽन्यत् प्रयो-
जनम्।उत्सादनम् ऋते तेषाम् वनस्थानां
मम द्विषः), and to show them, who
were in miserable condition, his pomp 3.
227. 5, 8-11; Karṇa suggested that their
pretext to visit the Dvaitavana should be to
meet the cowherds who awaited Duryodhana's
visit (घोषा द्वैतवने सर्वे त्वत्प्रतीक्षा
नराधिप।घोषयात्रापदेशेन गमिष्यामो
न संशयः) 3. 227. 19, 23; (8)
Yudhiṣṭhira reminded the Kauravas through
Saṃjaya of their defeat at the hands of the
Gandharvas in the Dvaitavana, where they
had arrived for the Ghoṣayātrā, and their
subsequent release from the captivity of
their adversaries by Bhīmasena and Arjuna
5. 23. 25; Śalya later alleged that in that
encounter with the Gandharvas Karṇa was
the first to run away from the battle
8. 28. 59; (9) After the Ghoṣayātrā
incident the Pāṇḍavas lived happily in the
Dvaitavana forest 3. 235. 25; (10)
Duḥśāsana sent a messenger to the Pāṇḍavas
and the Brāhmaṇas living in the Dvaitavana
to invite them to attend Duryodhana's
Vaiṣṇava Yajña 3. 242. 7; (11) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, disturbed by Karṇa's vow to kill
Arjuna, thought of leaving the Dvaita-
vana 3. 243. 21; (12) While living in the
Dvaitavana, Yudhiṣṭhira once saw deer in a
dream who requested him to leave the forest
and go elsewhere as, on account of their pre-
sence, only a few deer were left in that forest
3. 244. 2, 5; (13) At the end of the
twelfth year of their forest life the Pāṇḍavas
went from the Kāmyaka to the Mārkaṇḍeyā-
śrama in the Dvaitavana 3. 294. 43; 3. 295.
3; (14) During their stay in the Dvaita-
vana the Pāṇḍavas, while once braving for the
sake of a Brāhmaṇa (ब्राह्मणार्थे परा-
क्रान्ताः), met with great difficulty which,
however, ended happily 17. 3. 18-19; 18. 3.
31 (a reference to the Yakṣapraśṇa episode;
Yudhiṣṭhira was tested by Dharma in that
episode which took place in the Dvaitavana
3. 295. 7-3. 298. 25); (15) Yudhiṣṭhira,
at the end of the twelfth year, while dismiss-
ing those who stayed with him in the forest,
asked them to tell people that they did not
know where the Pāṇḍavas went after they
(the Pāṇḍavas) left them in the Dvaitavana
4. 4. 5; (16) In the Dvaitavana Arjuna
used to praise the heroic qualities of Sātyaki
for Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 85. 61; (17) Yudhiṣṭhira,
humiliated by Karṇa, blamed Arjuna for not
killing Karṇa and told Arjuna that he should
have admitted to the Pāṇḍavas in the
Dvaitavana itself that he would not be able
to stand up to Karṇa in the war 8. 48. 2;
(18) Yudhiṣṭhira was dejected at the thought
of the destruction in the war and was think-
ing of retiring to forest; Draupadī then
reminded him of his resolve to kill
Duryodhana and rule the earth which he had
announced to his brothers in the Dvaitavana
12. 14. 8; (19) In the Dvaitavana,
Balarāma met the sages, bathed in Dvaitavana

one of the four classes bathes there these

especially on the full moon day of the month
of Kārtika his fruit increases without ever
being destroyed (फलं तत्राक्षयं तस्य
वर्धते) 3. 80. 48, 51-52; stay at the
Puṣkara on the full moon night of the
Kārtika (कार्तिकीं वा वसेद् एकाम्) is equal
to performing an Agnihotra for a full hundred

Puṣkara morning and evening with folded
hands will have bathed in all the तीर्थस् and

mitted by a man or a woman it gets
destroyed as soon as one bathes in the
Puṣkara (पुष्करे स्नातमात्रस्य) 3. 80.
54; if a wise person even mentally longs
for the Puṣkaras (मनसाप्य् अभिकामस्य
पुष्कराणि मनस्विनः) all his sins are
cleansed and he is worshipped in heaven
(नाकपृष्ठे च पूज्यते) 3. 80. 45; (5)
At the Puṣkara ten thousand crores of तीर्थस्
are present at all the three divisions of the
day (सांनिध्यं पुष्करे येषां त्रिसन्-
ध्यम्) 3. 83. 42; (6) At this तीर्थ the
Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sādhyas,
the Maruts, the Gandharvas, and the Apsa-
rases are present at all times; Pitāmaha lived
there happily for ever 3. 80. 43, 46; (7)
The gods, the Daityas, and the Brahmani-
cal sages practised austerities and, by the
great religious merit thus acquired, they at-
tained divine योग (दिव्ययोगाः), i. e., they
attained perfection (सिद्धिं समभिसं-
प्राप्ताः) 3. 80. 44, 47; (8) By living at
the Puṣkara for twelve years a person who
is controlled and pure (नियतः शुचिः)
obtains the fruit of all sacrifices and goes to
the world of Brahman 3. 80. 56; (9)
Puṣkara is one of those place by visiting
which one becomes auspicious, has a divine
form, puts on heavenly garlands and being
rich in heavenly fragrance delights in the
world of the cows (? मोदन्ति गवां
विमाने) 13. 105. 44, 48 (for citation see
Karatoyinī); (10) Aṅgiras told Gautama
that by bathing (विगाह्य) in the Puṣkara
one rides in the Vimāna (विमानस्थः)
and is awakened by the praises of the
Apsarases 13. 26. 9; (11) Śaunaka advised
Janamejaya to visit the Puṣkara; such
visit gave the person longevity again in this
life (लब्धायुर् जीविते पुनः) 12. 148. 11;
(12) Parāśara told Janaka that more than
bathing in the water of Puṣkara one should
practise (lit. bathe in) austerities at the
Puṣkaras (पुष्करेषु) and other holy places
(अद्भ्यो भूयः प्लाव्यं तपसा वै
शरीरम्) 12. 286. 37; (13) Puṣkara
considered as the holy place of the mid-region
(पृथिव्यां नैमिषम् पुण्यम् अन्तरिक्षे च
पुष्करम्) 3. 81. 173; (however, Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 83. 202: अन्तरिक्षे सूर्य-
चन्द्रादिमार्गे नक्षत्रादिचक्रे पुष्करं
प्रापयतीत्य् अर्थः); (also see the section
G. Importance and
H. Simile below and
section
C. Epic events (2) and (3) above);
F. Limitations: (i) Giving gifts of horses
in very large numbers and of thousands of
cows to the Brāhmaṇas at the Puṣkara
(पुष्करेषु) was highly meritorious no
doubt; (दशायुतानि चाश्वानाम् अयुतानि च
विंशतिम्।पुष्करेषु द्विजातिभ्यः प्रादां
गाश् च सहस्रशः); but that was not
enough to enable one to reach the Brahma-
loka—this is what Bhagīratha told Brahman
13. 106. 11; (ii) Sprinkling one's body with
the water of the Puṣkara is not necessary for
one who listens to the Bhārata (यो भारतं
समधिगच्छति वाच्यमानं किं तस्य
पुष्करजलैर् अभिषेचनेन) 1. 2. 242 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 1. 2. 392: पुषकरं आदि-
तीर्थं शुण्डाग्रं वा तदुपाहृतजलैः);
G. Importance: (1) Puṣkara is the first
among the तीर्थस् as Madhusūdana is among
all gods (यथा सुराणाम् सर्वेषाम् आदिस् तु
मधुसूदनः।तथैव पुष्करं राजंस्
तीर्थानाम् आदिर् उच्यते) 3. 80. 55; (2) It
is not easy to go to the Puṣkara, not easy
to perform austerities there or to give gifts
there; to be able to live there is extremely
difficult (दुष्करं पुष्करं गन्तुं दुष्-
करं पुष्करे तपः।दुष्करं पुष्करे
दानं वस्तुं चैव सुदुष्करम्॥) 3. 80.
58; (3) Finds mention in the Daivata-
Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151. 14, 2.
H. Simile:
The entrance of the Kurukṣetra is as holy as
the Puṣkaras (कुरुक्षेत्रस्य तद् द्वारम्
 … संमिते पुष्कराणां च) 3. 81. 20-21.
[See Pitāmahasaras]

(2) Takṣaka, when he came to know the curse
of Kadrū, started practising severe austerities
at various sacred places one of them being the
Puṣkarāraṇya 1. 32. 3.
C. Holy: If
one resorts to the Puṣkarāraṇya and feeds
only a single Brāhmaṇa he rejoices as a result
of that act in this and the next world (प्रेत्य
चेह च मोदते); and, if he gives there
to a Brāhmaṇa, faithfully and without malice
(श्रद्धावान् अनसूयकः), vegetables, roots
and fruits on which he himself subsists, then
by that act, he gets the fruit of a horse sacri-
fice 3. 80. 49-50.

D. Epic events: (1) During his exile
Arjuna, after visiting the other तीर्थस् on the

ing come to know that Arjuna had arrived
at the Prabhāsadeśa, went there to meet him;
the two met at Prabhāsa; they sported there
according to their wishes and from there they
went to the Raivataka mountain 1. 210. 2-4,
8; (2) The Brāhmaṇas wished to visit the
Prabhāsa and the other तीर्थस् along with
Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 91. 10; (3) After visiting
Śūrpāraka, Yudhiṣṭhira went to Prabhāsa;
he bathed there and, with his brothers and

there severe austerities 3. 118. 15-17; (4)
Balarāma and Janārdana, along with the
Vṛṣṇi heroes, went to Prabhāsa to meet the
Pāṇḍavas; the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis held
consultations together at Prabhāsa 3. 118.
18; 3. 119. 1-3; (5) Arjuna, in his wander-
ings with the sacrificial horse, came to
Prabhāsa from Gokarṇa 14. 84. 12; (6)
Balarāma, in his तीर्थयात्रा, first went to
Prabhāsa 9. 34. 36; (7) The Yādavas,
desirous of visiting a तीर्थ, went to
Prabhāsa and lived there; there they were
engaged in a drinking bout (प्रावर्तत
महापानं प्रभासे); in the mutual kill-
ing that followed the Vṛṣṇi heroes, the Bhojas
and the Andhakas were all destroyed at
Prabhāsa 16. 9. 8-9.
E. Past and my-
thological events: (1) At Prabhāsa Kṛṣṇa,
observing restraint (नियमे स्थितः) stood
on one foot for a thousand divine years
(दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रकम्) to practise aus-
terities 3. 13. 14; (2) The sages Śukra,
Aṅgiras and others who came together at
Prabhāsa thought of going on a तीर्थयात्रा
from there; (3) Soma was cursed by
Dakṣa; as a result he was emaciated and could
not shine; Dakṣa Prajāpati advised him to
go to the तीर्थ of Sarasvatī (i. e. Prabhāsa)
and emerge from there after taking a bath;
when Soma did this he could wax again; but
for one half of the month he would wane;
so Soma went to Prabhāsa and emerged
after bath on the new moon day; he could
illuminate the worlds; the gods then reached
Prabhāsa and, in the company of Soma,
met Dakṣa; this is why Prabhāsa became
the most excellent of all the तीर्थस् (प्र-
भासं च यथा तीर्थं तीर्थानां प्र-
वरं ह्य् अभूत्); on every new moon day
the moon bathes in Prabhāsa and waxes
again; that is why Prabhāsa is so called
9. 34. 67-77; 9. 34. 36-39; (the bath in
the Hiraṇyasaras तीर्थ, which later became
known as Prabhāsa, was prescribed for Soma
by the sages 12. 329. 46).
F. Holiness:
(1) If one who is pure and has a controll-
ed mind (शुचिः प्रयतमानसः) bathes at
Prabhāsa he secures for himself the fruit of
an Agniṣṭoma and an Atirātra sacrifice 3.
80. 78; (2) According to Aṅgiras one
who bathes in Prabhāsa is awakened in a
विमान by the praises of Apsarases 13.
26. 9; (3) According to Aṅgiras, again,
one who with concentrated mind (समाहितः)
spends one night of the new moon day
(अमावास्याम्) at Prabhāsa has (as though)
a second birth as a Siddha (सिद्ध्यते ऽत्र
महाबाहो यो नरो जायते पुनः) 13. 26.
51; (4) According to a Gāthā sung by
Yayāti one who visits Prabhāsa lives long
again in this life (लब्धायुर् जीविते पुनः)
12. 148. 11; (5) If the high-souled persons,
observing vows, visit Prabhāsa they become
auspicious, obtain divine forms, wear divine
garlands, and full of divine fragrance they
reach the world of cows (? गवां विमाने)
13. 105. 45, 48 (for citation see Karatoyinī).
G. Importance: (1) God Agni himself is
always present there (यत्र संनिहितो नित्यं
स्वयम् एव हुताशनः) 3. 80. 77; (2) Men-
tioned in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa 13. 151.
18, 2.

passes by far all the other तीर्थस् (ततः
पुण्यतमं नास्ति त्रिषु लोकेषु भारत।
प्रयागः सर्वतीर्थेभ्यः प्रभवत्य् अधि-
कं विभो) 3. 83. 74 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 85.

what is best in Meru, i. e. its best characte-
ristics (मेरोः … यच् छ्रेष्ठं तत् समा-
चरेत्) 12. 138. 21 (according to Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 12. 140. 21 these are अचञ्चलत्वम् अनु-
ल्लङ्घनीयत्वं; according to Arjunamiśra
सर्वोच्चप्रकृतित्वं; according to Vimala-
bodha कोषबहुलत्वं सर्वोच्चप्रकृतित्वं
च; see Editor's notes, Cr. Ed. Vol. 14, p. 936);
(4) Prajāpati dwells in his residence (ब्रह्-
मसदस्) on the Mahāmeru while creating
the worlds; he dwells there with gods 3. 160.
13, 16; on the summit of Meru there is the
abode (सदन) of Svayaṃbhū (Brahmadeva)
13. 92. 7; Meru forms the pericarp of the
lotus (i. e. the earth) (कर्णिका तस्य पद्-
मस्य मेरुः); sitting on it Brahman creates
the world 12. 175. 37; (5) The seven mind-
born sons of Brahman, Dakṣa and others,
also live on the Mahāmeru 3. 160. 14; (6)
beyond the residence (सदन) of Brahman
on the Meru shines the highest place (परं
स्थानम्) of Nārāyaṇa 3. 160. 17-18; (7)
There god Paśupati (Śiva) himself sports
with Umā and other divine beings (दिव्यैर्
भूतैः समावृतः) wearing a garland of
Karṇikāra flowers reaching down up to his
feet and illuminating the surroundings on
the mountain with his three eyes; the
Siddhas there can see him 6. 7. 23-24; (8)
The seven high-souled sages and Kaśyapa
Prajāpati visit the mountain on every पर्-
वन् day 6. 7. 19; (9) On the top of
Meru, Uśanas Kāvya sports with the Daityas
(तस्यैव मूर्धन्य् उशनाः काव्यो दै-
त्यैः … ) 6. 7. 20 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6.
6. 22: रमत इति शेषः); (10) The gods
have their gardens there (यत्र देवोद्यानानि)
3. 247. 8; there the hosts of gods, the Gan-
dharvas, the Asuras and the Rākṣasas always
sport in the company of the Apsarases 6. 7.
16; (11) There Brahman, Rudra and Śakra,
the king of gods, come together and offer
various sacrifices giving many दक्षिणास् (स-
मेत्य विविधैर् यज्ञैर् यजन्ते ऽनेकदक्-
षिणैः) 6. 7. 17; (12) All the jewels and
the six jewelled mountains (षड् एते रत्न-
पर्वताः 6. 7. 2) belong to Meru (तस्य
हीमानि रत्नानि तस्येमे रत्नपर्वताः) 6. 7.
20 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 6. 6. 22: तस्य
काव्यस्य); from it Kubera gets one fourth
share and from what he has obtained he gives
to men a portion of its sixteenth part (तस्-
मात् कुबेरो भगवांश् चतुर्थं भागम्
अश्नुते।ततः कलांशं वित्तस्य मनुष्ये-
भ्यः प्रयच्छति॥) 6. 7. 21 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 6. 6. 23: कलांशं षोडशभागस्यापि
लेशम्); (13) Tumburu, Nārada, Viśvāvasu,
Hahā, Huhū and the foremost among gods
gather together and praise (mount Meru)
with praises 6. 7. 18; (14) The sun (आदित्य)
drags behind him all the luminaries and going
round Meru, keeping it to the right, he dispels
darkness (एतं ज्योतींषि सर्वाणि प्रकर्षन्
भगवान् अपि।कुरुते वितमस्कर्मा आदि-
त्यो ऽभिप्रदक्षिणम्) 3. 160. 24; the sun
goes to the Asta mountain and, passing the
twilight there (संध्याम् अतिक्रम्य) he goes
to the north; again continuing his journey
along Meru (स मेरुम् अनुवृत्तः सन्) the
sun goes eastwards 3. 160. 25-26; 3. 102.
2-3; this path of the sun is unhindered (मार्-
गम् एतद् असम्बाधम् आदित्यः परिवर्तते)
3. 160. 29; this route of the sun round Meru
was ordained by the Creator of the world
(एष मार्गः प्रदिष्टो मे येनेदं निर्मितं
जगत्) 3. 102. 4; similarly the moon, along
with the नक्षत्रस्, moves round Meru
dividing the duration of the month into पर्-
वन्स् and returns to Mandara (स मासं
विभजन् कालं बहुधा पर्वसंधिषु।
तथैव भगवान् सोमो नक्षत्रैः सह
गच्छति॥) 3. 160. 27-28; besides the sun,
the moon and the नक्षत्रस्, Vāyu also moves
round Meru keeping it to the right (अनु-
पर्येति … वायुश् चैव प्रदक्षिणम्) 6. 7.
14; (15) The seven divine sages (देव-
र्षयः), chief among whom is Vasiṣṭha, also
set on this mountain and again rise there
(अत्रैव प्रतितिष्ठन्ति पुनर् अत्रोदयन्ति
च) 3. 160. 15; (16) All birds on mount
Meru are golden (सौवर्णान् प्रेक्ष्य वाय-
सान्) 6. 7. 12; seeing them the bird Sumukha,
son of Suparṇa, thought of leaving mount
Meru since it made no distinction between the
best, the intermediate, and the lowest (मेरुर्
उत्तममध्यानाम् अधमानां च पक्षि-
णाम्।अविशेषकरो यस्मात् तस्माद् एनं
त्यजाम्य् अहम्॥) 6. 7. 13; (17) There is
a large, good-looking (सुदर्शन 13. 105. 20)
Jambū tree called Sudarśana (सुदर्शनो नाम)
on mount Meru 6. 8. 18; the river formed by
the juice of the fruit of this tree flows round
Meru and goes to the Uttara Kurus (मेरुं
प्रदक्षिणं कृत्वा संप्रयात्य् उत्तरान्
कुरून्) 6. 8. 23; (18) From the summit
of mount Meru the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī
falls down with terrific speed in the Cāndra-
masa lake 6. 7. 26-27; (19) Various tribes
like the Khaśas, the Ekāśanājyohas (?), the
Pradaras, the Dīrghaveṇus, the Paśupas, the
Kuṇindas, the Taṅgaṇas, and the Parataṅ-
gaṇas live in the valley of the mountains
Meru and Mandara (मेरुमन्दरयोर् मद्-
ह्ये) 2. 48. 2-3; (20) Swans and vultures
go to Meru by passing through a hole in the
Krauñca mountain made by Skanda 3. 214.
31.
D. Holiness: One who falls down
along the precipice of Meru is freed of all
blemishes (मेरुप्रपातं प्रपतन् … मुच्-
यते सर्वकिल्बिशैः) 12. 36. 14; Brāhmaṇas
who are truthful, learned, kind to all beings,
who study the Itihāsa and the Purāṇa, who
offer honey offerings to Brāhmaṇas (मध्-
वाहुत्या जुह्वति च द्विजेभ्यः) go to the
regions of Meru 13. 105. 21-22.
E. Im-
portance: (1) While narrating his विभूतिस्
Bhagavān told Arjuna that he was Meru

ceived as a woman, was reluctant to carry

gold obtained from Meru 14. 4. 25-27; (16)
Ekata, Dvita and Trita told Bṛhaspati that
the country where they practised austerities
in order to see Nārāyaṇa lay to the north of
Meru and on the shores of the ocean of milk
12. 323. 21; (17) Rāma (Jāmadagnya ?)
ordered the removal of his matted locks (?)
at a place called Muñjavaṭa on Muñja-
pṛṣṭha on Meru (यत्र मुञ्जवटे रामो
जटाहरणम् आदिशत्) 12. 122. 3; (18) On
the slope (पार्श्व) of Meru was the her-
mitage of Vasiṣṭha where he practised auste-
rities 1. 93, 6-7; Vasiṣṭha, grieved over the
death of his sons, jumped down from the
summit of Meru to end his life (but he did
not die) 1. 166. 41; (19) The great sage

(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 325. 14: मेरोर् वर्षं
इलावृतम्।हरेर् वर्षं हरिवर्षाख्यम्);
when Śuka moved through the sky he saw
before him the two summits of Meru and
Himavant closely connected with each other;
undeterred Śuka went on flying and suddenly
the two peaks split into two; that was a
marvel; Śuka passed beyond the two peaks
and the mountain (Meru or Himavant ?)
could not stop his movement; the mountain
was split into two 12. 320. 8, 10-11, 13;
(22) In order to go to the Śvetadvīpa Nārada
flew up in the sky and reached the top of
Meru 12. 322. 6; after seeing Hari on
the Śvetadvīpa, Nārada returned to Meru;

heaven Śiva held the river on his head on
Meru (or Himavant ?) and from there the
river reached the earth (दिवश् च्युता शिरसात्ता
भवेन गङ्गावनीध्रात्) 13. 27. 89 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 89: अवनीध्रस्य
मेरोः हिमवतो वा पर्वतस्य; on 13. 26.

50: अत्र चन्द्रकेत्वोर् मेरुसरथभीष्म-
योश् चोपमो (? उपमानो) पमेयभावः।
भीष्मस्य रुक्मरथत्वात्); (xv) Arjuna
was best among warriors as Meru is among
the mountains 5. 63. 5; (b) Outside the epic
war: (i) Rāma (Jāmadagnya) with blood
issuing from the wounds all over his body
appeared like Meru throwing out the red mine-
rals (मेरुर् धातून् इवोत्सृजन्) 5. 180. 30;
(c) Other contexts: (i) Śiva's body, when
he was dressed like a Kirāta which made him
look like a golden tree, appeared like another
Meru (कैरातं वेषम् आस्थाय काञ्चन-
द्रुमसंनिभम्।विभ्राजमानो वपुषा
गिरिर् मेरुर् इवापरः॥) 3. 40. 2; (ii)
(Gāndhārī, Kuntī, and other) Kaurava women

it and since it offered shelter to travellers
(सार्थाधिवासैश् च) it shone like Meru
12. 150. 17; (vii) A tree called Mahāśaṅkha
at the Śaṅkhatīrtha was as tall as Mahāmeru
9. 36. 20 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 37. 31: नगं
वृक्षम्); (viii) The burning Khāṇḍava
forest looked like the highly lustrous, golden

great delight (अतिहर्षो ऽयम् अस्थाने 7. 155.

15; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Lomaśa why Vindhya
suddenly started to grow 3. 102. 1; Vindhya
asked the sun to make a प्रदक्षिणा round
him as it did round Meru; the sun told the
mountain that he did not do it at his own
will, but that was the course laid down by the
Creator; when the sun did not oblige, Vindhya,
angered, began to grow and obstructed the
path of the sun and the moon; the gods tried to
stop him from growing but Vindhya did not
stop; the gods then approached Agastya and
told him that Vindhya, under the influence of
anger, was covering the path of the luminaries;
they added that no one else except the sage was
able to dissuade the mountain; hearing that
Agastya, in the company of his wife, appro-
ached Vindhya and told him that he wanted
to go to the south on some purpose; he asked
the mountain to wait for his return and grow
again as desired after he returned; Agastya
made this contract with Vindhya but never re-
turned from the south; Vindhya was thus made
to stop growing due to the power of Agastya

6. 10. 35 (also see the next section C).
C. Characteristics: (1) Sarasvatī appears
and disappears again at various places (दृश्या-
दृश्या च भवति तत्र तत्र सरस्वती)
6. 7. 47; the trees growing on the banks of
Sarasvatī are (सरस्वतीतीररुहैः … शोभि-
तम्): Badara, Iṅguda, Kāśmarya, Plakṣa,
Aśvattha, Vibhītaka, Panasa, Palāśa, Karīra,
Pīlu, Bandhana, Syandana, Bilva, Āmrātaka,
and Pārijāta; there are also on its bank
forests of Parūṣaka (परूषकवनैश् चैव)
and groves of Atimuktaka (अतिमुक्तक-
षण्डैश् च) 9. 36. 58-60; auspicious Śāla
forests grow on its banks (शिवेषु।सरस्वती-
शालवनेषु तेषु) 3. 26. 1; the big Mahā-
śaṅkha tree is on its bank 9. 36. 20; the forests
on its bank are inhabited by the righteous who
have controlled their self and who wear bark
garments and have matted hair and also
by hosts of perfected sages (भोगवतीम्
उपेत्य धृतात्मनां चीरजटाधराणाम्
तस्मिन् वने धर्मभृतां निवासे।ददर्श
सिद्धर्षिगणान् अनेकान्) 3. 25. 20; cf. 3. 26.
1; (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 24. 20: भोगवतीं
सरस्वतीं नदीम्); always pleasing to
Dadhīca (मम प्रीयकरी चापि सततं)
9. 50. 20; Śūdras and hosts of Ābhīras took
resort on Sarasvatī and lived on fish (शूद्रा-
भीरगणाश् चैव ये चाश्रित्य सरस्वतीम्।
वर्तयन्ति च ये मत्स्यैः) 2. 29. 9; there is
no pleasure, there are no virtues which are
equal to the residence on Sarasvatī (सरस्वती-
वास समा कुतो रतिः सरस्वतीवाससमाः
कुतो गुणाः) 9. 53. 34; Sarasvatī disappears in
the desert at Vinaśana, but appears again at
Camasa, Śivodbheda and Nāgodbheda 3. 80.
118; (13. 139. 26); the Siddhas know, due to
the wetness of plants and earth, the presence
of Sarasvatī there though not seen (स्निग्ध-
त्वाद् ओषधीनां च भूमेश् च जनमेजय।
जानन्ति सिद्धा राजेन्द्र नष्टाम् अपि सर-
स्वतीम्॥) 9. 34. 81; at Camasodbheda all
ocean going rivers turn to her (यत्रैनाम्
अभ्यवर्तन्त दिव्याः पुण्याः समुद्रगाः)
3. 130. 5.
D. Holiness: (1) Vaiśaṃ-
pāyana told Janamejaya the holiness of the
Tīrthavaṃśa of Sarasvatī (here in particular
of the Aujasatīrtha 9. 45. 92) 9. 45. 88; Sara-
svatī and the तीर्थस् on Sarasvatī are holier
than Kurukṣetra (पुण्यम् आहुः कुरु-
क्षेत्रं कुरुक्षेत्रात् सरस्वतीम्।सर-
स्वत्याश् च तीर्थानि) 3. 81. 125; by the
favour of sage Dadhīca, Sarasvatī was to
be at all times holiest among the other holy
rivers (पुण्याभ्यश् च सरिद्भ्यस् त्वं सदा
पुण्यतमा शुभे।भविष्यसि महाभागे
मत्प्रसादात् सरस्वति) 9. 50. 23; (9. 53.
35); (2) By bathing in the river Sarasvatī
one washes off one's sins (धूतपाप्मा
भविष्यसि) 3. 129. 20; by bathing in Sara-
svatī one rides in a विमान (सरस्वत्याम्
उपस्पृश्य विमानस्थो विराजते) 3. 82. 139;
by visiting Sarasvatī people have gone to
heaven; those who have done evil acts if
they visit Sarasvatī they never grieve in this
or the other world (सरस्वतीं प्राप्य जनाः
सुदुष्कृताः।सदा न शोचन्ति परत्र चेह
च॥) 9. 53. 34-35; according to the Gāthās
sung by Yayāti (12. 148. 8) if one bathes
and drinks water at Pṛthūdaka on Sarasvatī
one does not have to worry about death in
near future (नैव श्वोमरणं तपेत्) 12.
148. 10; this was also told by Ruṣaṅgu to
his sons 9. 38. 29; by visiting Sarasvatī and
by satisfying there gods and manes one re-
joices undoubtedly in the worlds of Sarasvatī
(सारस्वतेषु लोकेषु मोदते नात्र सं-
शयः) 3. 82. 59; by bathing at the तीर्थ
on Sarasvatī gods, Gandharvas, Apsarases,
Dvaipāyana, Śuka, Kṛṣṇa, Yakṣas and many
others became perfected in Yoga (योग-
सिद्धाः) 9. 48. 18-20; one should live on
Sarasvatī for a month 3. 81. 3; (3) By
bathing at the confluence of Gaṅgā and Sara-
svatī one gets the fruit of an Aśvamedha and
goes to heaven 3. 82. 34; by visiting the place
where Sarasvatī meets the ocean (सरस्वत्याः
सागरस्य च संगमे) one gets the fruit
of gifting a thousand cows and shining always
with lustre like that of fire he is glorified in
heaven (स्वर्गलोके महीयते।दीप्यमानो
ऽग्निवन् नित्यं प्रभया); living there for
three nights one should satisfy manes and
gods; he thereby shines like the moon (प्र-
भासते यथा सोमः … ) and gets the reward
of an Aśvamedha 3. 80. 79-80; at the con-
fluence of Sarasvatī (the other river is not
named) people worship Janārdana; Brahmā
and other gods, as well as sages and Siddhas
and Cāraṇas, visit it on the fourteenth day
of the bright half of Caitra 3. 80, 130; it is
recommended that one should live at Kuru-
kṣetra on Sarasvatī for a month (तत्र (कुरु-
क्षेत्रे) सरस्वत्यां मासं वसेत्) 3. 81.
3; (4) There are many तीर्थस् on Sara-
svatī 5. 154. 33; 9. 34. 33; all these तीर्थस्
are holy 3. 81. 125; their holiness described
in the Śalyaparvan (शल्यपर्वणि … सर-
स्वत्याश् च तीर्थानां पुण्यता परिकीर्तिता)
1. 2. 174-175; these तीर्थस् are: Śaśayāna
3. 80. 120-121; a तीर्थ sacred to Aran-
tuka, chief of Yakṣas 3. 81. 42; Śrīkuñja
3. 81. 91; Naimiṣakuñja 3. 81. 92; Devī-
tīrtha at the confluence of Sarasvatī and Aruṇā
3. 81. 131; Vinaśana 3. 130. 3; Camasodbheda
3. 130. 5; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana
to tell him the origin, the merits, the reward
of visiting them, and how one achieves suc-
cessful completion of visiting the तीर्थस् on
Sarasvatī (सारस्वतानां तीर्थानां गुणोत्-
पत्तिं वदस्व मे।फलं च द्विपदां
श्रेष्ठ कर्मनिर्वृत्तिम् एव च॥ 9. 34. 33:
Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 35. 38: कर्मनिर्वृत्तिं
तीर्थयात्राविधिसिद्धिम्); Vaiśaṃpāyana's
account includes Prabhāsa 9. 34. 36; Cama-
sodbheda 9. 34. 78; Subhūmika 9. 36. 3;
Gargasrotas 9. 36. 14, 16; Śaṅkhatīrtha 9.
36. 24; Auśanasa 9. 38. 16, also called
Kapālamocana 9. 38. 20; Pṛthūdaka 9.
38. 25-26; a तीर्थ not named 9. 38. 33;
9. 39. 6, 10, 23, 30; (5) The region
deserted by Sarasvatī would be bereft of
holiness (अपुण्य एष भवतु देशश् त्यक्तस्
त्वया शुभे) 13. 139. 26; cows act like
Sarasvatīs (pl.) in delivering persons from
the remainder of their actions (?), in free-
ing them from the body and in the obtain-
ment of bliss (शेषोत्सर्गे कर्मभिर् देह-
मोक्षे सरस्वत्यः श्रेयसि संप्रवृत्ताः)
13. 75. 12 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 76. 12:
(गावः) क्षयरोगादिनिवृत्तौ देहमोक्षे च
कर्मभिः पञ्चगव्यादिभिः सेविताः सत्यः
सरस्वत्यो नद्य इव श्रेयसे संप्रवृत्ताः);
one should live on the rivers Sarasvatī and
Dṛṣadvatī worshipping them, doing one's
studies and bathing in all places (सरस्वती-
दृषद्वत्यौ सेवमानो ऽनुसंचरेः।स्वा-
ध्यायशीलः स्थानेषु सर्वेषु समुपस्पृ-
शेः) 12. 148. 12; but sage Parāśara told to
king Janaka that, more than with waters of
the rivers, one should bathe one's body with
austerities (i. e. one should practise austeri-
ties) at all holy places like Sarasvatī, Nai-
miṣa, Puṣkara and the rest (अद्भ्यो भूयः
प्लाव्यं तपसा वै शरीरम्।सरस्वती-
नैमिषपुष्करेषु ये चाप्य् अन्ये पुण्यदेशाः
पृथिव्याम्) 12. 286. 37; (6) Sarasvatī suited
for sacrifices: (i) The fire-altar of Prajāpati
was on holy Sarasvatī (सरस्वतीम् इमां
पुण्यां पश्य … वेदी प्रजापतेर् एषा) 3.
129. 20, 22; (ii) Many sages, divine sages,
and royal sages had offered sacrifices on
Sarasvatī (इह सारस्वतैर् यज्ञैर् इष्टवन्-
तः सुरर्षयः।ऋषयश् चैव कौन्तेय
तथा राजर्षयो ऽपि च) 3. 129. 21; (iii)
Formerly Vālakhilya sages offered sacrifices
on Ṣarasvatī 3. 88. 9; (iv) Sarasvatī is
listed by Mārkaṇḍeya among the rivers which
are called mothers of the sacrificial hearths
(i. e. on the banks of which sacrifices were
performed) 3. 212. 21 (for citation and Nī.
see Kapilā); (7) Sarasvatī also mentioned
among the holy places by visiting which the
high-souled ones who have observed vows
(महात्मानो धृतव्रताः) assume heavenly
form and, becoming auspicious, wearing
heavenly garlands and rich in holy perfume,
they go to the world of cows (? ते तत्र
मोदन्ति गवां विमाने 13. 105. 44) 13.
105. 48 (for citation see Karatoyinī); (8)
According to Tulādhāra, however, all rivers
are equal in point of holiness to Sarasvatī
(सर्वा नद्यः सरस्वत्यः) 12. 255. 39.
E. Epic events: (1) The Pāṇḍavas, at the
beginning of their forest life, lived on the
banks of Sarasvatī, Yamunā and Gaṅgā;
they next saw the Kāmyaka forest on the
bank of Sarasvatī and lived there 3. 6. 3-4;
(2) The Pāṇḍavas saw in Dvaitavana the
river Bhogavatī (= Sarasvatī) (मनोरमां
भोगवतीम् उपेत्य … तस्मिन् वने (i. e. in
Dvaitavana)) 3. 25. 20; they sported in the
Śāla forests on the bank of Sarasvatī 3. 26.
1; the Pāṇḍavas left Dvaitavana and went to
Kāmyaka on the bank of Sarasvatī (ययौ
सरस्वतीतीरे काम्यकं नाम काननम्)
3. 37. 37; (3) Shown by Lomaśa to the
Pāṇḍavas 3. 130. 3; after crossing the desert
they reached Sarasvatī in order to live in
Dvaitavana 3. 174. 21; seeing them settled in
Dvaitavana ascetics came to them 3. 174. 22;
the Pāṇḍavas were happy roaming along the
river Sarasvatī 3. 174. 24; they spent the most
holy autumnal Kārtika full moon night while
living on the bank of Sarasvatī (तेषाम् पुण्य-
तमा रात्रिः पर्वसंधौ स्म शारदी।
तत्रैव वसताम् आसीत् कार्तिकी जनमे-
जय॥) 3. 179. 16; (4) Rāma Jāmadagnya,
along with Ambā and other ascetics, went to
Kurukṣetra to meet Bhīṣma and stayed near
Sarasvatī (न्यविशन्त ततः सर्वे परिगृह्य
सरस्वतीम्) 5. 177. 24; (5) After the fall
of Karṇa, the Kṣatriyas fighting on the side
of the Kauravas went to Sarasvatī flowing
near Himavant, and bathed, and drank her
water; they felt refreshed and returned
for the battle (अरुणां सरस्वतीं प्राप्य
पपुः सस्नुश् च तोज्जलम्) 9. 4. 49; (6)
Balarāma decided to go on a pilgrimage to
visit the तीर्थस् on Sarasvatī as he was not
prepared to watch the destruction of those
born in the Kuru family (तस्माद् यास्यामि
तीर्थानि सरस्वत्या निषेवितुम् । न हि शक्-
ष्यामि कौरव्यान् नश्यमानान् उपेक्षितुम्)
5. 154. 33; ha set out on the Maitra नक्षत्र;
from the ocean he started his pilgrimage up-
stream on the river (प्रतिस्रोतः सरस्वत्याः;

24; Balarāma mounted Himavant and saw
Plakṣaprasravaṇa tīrtha at the source of
Sarasvatī (प्रभवं च सरस्वत्याः प्ल-
क्षप्रस्रवणं बलः) 9. 53. 9-11; from
there he went to Kārapacana 9. 53. 11-12; at
Plakṣaprasravaṇa he heard about the destruc-
tion in the battle; so he descended from the
mountain Himavant and went to hte place
where the duel between Bhīma and Duryo-
dhana was to take place; he was delighted to
look at Sarasvatī again and again 9. 53. 33,
36-37; before leaving the place Balarāma sang
two stanzas praising the qualities of Sarasvatī
and describing her holiness 9. 53. 34-35; (7)
The prowess (प्रभाव) of Sarasvatī was
narrated by Vaiśaṃpāyana to Janamejaya 9.
43. 1 (reference to Adhyāyas 9. 39-42);
(8) The Pāṇḍavas and Duryodhana selected
a place which had no ditches near a तीर्थ
called Svayana to the south of Sarasvatī
(दक्षिणेन सरस्वत्याः स्वयनं तीर्थम्
उत्तमम् । तस्मिन् देशे त्व् अनिरिणे तत्र
युद्धम् अरोचयन् ॥) 9. 54. 13 (Nī.,
however, on Bom. Ed. 9. 55. 18: अनिरिणे
अणूषरे); (9) After the mutual destruc-
tion of the Yādavas, Arjuna established
Yauyudhāni, son of Sātyaki(n), in the region
of Sarasvatī (यौयुधानीम् सरस्वत्यां
पुत्रं सात्यकिनः प्रियम्।न्यवेशयत)
16. 8. 69; (10) Sixteen thousand wives of
Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) enterd the river Sarasvatī
(न्यमज्जन्त सरस्वत्याम्); they then
became the Apsarases and returned to Vāsu-
deva 18. 5. 21.
F. Past and Mythological
events: (1) King Matināra performed a
sacrificial session lasting for twelve years on
the bank of Sarasvatī; after the सत्र was
over, Sarasvatī chose Matināra for her hus-
band; a son was born to Sarasvatī, Taṃsu
by name; this is recorded in a stanza describ-
ing lineage (अत्रानुवंशो भवति।तंसुं
सरस्वती पुत्रं मतिनाराद् अजीजनत्) 1.
90. 25-28); (2) Describing past events in
Kṛṣṇa's life Arjuna said that in a सत्र
lasting for twelve years on Sarasvatī Kṛṣṇa
discarded his upper garment, became thin,
having stretched veins (अपकृष्टोत्तरासङ्गः
कृशो धमनिसंततः।आसीः कृष्ण सरस्व-
त्यां सत्रे द्वादशवार्षिके॥) 3. 13, 13 (Nī.
on 3. 12. 14; अपकृष्टोत्तरासङ्गः त्यक्तोत्त-
रीयवस्त्रः); (3) Sarasvatī is one of the
seven forms assumed by Gaṅgā on the moun-
tain Hiraṇyaśṛṅga (6. 7. 40); these forms
became famous as seven Gaṅgās in the three
worlds 6. 7. 44-45, 47; (4) Trita fell down
at night in a well which was not far away from
Sarasvatī 9. 35. 24-25; when Trita requested
gods to rescue him from the well, Sarasvatī,
full of waves, leapt up and threw Trita out of
the well (तत्र चोर्मिमती राजन्न् उत्पपात
सरस्वती।तयोत्क्षिप्तस् त्रितस् तस्थौ) 9. 35,
46; (5) Sarasvatī, in bygone days, dis-
appeared due to her hatred for Śūdras and
Ābhīras; the place where she disappear-
ed was named by sages Vinaśana tīrtha
(शूद्राभीरान् प्रति द्वेषाद् यत्र नष्टा
सरस्वती … तस्मात् तद् ऋषयो नित्यं प्राहुर्
विनशनेति ह॥) 9. 36. 1-2; (6) Sarasvatī,
flowing towards the east, returned from a
certain तीर्थ to the west out of her regard
for the sages living in the Naimiṣa forest;
formerly, in the Kṛta age, many sages from
the Naimiṣa forest, after completing सत्र
of twelve years, flocked to Sarasvatī for
pilgrimage (तीर्थकारणात्); on account of
their large numbers the तीर्थस् on the south
bank of Sarasvatī appeared like cities
(ऋषीणां बहुलत्वात् तु सरस्वत्या विशां
पते।तीर्थानि नगरायन्ते कूले वै दक्षिणे
तदा॥); these sages resorted to the bank
of Sarasvatī as far as the Samantapañcaka
on account of their love for तीर्थस् (तीर्थ-
लोभात्); due to the fires of their अग्नीहोत्रस्
the river shone (अशोभत सरिच्छ्रेष्ठा);
the sages, dwelling near Sarasvatī, beautified
the river as do gods the Ganges (शोभयन्-
तः सरिच्छ्रेष्ठाम् गङ्गाम् इव दिवौकसः);
when other sages arrived there to perform a
सत्र they found no place in Kurukṣetra;
then Sarasvatī showed herself to the despon-
dent sages (ततस् तम् ऋषिसंघातं निरा-
शं चिन्तयान्वितम्।दर्शयाम् आस राजेन्द्र
तेषाम् अर्थे सरस्वती); the river created
for them many bowers, returned (ततः
कुञ्जान् बहून् कृत्वा संनिवृत्ता सरिद्वरा),
and again flowed towards the west thinking
“I shall not render the arrival of the sages
futile; now I shall go my way”; this
is a great wonder that the river perfor-
med (भूयः प्रतीच्यभिमुखी सुस्राव
सरितां वरा॥अमोघा गमनं (अमोघा-
गमनम् ?) कृत्वा तेषां भूयो व्रजाम्य्
अहम्।इत्य् अद्भुतं महच् चक्रे ततो
राजन् महानदी) 9. 36. 35-53; (7) When
Maṅkaṇaka, who was observing chastity
(कौमारब्रह्मचारिणः) saw by chance
a woman taking bath in Sarasvatī his seed
fell into water; when it was collected in a
jar by the sage, the seed got divided into
seven parts; from it were born seven seers,
from whom sprang the Maruts (तत्रर्षयः
सप्त जाता जज्ञिरे मरुतां गणाः। … एवम्
एते समुत्पन्ना मरुतां जनयिष्णवः)
9. 37. 29-32 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 9. 38. 37
(एतेषां तपसा मरुतो ऽदित्याम् उत्पन्ना इति
कल्पान्तरविषयो ऽयम् अर्थः); (8) The
Brāhmaṇa Ruṣaṅgu, when he decided to
give up his body in old age, asked his sons
to carry him to Pṛthūdaka, a तीर्थ on
Sarasvatī; when he was carried to the river
by his sons, he took bath there (आप्लुतः)
and, knowing the qualities of the तीर्थ,
told his sons: “one who gives up his body
on the northern bank of Sarasvatī will not
have to worry about iminent death” (नैनं
श्वोमरणं तपेत्) 9. 38. 24-29, (9) Baka
Dālbhya, when insulted by Dhṛtarāṣṭra, son
of Vicitravīrya (9. 40. 1; probably different
from the son of Ambikā and the father of the
Kauravas), kindled fire at a desolate तीर्थ on
Sarasvatī (अवकीर्णे सरस्वत्यास् तीर्थे प्र-
ज्वाल्य पावकम् 9. 40. 12; Nī., however, who
reads अवाकीर्णम् takes it as the name of a
तीर्थ: अवाकीर्णं नाम दाल्भ्यसेवितं तीर्-
थं जगाम Bom. Ed. 9. 41. 1) and started
giving offerings of flesh of dead animals;
as a result the kingdom of Dhṛtarāṣṭra began
to waste away; he was therefore advised to
propitiate Baka in a bower in the water of
Sarasvatī (अपां कुञ्जे सरस्वत्यास् तं
प्रसादय पार्थिव) and request Baka to
forgive him for his fault 9. 40. 10-21; (also
see No. 27 below); (10) For the sacrifice
of Yayāti, son of Nahuṣa, Sarasvatī brought
in her currents clarified butter and milk
(घृतं पयश् च सुस्राव); in that sacri-
fice, Sarasvatī fulfilled the wishes of Brāh-
maṇas by producing many juices (?) in
accordance with their wishes (यत्र यत्र
हि यो विप्रो यान् यान् कामान् अभीप्सति।
तत्र तत्र सरिच्छ्रेष्ठा ससर्ज सुबहून्
रसान्) 9. 40. 30, 33; (11) Viśvāmitra
practised severe austerities on an excellent
तीर्थ (not named) of Sarasvatī and became
a Brāhmaṇa 9. 39. 23, 28-29; the आश्रम
of Vasiṣṭha was at Sthāṇutīrtha on the
eastern bank of Sarasvatī and that of
Viśvāmitra on the western bank; at the
तीर्थ Vasiṣṭhāpavāha, Viśvāmitra was able
to displace Vasiṣṭha with the help of severe
austerities (वसिष्ठं चालयाम् आस तप-
सोग्रेण) 9. 41. 4, 8; Viśvāmitra wanted
Sarasvatī to bring Vasiṣṭha to him swiftly
so that he could kill him (Vasiṣṭha); Viśvā-
mitra therefore thought of Sarasvatī; she
appeared before him, trembling with fear, and
asked him what she might do for him; Viśvā-
mitra told the river what he wanted her to do;
hearing that Sarasvatī was pained; she just
stood there all the while shaking with fear;
Viśvāmitra asked her again to bring Vasiṣṭha
quickly to him; she was worried what
to do as she was afraid of the curses
of both the sages; she went to Vasiṣṭha
and informed him what Viśvāmitra's desire
was; Vasiṣṭha saw her pale and lean and
told her to carry him to Viśvāmitra and save
herself from the latter's curse; hearing that
Sarasvatī reflected on what she might
do which would turn out beneficial to
Vasiṣṭha as he had been merciful to her;
when she saw on the other bank Viśvāmitra
engaged in giving offerings she thought that
to be the right moment to act swiftly (सरस्-
वत्य् अभ्यचिन्तयत्।इदम् अन्तरम् इत्य् एव
9. 41. 26-27); she washed away a part of
her bank on the side of Vasiṣṭha so that he
was carried on her current to the आश्रम of
Viśvāmitra; while he was being thus carried
Vasiṣṭha praised Sarasvatī (Sarasvatī's praise
9. 41. 29-31); Sarasvatī informed Viśvāmitra
that she had brought Vasiṣṭha; Viśvāmitra
began to look for a weapon to kill Vasiṣṭha;
being afraid of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa
Sarasvatī carried Vasiṣṭha back to the eastern
bank (ब्रह्महत्याभयान् नदी।अपोवाह
वसिष्ठं तु प्राचीं दिशम् अतन्द्रिता 9. 41.
34); she thus did what both the sages asked
her to do, but Viśvāmitra was deceived;
enraged, he cursed the river to flow with
blood; as a result Sarasvatī flew with water
mixed with blood for a year; the sages, gods,
Gandharvas and Apsarases were excessively
pained to see Sarasvatī in that condition; this
is how the तीर्थ Vasiṣṭhāpavāha came into
existance 9. 41. 11-39; when Sarasvatī
carried blood with water in her current,
Rākṣasas came there and were happy to drink
blood from the river water; once, some sages,
while visiting the तीर्थस्, came to Vasiṣṭhā-
pavāha they saw the Rākṣasas drinking
blood from the river; they decided to do
something to save the river; they invited
Sarasvatī and found out from her the cause
of the disturbed condition of the तीर्थ
(कारणं ब्रूहि कल्याणि किमर्थं ते
ह्रदो ह्य् अयम्।एवम् आकुलतां यातः
9. 42. 9); on hearing the cause, they decided
to free the river from the curse; by their
mere word Sarasvatī returned to her normal
condition and her water was as placid as
before (तेषां तु वचनाद् एव प्रकृतिस्था
सरस्वती।प्रसन्नसलिला जज्ञे यथा पूर्-
वम् तथैव हि 9. 42. 13); the excellent river
shone as before; since the river water was
normal again the Rākṣasas were afflicted by
hunger and they requested the sages to relieve
them from that condition; the sages praised
the river and urged her to relieve the Rākṣasas
from their condition; knowing what the sages
wanted Sarasvatī brought to her current the
river Aruṇā (अरुणाम् आनयाम् आस स्वां
तनुम्); bathing in that river the Rākṣasas
abandoned their bodies and went to heaven
9. 42. 1-25; (12) While Dadhīca was
giving offerings to gods on the bank of Saras-
vatī (तस्य तर्पयतो देवान् सरस्वत्याम्
9. 50. 8), the Apsaras Alambusā, sent by
Indra to disturb the austerities of Dadhīca,
approached him; seeing her divine form the
seed of Dadhīca spilled into water of Sara-
svatī; the river held it in her womb as she
desired to have a son and also because the seed
might not be wasted (कुक्षौ चाप्य् अदधत् …
तद् रेतः … पुत्रहेतोर् महानदी 9. 50. 10;
न विनाशम् इदं गच्छेत् त्वत्तेज इति निश्च-
यात् 9. 50. 14); when Sarasvatī delivered the
child at proper time she took him to Dadhīca;
seeing Dadhīca seated in the assembly of
sages she handed over the child to him saying
it was his son whom she bore out of her
devotion to the sage (ब्रह्मर्षे तव पुत्रो
ऽयं त्वद्भक्त्या धारितो मया 9. 50. 12);
Dadhīca accepted the child and was very much
delighted; he then gave the following boon
to Sarasvatī: “all gods, manes, Gandharvas
and Apsarases will be satisfied when they
receive offerings of your water (तृप्तिं या-
स्यन्ति सुभगे तर्प्यमाणास् तवाम्भसा 9.
50. 17); the sage then praised the great river
(9. 50. 19-20); he declared that this her
son will be known as Sārasvata after the
mother's name (तवैव नाम्ना प्रथितः
पुत्रस् ते लोकभावनः 9. 50. 21); he also
declared that by his grace Sarasvatī would
be the holiest of all holy rivers (पुण्याभ्यश्
च सरिद्भ्यस् त्वं सदा पुण्यतमा शुभे।
भविष्यसि महाभागे मत्प्रसादात् सरस्-
वति 9. 50. 23); when praised by the sage and
having received a boon from him Sarasvatī
went away taking her son with her 9. 50.
5-24; (13) Once there was drought lasting
for twelve years; when Sārasvata, like other
people, wanted to leave the place and go else-
where in search of food, Sarasvatī told him
not to leave the place; she assured him to
provide food to him in the form of excellent
fish; Sārasvata therefore lived there; he ate
the food offered by the river and preserved the
Vedas 9. 50. 36-38; (14) Bharata, son of
Duḥṣyanta and Śakuntalā, bound twenty
horses for sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī
(सरस्वतीं विंशतिं च) 12. 29. 41; (15)
Gārgya satisfied Śiva by offering a mental
sacrifice on the bank of Sarasvatī (सर्स्वत्यास्
तटे तुष्टो मनोयज्ञेन पाण्डव); Śiva
then gave him wonderful knowledge of time
(कालज्ञानं ममाद्भुतम्), a thousand
sons, equal to Gārgya, versed in the exposition
of Brahman (तुल्यं मम सहस्रं तु
सुतानां ब्रह्मवादिनाम्), and very long
life to him and to his sons 13. 18. 25-26;
(16) Nahuṣa invited Agastya, who was
then on the bank of Sarasvatī, to come to
him and draw his carriage (वाहनायाजुहाव
सः।द्रुतं सरस्वतीकूलात्) 13. 103. 12;
(17) Utathya, angered at the abduction
of his wife by Varuṇa, began to drink up
water everywhere, compelled the ocean to
recede and asked Sarasvatī: “Be invisible
in a desert land; when deserted by you let
the land be unholy” (अदृश्या गच्छ भीरु
त्वं सरस्वति मरुं प्रति।अपुण्य एष
भवतु देशस् त्यक्तस् त्वया शुभे) 13. 139.
25-26; (18) Sarasvatī was one of the rivers
seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly of the Bāla
(3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187. 3) 3. 186.
96; (19) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana
the origin of the Saptasārasvata tīrtha;
Vaiśaṃpāyana then began the narration of
a past event in which Sarasvatī, when invited
for a sacrifice at different places, appeared
there under different names 9. 37. 1, 3-4; (i)
When Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) thought of
Sarasvatī she first appeared as Suprabhā at
Puṣkara to make the sacrifice of Pitāmaha
on this earth highly fruitful (महाफलः);
Sarasvatī thus showed her respect for Pitāmaha
(पितामहं मानयन्तीम्) 9. 37. 11-14;
(ii) When Sarasvatī was thought of by the
sages performing a सत्र at Naimiṣa forest
she appeared there as Kāñcanākṣī to help the
sages (सहायार्थं महात्मनाम्); she was
honoured by the sages (पूजिता) 9. 37. 15-18;
(iii) When she appeared for the sacrifice of
Gaya among the people of Gayā (गयेषु),
sages called her Viśālā 9. 37. 20; (iv) In
the sacrifice of Auddālaki in the northern Ko-
salas when she was thought of by Auddālaka
the river appeared there for him (आजगाम
सरिच्छ्रेठा तं देशम् ऋषिकारणात्) under
the name Manohradā (Mānasahradā in 9. 37.
4) since she was carried there by the sages
through the agency of their mind (सा हि
तैर् मनसा हृता); the river was honoured
there by the sages (पूज्यमाना मुनिगणैः)
9. 37. 21-23; (v) In the Ṛṣabhadvīpa the
river appeared with the name Suveṇu 9. 37.
24; (vi) In the sacrifice of Kuru at
Kurukṣetra. when invoked by Vasiṣṭha, the
river Sarasvatī appeared with the name Ogha-
vatī 9. 37. 24-25; (vii) In the sacrifice
of Dakṣa at Gaṅgādvāra the river appear-
ed as Vimalodā 9. 37. 26 (Vimalodakā
9. 37. 4); when Brahman offered a sacri-
fice again he called the river back on the
Himavant mountain; the तीर्थ where all
the seven forms of the river got united
became famous as Saptasārasvata 9. 37. 26-
28; (20) When the chariot of Śiva was
got ready for his fight with Asuras fighting
from the Tripuras the Mahānadīs became
its hind parts (जङ्घास् तस्य महानदीः)
8. 24. 69 (Sarasvatī could be one of these
‘big rivers’; but cf. the next); (21) Saras-
vatī was the परिरथ्य (?) of Śiva's
chariot 8. 24. 75 (however, according to Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 8. 34. 34, सरस्वती here
means speech: परिरथ्या प्रचारमार्गः।
सरस्वती वाग्देवीकल्पितः शब्दमात्रशरीर
इत्य् अर्थः); (22) When Hari resorted to
another body with the head of a horse for
the rescue of the Vedas, Gaṅgā and Sarasvatī
became his two eyebrows (गङ्गा सरस्वती
पुण्या भ्रुवाव् आस्तां महानदी) 12. 335.
46; (23) The gods, led by Brahman, took
with them Skanda and went to Himavant
and the river Sarasvatī for his consecration
as the general of their army 9. 43. 50-52;
they consecrated Skanda at Sthāṇutīrtha on
Sarasvatī 9. 41. 6-7; gods consecrated Skanda
as their general with the holy waters of Saras-
vatī having heavenly waters (सरस्वतीभिः
पुण्याभिर् दिव्यतोयाभिर् एव तु।अभ्यषिञ्चन्
कुमारं वै) 9. 44. 18-19; (24) Dakṣa
told gods that the emaciated Soma (moon)
would grow again after bathing in the exce-
llent तीर्थ on Sarasvatī (सरस्वत्या वरे
तीर्थे उन्मज्जन् शशलक्षणः।पुनर्
वर्धिष्यते देवाः); Soma then proceeded
to the great तीर्थ Prabāsa on Sarasvatī
9. 34. 67, 69; (25) Sthāṇu (Śiva) offered
a sacrifice and honoured Sarasvatī and then
established Sthāṇutīrtha on the river 9. 41. 8;
(26) When Indra was pursued by the head
of Namuci, Pitāmaha (Brahman) asked Indra
to offer a sacrifice and to bathe in Aruṇā;
Indra then offered a sacrifice in the Kuñja of
Sarasvatī and bathed in Aruṇā (सरस्वत्याः
कुञ्जे … इष्ट्वा … अरुणायाम् उपास्पृशत्)
9. 42. 34-35; (27) At the तीर्थ (not
named) situated near the आश्रम of Baka
Dālbhya on the river Sarasvatī (9. 39. 32;
9. 40. 1) Bṛhaspati gave offerings of flesh
for the prosperity of gods and the decline of
Asuras (असुराणाम् अभावाय भावाय च
दिवौकसाम्) 9. 40. 26-27; (28) Sarasvatī
was one of the rivers whom Umā wanted to
consult on स्त्रीधर्म before expounding
it to Śiva as these rivers were well-versed
in it; Umā thereby wanted to honour the
rivers; the rivers appointed Gaṅgā to speak
on their behalf to Umā 13. 134. 13, 19-22,
25.
G. Importance: (1) One of the rivers
who wait upon Varuṇa in his Sabhā (उपा-
सते महात्मानम्) 2. 9. 19, 22; (2) Men-
tioned twice in the Daivata-Ṛṣi-Vaṃśa reci-
ted by Bhīṣma 13. 151. 14, 22, (2).
H.
Simile: Draupadī having five Pāṇḍavas as
her husbands was very happy with them and
they with Draupadī as is Sarasvatī with the
Nāgas (बभूव परमप्रीता नागैर् इव
सरस्वती) 1. 205. 3 (Nī. on 1. 213. 3:
नागैर् गजैः; he, however, adds: सरस्वती
बहुसरोयुक्ता वनस्थली।सा हि गजैर्

Bhṛgu approached Himavant and asked for

the former uttered a curse that the mountain
would not be a source of jewels; that word

like the sun; Śuka told his father all about
his conversation with Janaka 12. 314. 25-29;
when Śuka got the consent of Nārada to leave

father 12. 318. 60-61, 63; Śuka went up
to the summit of Himavant and sat there
on a desolate table-land (गिरिपृष्ठं समा-
रुह्य … समे देशे विविक्ते च … उपाविशत्);
taking recourse to Yoga he went beyond the
sky to reach the path of liberation (स पुनर्
योगम् आस्थाय मोक्षमार्गोपलब्धये।
महायोगीश्वरो भूत्वा सो ऽत्यक्रामद् विहा-
यसम्॥) 12. 319. 1, 6; when Śuka attained
perfection (सिद्धि) and was established in
ब्रह्मन् (ब्रह्मणि प्रत्यतिष्ठत् सः)
some unexpected things happened; one of
them was that it appeared due to loud
thunders that Himavant was being torn
asunder (निर्घातशब्दैश् च गिरिर् हिम्-
अवान् दीर्यतीव ह) 12. 320. 5; he then
saw before him towards the north two hea-
venly summits closely attached to each other,
one of Himavant, white and silvery, and the
other of Meru, yellow and golden; the two
peaks were a hundred योजनस् in height and
width (शृङ्गे … हिमवन्मेरुसंभवे।सं-
श्लिष्टे श्वेतपीते द्वे रुक्मरूप्यमये शुभे॥
शतयोजनविस्तारे तिर्यग् ऊर्ध्वं च भा-
रत।उदीचीं दिशम् आश्रित्य) 12. 320. 8-9;
undeterred Śuka continued to fly upwards:
then a wonderful thing happened—the two
peaks suddenly got separated and Śuka swiftly
passed through them; the excellent mountain
(Himavant ? Meru ?) could not check Śuka's
gait; those who lived in heaven and on the
mountain uttered a loud cry (ततः पर्वत-
शृङ्गे द्वे सहसैव द्विधाकृते।अदृश्य-
तां महाराज तद् अद्भुतम् इवाभवत्॥
ततः पर्वतशृण्गाभ्यां सहसैव विनिः-
सृतः।न च प्रतिजघानास्य स गतिं
पर्वतोत्तमः॥) 12. 320. 10-12; Vyāsa who
followed Śuka saw his son pass through the
mountain peak rent into two (द्विधा कृत्वा
पर्वताग्रम्) 12. 320. 21; Vyāsa then sat
down on the summit of the mountain (गिरि-
प्रस्थे) thinking continuously of his son
(पुत्रम् एवानुचिन्तयन्) 12. 320. 27; (18)
A certain Brāhmaṇa, son of Pippalāda and
of Kuśika gotra, lived at the foot of Hima-
vant engaged in Vedic studies (ब्राह्मणो
जापकः कश्चित् … पैप्पलादिः स कौशिकः।
 … हिमवत्पादसंश्रयः) 12. 192. 4-5
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 199. 4: जापकः
मन्त्राध्ययनपरः); (19) A certain
Śūdra approached the head of an आश्रम of
the Brāhmaṇas on Himavant (ब्रह्माश्र-
मपदे वृत्तं पार्श्वे हिमवतः शुभे) 13.
10. 5, 10 (the आश्रम described 13. 10. 6-9);
(20) An owl named Prākārakarṇa lived on
Himavant; Indradyumna became a horse and
carried Mārkaṇḍeya to the owl on the distant
Himavant (प्रकृष्टे चाध्वनि हिमवान्) 3.
191. 4-5; (21) A lotus pond on Himavant
(हिमवतः … कमलाकरः) waited in per-
son (साक्षात्) on the brahmanical sage Jīmūta
5. 109. 21; (22) Gaṅgā, unable to bear
the seed (emitted lustre of Maheśvara तेजो
माहेश्वरं स्कन्नम् 9. 43. 6) placed in her
by Agni, released it on Himavant (उत्ससर्ज
गिरौ रम्ये हिमवति); there it grew and
was seen by the Kṛṭṭikās in a cluster of reeds
9. 43. 9-11; Nārada went to see Himavant
where Kumāra (Skanda) in his childhood
threw his शक्ति on earth; he challenged any
one to uproot or shake the शक्ति (हिमवन्तम्
इयाद् द्रष्टुम् … ।यत्रैव च कुमारेण …
शक्तिर् न्यस्ता क्षितितले) 12. 314. 3, 7-10;
Prahlāda in his effort to draw out the शक्ति
fainted on the summit of the mountain
(मूर्च्छितो गिरिमूर्धनि) 12. 314. 16-17;
gods, led by Brahman, took Kumāra
to the best mountain (Himavant), to
Sarasvatī of Himavant for his coronation
(अभिषेकार्थम् आजग्मुः शैलेन्द्रम् … ।
हैमवतीम् … सरस्वतीम्) 9. 43. 50-51;
Himavant present at the time of the corona-
tion 9. 44. 13; he gave for coronation an
excellent, divine seat decorated with excellent
gems and heavenly jewels (हिमवता दत्ते
 … निषण्णः परमासने) 9. 44. 2; after
the coronation, Himavant gave to Kumāra
as his attendants (अनुचरौ) Suvarcas and
Ativarcas 9. 44. 42; Skanda, while shoot-
ing arrows at Śveta mountain, pierced
Krauñca mountain, the son of Himavant
(बिभेद स शरैः शैलं क्रौञ्चं हिम-
वतः सुतम्); through the hole created by
him swans and vultures go to Meru 3. 214. 31;
(23) Śiva went from Kailāsa to Himavant
(हिमवन्तम् उपागमत्) to hold Gaṅgā on
his head when the river descended from the
sky (महादेवः शिरसा यां अधारयत्)
3. 108. 3; (हिमवति गङ्गायाः … ।मूर्ध्ना
धारां महादेवः शिरसा याम् अधारयत्)
13. 106. 26; (24) Rudra desired Umā,
daughter of Himavant (हिमवतो गिरेर्
दुहितरम् उमां रुद्रश् चकमे) 12. 329.
49(1); Umā practised on a spot on Hima-
vant severe austerities for Śiva and hence it
is said that the spot was liked by both of
them (तत्र (i. e. इष्टं किल गिरौ स्थानम्)
देव्या तपस् तप्तं शंकरार्थम् … ।अतस्
तद् इष्टं देवस्य तथोमाया इति श्रुतिः)
13. 19. 20; (25) Śiva always went to the
northern side of Himavant (यत्रोत्तरां दिशं
गत्वा शैलराजस्य पार्श्वतः) to practise
austerities 12. 314. 18; when Śiva practised
austerities on Himavant (गिरितटे 13. 127.
17), the mountain shone due to Śiva's auste-
rites (स गिरिस् तपसा तस्य भूतेशस्य
व्यरोचत) 13. 127. 2, 10; Umā also resorted
to that place on Himavant (सेवन्ती हिम-
वत्पार्श्वम्) and approached Śiva 13. 127.
25; when she closed the eyes of Śiva with her
hands a big flame issued from his forehead;
the mountain was afflicted by Śiva's third
eye which looked like the sun (येनासौ
मथितो गिरिः) 13. 127. 29-30, 45, (मथितं
शैलम्) 36; the flame burnt the whole forest
on Himavant; hence the animals came to
Śiva's abode for shelter; the entire mountain
Himavant, with its peaks full of minerals and
herbs in its forests, was burnt in a moment
(क्षणेन तेन दग्धः स हिमवान् अभवन्
नगः।सधातुशिखराभोगो दीनदग्ध-
वनौषधिः॥); when Śiva noticed that Umā
was unhappy due to the wretched condition
of her father, he looked with affection at the
mountain and it returned to its former origi-
nal condition, beautiful to look at (शर्वः
 … प्रीत्यापश्यत् ततो गिरिम्।ततो ऽभवत्
पुनः सर्वः प्रकृतिस्थः सुदर्शनः)
13. 127. 32-39, 42, 45; (26) The marriage
of Rudra with Rudrāṇī took place on Hima-
vant (गिरौ हिमवति श्रेष्ठे) 13. 83. 40;

rities to beget a son on Jāmbavatī; Tārkṣya
took Kṛṣṇa to Himavant (अहं तार्क्ष्यम्
अचिन्तयम्।सो ऽवहद् धिमवन्तं माम्)
13. 14. 12-13, 26; Kṛṣṇa saw on Himavant
miraculous occurrences (तत्राहम् अद्भुतान्
भावान् अपश्यं गिरिसत्तमे) 13. 14. 27;
Kṛṣṇa observed a व्रत, lasting for twelve
years on Himavant (व्रतं चर्तुम् इहायातस्
त्व् अहं गिरिम् इमं शुभम्) 13. 126. 10, 33;
the unthinkable miracle of fire issuing from
the mouth of Kṛṣṇa (13. 126. 16) witnessed
by Nārada and other sages on Himavant
(यद् आश्चर्यं अचिन्त्यं च गिरौ हिम-
वति प्रभो।अनुभूतं मुनिगणैः) 13.
126. 48-49; the fire burnt the mountain with
its trees, creepers and bushes, as well as
all kinds of animals; the summit of the
mountain was afflicted (शिखरं तस्य शै-
लस्य मथितम्) 13. 126. 17-18; (एतद्
तद् वैष्णवं तेजो मम वक्त्राद् विनिः-
सृतम्। … येनायं मथितो गिरिः) 13. 126.
30; Viṣṇu by looking at the forest with gentle
eyes brought it back to its original condition
(सौम्यैर् दृष्टिनिपातैस् तत् पुनः प्रकृतिम्
आनयत् 13. 126. 20-21, 36; (28) When
Rudra and Nārāyaṇa fought with each other
the ocean went dry and Himavant was
shattered (हिमवांश् च व्यशीर्यत) 12.
330. 54; (29) Once, god Brahman waited
upon by brahmanical sages stayed on Hima-
vant (तदा हिमवतः पृष्ठे … तस्थौ)
12. 160. 31-32; (30) Indra saw a young
man (really god Śiva 1. 189. 21) playing
dice with a young woman on the summit of
the king of mountains (क्रीडन्तम् अक्षैर्
गिरिराजमूर्ध्नि); Śiva asked Indra to turn
(the summit of) the mountain and enter
it (विवर्तयैनं च महाद्रिराजम् … ।स
तद् विवृत्य शिखरं महागिरेः); when
Indra did what he was asked to do he saw
four former Indras, equal to him in lustre,
held captive there 1. 189. 14, 19-20; Śiva
asked Indra to enter the cave of the moun-
tain and stay there (दरीम् एतां प्रविश
त्वम् शतक्रतो … एतां दरिम् आविश्य शेध्-
वम्) 1. 189. 14, 19-24, 32; (31) Upaśruti

रं पार्श्वम् आगमत्।समुद्रं च समा-
साद्य … आससाद महाद्विपम्) 5. 14. 5-6;
(32) Mṛtyu, conceived as a woman, reluc-
tant to carry out the instruction of Pitāmaha
to deprive people of their lives, went to the
top of Himavant (हिमवतो मूर्ध्नि) and
stood there for an extremely long period
(निखर्वम् अपरं ततः।तस्थौ) on her
toe to satisfy Pitāmaha 12. 250. 23; (33)
Śeṣa, disgusted with the behaviour of his
stupid brothers, left his mother Kadrū and
went to different places to practise austerities,
one of them being the slope of Himavant
(हिमवतस् तटे) 1. 32. 2-3; (34) Nārada
told to Vāyu that a certain large Śālmali tree
grown on the summit of Himavant (हिम-
वत्पृष्ठजः) disrespected him 12. 151. 2.

(हिमाद्रिकूटः कुलिसाहतो यथा) 8. 13. 20;
(3) Summit of Himavant as an उपमान:
(a) Daṇḍa's elephant, white like snow and
wearing golden garlands, was the image of
the summit of Himavant (हिमावदातेन
सुवर्णमालिना हिमाद्रिकूटप्रतिमेन दन्-
तिना) 8. 13. 16; (द्विपं श्वेतनगाग्रसं-

assembled for Draupadī's स्वयंवर (यथा
हैमवता गजेन्द्राः) 1. 178. 2; (iii) Heroes
defeated by Arjuna slept like grown up
elephants from Himavant (नागा यथा हैम-
वताः प्रवृद्धाः) 4. 49. 15; (iv) (a)
Elephants from Himavant as उपमेय: The
elephants from Himavant with golden nets
hanging from their bodies looked like clouds
with lightnings (सुकल्पिता हैमवताः …
सुवर्णजालावतता बभुर् गजा तथा यथा
वै जलदाः सविद्युतः) 8. 62. 36; (b)
Lions: (i) Kuntī blessed Karṇa saying

rushed at Duḥśāsana as a lion from Hima-
vant rushes at a jackal (सिंहो यथा हैम-
वतः शृगालम्) 2. 68. 15; (iii) Bhīma,

cow-pen (गोवासम् इव … सिंहा हैमवता
यथा) 2. 19. 25; (c) Swans: (i) Horses

(ii) Thousands of horses hit by Arjuna's
arrows fell down like swans falling down on

water (हंसा हिमवतः पृष्ठे वारिविप्र-
हता इव) 7. 66. 19; (d) Kiṃśuka tree:
Bhīma and Duryodhana, wounded and smear-
ed with blood, looked like two Kiṃśuka trees
in blossom on Himavant (हिमवति पुष्पिताव्
इव किंशुकौ) 9. 57. 31; (e) A leaf: Indra,
humiliated, trembled as does a leaf of a fig
tree, stirred by wind, on the Himavant
summit (अनिलेनेव नुन्नम् अश्वत्थपत्रं
गिरिराजमूर्ध्नि) 1. 189. 22; (f) A cave:
A king is said to be like a cavern on Hima-
vant, inaccessible and difficult to enter (दुरा-
सदां दुष्प्रवेशां गुहां हैमवतीम्
इव) 12. 83. 39. (6) Vyāsa surrounded by
his pupils and his son at the foot of Himavant
looked like the lord of the Bhūtas (Śiva) sur-
rounded by Bhūtas (शुशुभे हिमवत्पादे
भूतैर् भूतपतिर् यथा) 12. 337. 12; (7)
Himavant an उपमेय: Himavant without
the sound of the recitation of the Vedas did
not shine like moon when covered with dust
and darkness at the time of the eclipse or
like a habitation of the Niṣādas (ब्रह्मघो-
षैर् विरहितः पर्वतो ऽयं न शोभते।
रजसा तमसा चैव सोमः सोपप्लवो
यथा॥न भ्राजते यथापूर्वं निषादा-
नाम् इवालयः) 12. 315. 13-14.
I. Modes
of expression: These are based on various
characteristics of the mountain: (a) Stead-
iness: (i) Himavant might start moving
about, but Duḥśāsana would not rule
the earth without Duryodhana (हिमवांश्
च परिव्रजेत्। … न चाहं त्वद् ऋते राजन्
प्रशासेयं वसुन्धराम्) 3. 238. 31; (ii)
If Arjuna's words were to prove false
then, indeed, Himavant may move from its
place (चलेद् धि हिमवान् स्थानात् … मत्-
सत्यं विचलेद् यदि) 2. 68. 35; the same
said by Kṛṣṇa (चलेद् धि हिमवाञ् शैलो
 … न मे मोघं वचो भवेत्) 5. 80. 48;
(b) Solid form: (i) Kṛṣṇa to Draupadī:
Himavant may be shattered, but his words
would not be false (हिमवाञ् शीर्येत् … न मे
मोघं वचो भवेत्) 3. 13. 117; (ii)
Duryodhana to Dhṛtarāṣṭra: Even Himavant
would be shattered in a hundred thousand
ways if hit just once by Duryodhana with his
गदा (गदाप्रहाराभिहतो हिमवान् अपि
पर्वतः। … विशीर्येत गिरिः शतसहस्रधा)
5. 54. 38; (iii) Hearing Bhīma's loud roar
after the death of Jarāsaṃdha people wondered
if Himavant had split (किं नु स्विद् धिम-
वान् भिन्नः) 2. 22. 9; (c) Not subject
to reduction in size: Even Himavant would
decay under certain conditions (भक्ष्य-
माणो ह्य् अनावापः क्षीयते हिमवान् अपि) 3.
33. 9; (d) Not to be easily toppled down:
Himavant is one of the four mountains which
cannot be easily toppled down (हिमवान् …
चत्वारः पर्वताः केन पातिता भुवि तेजसा)
3. 297. 14; (e) Very large size: Bhīma
to Yudhiṣṭhira—Yudhiṣṭhira's wish to hide
Pāṇḍavas for a year was like trying to hide
Himavant with a handful of grass (तृणानां
मुष्टिनैकेन हिमवन्तं तु पर्वतम्।
छन्नम् इच्छसि कौन्तेय यो ऽस्मान् सं-
वर्तुम् इच्छसि) 3. 36. 22; (f) Strength:
Bhīma to Kṛṣṇa—even Himavant, ocean and
Indra together cannot rescue a person attack-
ed by Bhīma (हिमवांश् च समुद्रश् च
वज्री च … ।मयाभिपन्नं त्रायेरन् बलम्
आस्थाय न त्रयः) 5. 74. 10; (g) Impass-
ableness: One cannot say that the back side of
Himavant does not exist simply because men
have not seen it (यथा हिमवतः पृष्ठं
 … न दृष्टपूर्वं मनुजैर् न च तन् नास्ति
तावता) 12. 196. 6; (h) Mighty elephants
at its foot: Wishing to defeat Yudhiṣṭhira
was like driving away with a stick a huge ele-
phant in rut roaming at the foot of Himavant
with its herd (नागम् … उपत्यकां हैम-
वतीं चरन्तम्।दण्डीव यूथाद् अपसे-
धसे त्वं यो जेतुम् आशंससि धर्म-
राजम्॥) 3. 252. 5.
J. Relationships with
Himavant: (a) Daughters of Himavant:

गिरिः) 13. 26. 57; (d) General association:
Gandhamādana mountain called हैमवत
mountain 3. 157. 3.
K. Bad omen: The
falling down with great roar of thousands of

east and merge at both ends in the eastern
and the western oceans (प्रागायता महाराज
षद् एते रत्नपर्वताः।अवगाढा ह्य् उभ-
यतः समुद्रौ पूर्वपश्चिमौ) 6. 7. 2;
the distance between them is thousands of
योजनस् (तेषाम् अन्तरविष्कम्भो योजनानि
सहस्रशः) 6. 7. 4; it lies between Haima-
vatavarṣa and Harivarṣa; the Varṣa beyond
Hemakūṭa is Harivarṣa (इदं तु भारतं
वर्षं ततो हैमवतं परम्।हेमकूटात्
परं चैव हरिवर्षं प्रचक्षते) 6. 7.

listed by Saṃjaya are full of jewels (रत्न-
पर्वताः) 6. 7. 2 and resorted to by Siddhas
and Cāraṇas (सिद्धचारणसेविताः) 6. 7. 4.
C. Characteristics: (1) Many unthinkable
wonders happen on the mountain (अचिन्त्यान्
अद्भुतान् भावान् ददर्श सुबहून् नृपः);
spoken words turn into clouds and rocks by
thousands and hence people cannot climb it
(वाचो यत्राभवन् मेघा उपलाश् च सहस्र-
शः।नाशक्नुवंस् तम् आरोढुम् …
जनाः॥) 3. 109. 3; wind always blows there
and it rains continuously; the oblation bearing
god (Fire) can be seen there morning and
evening (वायुर् नित्यं ववौ यत्र नित्यं
देवश् च वर्षति।सायं प्रातश् च भग-
वान् दृश्यते हव्यवाहनः॥) 3. 109. 4; (2)
One cannot even look at this mountain, let
alone climb it; one who has not practised
austerities cannot look at it or climb it
(नाशक्नुवन्न् अभिद्रष्टुं कुत एवाधिरो-
हितुम्॥नातप्ततपसा शक्यो द्रष्टुम् एष
महागिरिः।आरोढुं वापि कौन्तेय) 3. 109.

vaṇa, along with the Guhyakas, enjoys him-
self there (यत्र वैश्रवणो राजा गुह्य-
कैः सह मोदते) 6. 7. 39.
D. Epic
event: Yudhiṣṭhira having reached Hemakūṭa
saw many wonders there 3. 109. 5; Lomaśa
gave to him the explanation of these
wonders 3. 109. 6-17 (see the next section);
he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to bathe in the
river Nandā flowing along the mountain
since a bath destroyed the sin instantly
3. 109. 18; he also asked him to restrain his
speech (नियतवाग् भव) 3. 109. 14.
E. Past
events: (1) An ascetic named Ṛṣabha
once lived on this mountain (hence called
Ṛṣabhakūṭa ?) and was practising austerities
for many hundred years (अनेकशतवर्षायुस्
तपस्वी); he got angry when he was drawn
into conversation by others; so he told the
mountain to release rocks if any one uttered
a word there; he summoned wind and bade
him not to make noise; hence if any one tried
to speak there he was restrained by a cloud
(स वै संभाष्यमाणो ऽन्यैः कोपाद् गिरिम्
उवाच ह।य इह व्याहरेत् कश्चिद् उपलान्
उत्सृजेस् तदा॥वातं चाहूय मा शब्दम्
इत्य् उवाच स तापसः।व्याहरंश् चैव
पुरुषो मेघेन विनिवार्यते॥) 3. 109.
7-9; (2) When gods formerly came to the
river Nandā (flowing near Hemakūṭa) men
followed there to see the gods; since the
gods, Indra and the rest, did not wish to be
seen by men they made the land inaccessible
making this mountain an obstacle (दुर्गं
चक्रुर् इमं देशं गिरिप्रत्यूहरूपकम्);
hence men cannot even look at the mountain,
let alone climb it; the gods then always per-
formed best sacrifices there; the signs of
those sacrifices could even now be seen in
the form of the sprawling दूर्वा grass having
the form of sacrificial grass (कुश) and many
trees having the shape of sacrificial posts
(यूप) (तेषाम् एतानि लिङ्गानि दृश्यन्ते ऽद्यापि
भारत॥कुशाकारेव दुर्वेयं … यूप-
प्रकारा बहवो वृक्षाश् चेमे॥) 3. 109.
11-16; (3) Hamakūṭa was one of the
mountains seen by Mārkaṇḍeya in the belly
of the Bāla (3. 186. 83 = Nārāyaṇa 3. 187.

अच्युतस्थल
Acyutasthala nt.: Name of a town.
A place in the Āraṭṭa (Bāhlīka) coun-
try; one who stays there (long) cannot go
to heaven; hence one should not stay there
for more than a day—this is what a Brāh-
maṇa told in the assembly of the Kurus
(यद् अन्यो ऽप्य् उक्तवान् सभ्यो ब्राह्मणः
कुरुसं सदि॥ … प्रोष्य चाप्य् अच्युतस्थले।
 … कथं स्वर्गं गमिष्यति॥ … आरट्टा
नाम बाह्लीका न तेष्व् आर्यो द्व्यहं वसेत्
॥) 8. 30. 41-43; the place also mentioned
in what a Piśācī said to a Brāhmaṇī (?)
who came to stay at Raupyā with her sons;
this was told by Lomaśa to Yudhiṣṭhira
when he wanted to recite the अनुवंश
stanzas about Raupyā; according to the
Piśācī no one who had stayed at Acyuta-
sthala was supposed to stay near Raupyā
for more than one night (अत्रानुवंशं
पठतः शृणु मे कुरुनन्दन। … पिशाची
यद् अभाषत। … उषित्वा चाच्युतस्थले। …
एकरात्रम् उषित्वेह द्वितीयां यदि वत्स्यसि।
एतद् वै ते दिवा वृत्तं रात्रौ वृत्तम् अतो
ऽन्यथा॥) 3. 129. 8-10; (according to the
प्राञ्चः, whose view is cited by Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 3. 129. 9, one could stay at Raupyā even
after staying at Acyutasthala if he had
performed the prescribed प्रायश्चित्त viz.
the प्राजापत्य व्रत; according to these
प्राञ्चः, Acyutasthala was the village where
people born of mixed marriages lived
(अच्युतस्थलाख्ये संकरजानां ग्रामे);
according to others, however, who under-
stood the word in good light, Acyutasthala
meant the subtle body (लिङ्गशरीर) and
उषित्वा meant by being near the सूत्रात्मन्
(सूत्रात्मानम् उपास्य)).

Yudhiṣṭhira had his residence on a beauti-
ful, auspicious spot; filled with wealth it

they settled down there, developed a liking
for the town (तेषां … राष्ट्रम् आवसतां …
पाण्डवानां … शश्वत् प्रीतिर् अवर्धत) 1.

Indra-like archers, shone like Bhogavatī with
the Nāgas (शुशुभे तत् पुरश्रेष्ठं नागैर्

of Indraprastha (एवं संप्राप्य राज्यं

marriage gifts to Arjuna 1. 213. 29; (this

Yādavas arrived, the city of Khāṇḍava-
prastha was gaily decorated with flags and
banners, its roads were swept and sprink-
led with water, flowers scattered all around,
cool and fragrant sandalwood juice was
abundantly used, and fragrant अगुरु burnt
at every place (विवेश खाण्डवप्रस्थं
पताकाध्वजशोभितम्।सिक्तसंमृष्टपन्-
थानं पुष्पप्रकरशोभितम्।चन्दनस्य
रसैः शीतैः पुण्यगन्धैर् निषेवितम्॥
दह्यतागुरुणा चैव देशे देशे सुगन्धिना)
1. 213. 31-33; (6) When the Yādavas

1. 213. 57; (7) Sairandhrī told Uttara
that Bṛhannaḍā was the charioteer of
Arjuna when he defeated all kinds of beings
at Khāṇḍavaprastha (अजयत् खाण्डव-
प्रस्थे) 4. 34. 15 (here Khāṇḍavaprastha
stands for Khāṇḍava forest); this feat of
Arjuna at Khāṇḍavaprastha (= Khāṇḍava
forest) also referred to by Kṛṣṇa in his
address to Duryodhana (अजयत् खाण्डव-
प्रस्थे) 5. 122. 52, and by Karṇa when
he spoke to Śalya (प्रस्थे ऽजयत् खाण्डवे
सव्यसाची) 8. 29. 18; (8) After a com-
fortable stay (सुखवास) at Khāṇḍava-

ed to him the wealth brought by him 2. 29.
18; (15) After the Rājasūya, when Dur-
yodhana visited the Mayasabhā in Indra-
prastha, the Pāṇḍavas laughed at Duryo-
dhana (Bhīṣma told this to Yudhiṣṭhira)
12. 124. 5 (reference to 2. 43. 7, 9); (16)
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Vidura to go to Khāṇ-
ḍavaprastha to invite Yudhiṣṭhira for a
game of dice 2. 45. 56; (17) At the end
of the first game of dice, Dhṛtarāṣṭra per-
mitted Yudhiṣṭhira to return to Khāṇḍva-
prastha 2. 65. 15; accordingly Yudhiṣṭhira,
with his brothers and Draupadī, left for
Indraprastha 2. 65. 17; (18) The bright
prosperity (at the time of Rājasūya) of
Yudhiṣṭhira while he was ruling at Indrapra-
stha (इन्द्रप्रस्थगते … युधिष्ठिरे) was
snatched away from him by Duryodhana in
the game of dice (Karṇa told Duryodhana)
3. 226. 5-6; (19) People lamented when
Yudhiṣṭhira had to leave for the forest
leaving behind the great city Śatakratu-
prastha founded by himself (स्वयं निवेश्य
 … पुरं महत् … शतक्रतुप्रस्थम् …
हित्वा प्रयातः क्व नु धर्मराजः) 3. 24.
11; (20) Kṛṣṇa had assured Yudhiṣṭhira
when he met him in the forest that he
(Kṛṣṇa) could kill the Kauravas and get
back for him his prosperity which he had
seen at Indraprastha at the time of Rāja-
sūya (and of which he was now deprived)
3. 48. 17, 23; (21) Duryodhana re-
minded Dhṛtarāṣṭra that when Kṛṣṇa and
the other kings met the Pāṇḍavas in the
forest, at a place not far from Indraprastha
(वनं प्रव्राजितान् पार्थान् … इन्द्रप्रस्थ-
स्य चादूरात् समाजग्मुः), they blamed
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the other Kauravas 5. 54.
2, 4; (22) Aśvatthāman asked Karṇa in
derision in which battle did he (Karṇa)
win Indraprastha from the Pāṇḍavas; now
Karṇa should fight with Arjuna (at the time
of the cow raid at Virāṭanagara) since he
was responsible for the game of dice and for
winning Indraprastha 4. 45. 10, 21; (23)
Yudhiṣṭhira told Saṃjaya “Let Suyodhana
recognize my kingship at Indraprastha and
I shall be at peace with the Kauravas”
(शान्तिं गमिष्यामि यथा त्वम् आत्थ।इन्द्र-
प्रस्थे भवतु ममैव राज्यं सुयोधनो
यच्छतु भारताग्र्यः॥) 5. 26. 28; he
again asked Saṃjaya to tell Duryodhana:
“Hand over Śakrapura to me or get
ready for battle” (ददस्व वा शक्रपुरं
ममैव युध्यस्व वा भारतमुख्य
वीर॥) 5. 30. 47; Bhīṣma, after he fell on
the battlefield, also advised to hand over
half of the kingdom to the Pāṇḍavas and
let Yudhiṣṭhira rule at Indraprastha (रा-
ज्यस्यार्धं दीयतां पाण्डवानाम् इन्द्र-
प्रस्थं धर्मराजो ऽनुशास्तु) 6. 116; 48.
(24) Kṛṣṇa reminded Dhṛtarāṣṭra that he
himself and his sons had sent away Yudhi-
ṣṭhira to Indraprastha (इन्द्रप्रस्थं त्व-
यैवासौ सपुत्रेण विवासितः), where he
(Yudhiṣṭhira) brought under control other

जस्य शुशुभे भरतर्षभ॥) 4. 67. 38;
(3) When the Pāṇḍavas were settled in
Upaplavya (उपप्लव्ये निविष्टेषु पाण्डवेषु),
Duryodhana from Hāstinapura and Arjuna
from Upaplavya went independently to see
Vāsudeva to seek his help in the battle
as they wished to win victory 1. 2. 136 (this
is mentioned in the contents of the Udyoga-
parvan which is a reference to 5. 7. 2-20);

ing Śalya and in extracting a promise from
him to fight from his side, the latter went to
Upaplavya to report to the Pāṇḍavas what
had happened 5. 8. 15; (5) When Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra was informed that the Pāṇḍavas had
resorted to Upaplavya, he sent Saṃjaya

प्लव्ये) 5. 22. 1; 5. 22. 36; Saṃjaya, ac-
cordingly, went to Upaplavya to meet the
Pāṇḍavas (उपप्लव्यं ययौ द्रष्टुम्) 5.
23. 1; (6) Janārdana went from Upaplavya
to Hāstinapura to negotiate peace with
the Kauravas: on way he had encamped
at Vṛkasthala (उपप्लव्याद् इह … उपयातो
जनार्दनः।वृकस्थले निवसति) 5. 84. 1;
(उपप्लव्याच् छान्तिम् इच्छञ् जनार्दनः।
आगतः) 7. 61. 21; on Kṛṣṇa's way from
Upaplavya to Hāstinapura people gathered
in different towns to see him 5. 82. 18;
Kṛṣṇa, without achieving his purpose,
returned to Upaplavya when the sun
arose (उच्चैःसूर्यम्) and reported to the
Pāṇḍavas what happened at Hāstinapura
5. 135. 30; 5. 145. 1; (यदैवाकृतकार्यस्
त्वम् उपप्लव्यं गतः पुनः) 11. 25. 31;
(स गत्वा हास्तिनपुरं धृतराष्ट्रम् सम्-
एत्य च … ।अनवाप्य शमं तत्र कृष्णः … ।
आगच्छत महाबाहुर् उपप्लव्यम् … ॥) 9.
34. 5-7; (7) When Kṛṣṇa arrived at Upa-
plavya, Yudhiṣṭhira offered him मधुपर्क
and requested him to protect Arjuna in the
battle (उपयातम् उपप्लव्यम् … एष भ्राता
सखा चैव तव कृष्ण धनंजयः।
रक्षितव्यो महाबाहो सर्वास्व् आपत्स्व् इति
प्रभो॥) 9. 61. 23-24 (No such specific
request is reported earlier in the Udyoga-
parvan; a general request by Yudhiṣṭhira to
protect all the Pāṇḍavas is, however, repor-
ted at 5. 70. 4); (8) While at Upaplavya,
Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana had assured Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that victory would be on that side
which was helped by Kṛṣṇa (यतः कृष्णस्
ततो जयः) 9. 61. 30; (such a statement
by Vyāsa is not found earlier in the Ud-
yogaparvan; however, such statement was
made by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtaraṣṭra in Hāstina-
pura 5. 66. 9 and by Nārada to Arjuna
6. 21. 12, 14; what Vyāsa told Dhṛtarāṣṭra
was यतो धर्मस् ततो जयः 6. 2. 14;
(9) Kṛṣṇa, along with the Pāṇḍavas, left
Upaplavya for Kurukṣetra 9. 34. 14; when
the Pāṇḍavas with their army started for the
battlefield, Draupadī returned to Upapla-
vya; before leaving, the Pāṇḍavas made
arrangements for the defence of their base at
Upaplavya by erecting forts and stationing
troops all around (उपप्लव्ये तु पाञ्चाली
 … निववृते) 5. 149. 55; (कृत्वा मूलप्रती-
कारान् गुल्मैः स्थावरजङ्गमैः) 5. 149.
56 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 151. 61: मूलप्रती-
कारं धनदाररक्षां गुल्मैः स्थावरैः
प्राकाररूपैः जङ्गमैः परितः स्थाने
स्थाने शूरसङ्घैः); (10) Balarāma did
not agree to Kṛṣṇa's request to him to
help the Pāṇḍavas in the battle and left
from Upaplavya for a pilgrimage 9. 34. 10-
12; (11) During the battle Kṛṣṇa, at one
stage, in order to encourage Yudhiṣṭhira
reminded him that Arjuna had taken the
vow at Upaplavya to bring about the down-
fall of Bhīṣma (प्रतिज्ञातम् उपप्लव्ये यत्
तत् पार्थेन … घातयिष्यामि गाङ्गेयम्) 6.
103. 35 (a reference to 5. 160. 8, 12, 13; 5,
162. 1); (12) At the end of the war Nakula
went to fetch Draupadī who was at Upa-
plavya; she was afflicted when she heard the
extremely sad news about the destruction of
all her sons (उपप्लव्यगता सा तु श्रुत्वा
सुमहद् अप्रियम्) 10. 11. 4-5; she taunt-
ingly said to Arjuna that while living with
her at Upaplavya he would happily forget
his sons who were slain rightfully (in battle)
(आत्मजांस् तेन धर्मेण श्रुत्वा शूरान्
निपातितान्।उपप्लव्ये मया सार्धं दिष्ट्या
त्वं न स्मरिष्यसि) 10. 11. 12; (13) A cer-
tain Brāhmaṇa, observing vows, after seeing
Uttarā at Upaplavya had foretold that when
the Kurus were destroyed (परिक्षीण) a
son would be born to her; the child thus
would have the nature परिक्षित् while he
was still in the womb (विराटस्य सुताम् … ।
उपप्लव्यगतां दृष्ट्वा व्रतवान् ब्राह्मणो
ऽब्रवीत्॥परिक्षिणेषु कुरुषु पुत्रस् तव
जनिष्यति।एतद् अस्य परिक्षित्त्वम् गर्भस्-

पुर (वापी भवतु नः पुरे); if any
demon, wounded by weapons, was thrown
into this well, he arose from it stronger;
if a dead demon was thrown into it, he
came back alive (मृतानां जीवनीम्); forti-
fied with this well the denizens of the
Tripuras oppressed all the three worlds
8. 24. 23-27.
D. Mythological event:

puras, although he used all his weapons
against them, gods approached Rudra and
requested him to destroy the demons and
their cities; Śiva then burnt the three पुरस्
together with the demons, using gods as
chariot (देवान् रथवरम् कृत्वा), god
Viṣṇu as arrow, Agni as tip of the arrow
(शल्य), Yama as hind part of the arrow
(पुङ्ख); Śiva's arrow had three joints
and three heads (to correspond to the
three पुरस् ?) (त्रिपर्वणा त्रिशल्येन …

was driven in the direction of the Tripuras
by Pitāmaha; Śiva employed his Pāśupata
missile on his bow and thought of the
Tripuras (त्रिपुरं समचिन्तयत्) 8. 24.
115; at the appointed time the three पुरस्
came together and were united; when they
came in his view, Śiva shot his arrow which
burnt the Tripuras and the demons in them
and threw them in the western ocean; thus
Maheśvara, wishing well for the three
worlds, burnt the Tripuras and the demons
8. 24. 114-121; this report in the Karṇa-
parvan of the downfall of the Tripuras
which was according to the account in the

(तथैव दुर्गसंस्कारं देवैर् अपि दुरा-
सदम्॥स्त्रियो ऽपि यस्यां युध्येयुः
किं पुनर् वृष्णिपुंगवाः) 2. 13. 50-51.
D. Epic events: (1) The Yādavas fled to
the west from Mathurā due to fear of
Jarāsandha and repaired to Kuśasthalī;
they settled down there and fortified the
town; they lived in Kuśasthalī without fear
from any quarter (अकुतोभयाः); seeing
the mountain (Raivataka) nearby and the
Mādhavītīrtha, the Yādavas were highly
delighted 2. 13. 49-52, 65; hence the city is
referred to as the residence of the Yāda-
vas (यदुसदन) 8. 26. 63; (2) Hearing
that Śiśupāla was killed by Kṛṣṇa, Śālva,
during the absence of Kṛṣṇa from Dvā-
rakā, attacked the city riding in his Saubha
town; he killed young Vṛṣṇi heroes who
defended the city and destroyed all gardens
(पुरोद्यानानि सर्वाणि भेदयाम् आस दुर्म-
तिः) 3. 15. 5-7; hearing that Śrautaśrava
(Śiśupāla) was killed, Śālva besieged Dvāra-
vatī from all sides; he mounted his Saubha,
flying in the sky, and from there attacked
the city; the fortification and the defence
arrangements of the city were looked after
by Gada, Sāmba, Uddhava and others
according to the rules laid down in the
Śāstras (शास्त्रदृष्टेन विधिना संयूक्ता);
drinking liquor was forbidden in the town
to avoid negligence on the part of citizens
(आघोषितं च नगरे न पातव्या सुरेति ह।
प्रमादं परिरक्षद्भिः) 3. 16. 2-18;
Dvārakā was well guarded by king Āhuka by
giving largesses (द्वारका भूरिदक्षिणैः।
आहुकेन सुगुप्ता च राज्ञा) 3. 16. 23; Śālva
attacked Dvārakā with the speed of the king
of birds (अभिसारयाम् आस तदा वेगेन पत-
गेन्द्रवत्) 3. 17. 7; all the people in Dvārakā
were bewildered when Śālva descended on
the earth with his Saubha (सौभस्थं
पृथिवीगतम्) 3. 17. 28; when Śālva was
defeated by the Vṛṣṇis led by Pradyumna
he left Dvārakā mounting his Saubha 3.
20. 27; (3) At the end of the Rājasūya
Kṛṣṇa wished to return to Dvārakā 2. 42.
46, 52; Yudhiṣṭhira approved of Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvāravatī 2. 42. 49; when Kṛṣṇa
returned to Ānartanagara after the Rāja-
sūya of Yudhiṣṭhira at Indraprastha he saw
Dvārakā lack-lustre; it was bereft of the
sound of Vedic studies and Vedic sacrifices
(आनर्तनगरं मुक्तं ततो ऽहम् अगमं
तदा।महाक्रतौ राजसूये निवृत्ते … ॥
अपश्यं द्वारकां चाहं महाराज हत-
त्विषम्।निःस्वाध्यायवषट्कारम्); noble
women of the town did not put on orna-
ments; the gardens of Dvārakā were chang-
ed beyond recognition (अनभिज्ञेयरूपाणी
द्वारकोपवनानी च); Kṛṣṇa found Vṛṣṇi-
pura with its men and women very much
ill at ease (अस्वस्थनरनारीकम् इदं वृष्णि-
पुरं भृशम्); the siege of Dvārakā by
Śālva and lifting of the siege later by him
was reported to Kṛṣṇa; enraged, he asked
the Yādava heroes to be watchful in the
city (अप्रमादः सदा कार्यो नगरे याद-
वर्षभाः) and left for the destruction of
Śālva; he vowed not to return to Dvāravatī
without killing Śālva (नाहत्वा तं निवर्-
तिष्ये पुरीं द्वारवतीं प्रति) 3. 21. 1-9;
he asked Sātyaki, Baladeva, and Pradyumna
to protect Dvārakā and his father Vasudeva
3. 22. 16-17; during the fight with Śālva,
a certain resident of Dvārakā (पुरुषः
कश्चिद् द्वारकानिलयः), a servant (परि-
चारकः) of Āhuka, met Kṛṣṇa and gave
him a false message from Āhuka; accord-
ing to the message Śālva had attacked
Dvārakā and killed the son of Śūrasena
(Vasudeva); hence Kṛṣṇa was advised to
leave the battle, return to Dvārakā and
protect it; that should be Kṛṣṇa's prime
concern (द्वारकाम् एव रक्षस्व कार्यम्
एतन् महत् तव) 3. 22. 12-14; Kṛṣṇa then
mentally blamed Sātyaki and others who
were entrusted with the protection of Dvā-
rakā and of Vasudeva 3. 22. 16-17; (Kṛṣṇa,
however, soon realized that he was tricked
by Śālva by his माया and started to fight
with him again); he was incited to action
by his charioteer who reminded him that
Dvārakā was ransacked by Śālva (द्वारका
चावमर्दिता) 3. 23. 25; (4) Kṛṣṇa told
Yudhiṣṭhira that he was not in Dvārakā
when the game of dice was played in Hās-
tinapura 3. 14. 1; he heard of the द्यूत
only when he returned to Dvārakā after
vanquishing Śālva 3. 14. 15; (5) After
informing Yudhiṣṭhira in the forest about
Śālva's attacking Dvārakā and Kṛṣṇa's sub-
sequent battle with him, he comforted Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and returned to Dvārakā 3. 23. 42-45;
(6) Dvārakā was once burnt by Śiśupāla
when Kṛṣṇa and others had gone to Prāg-
jyotiṣapura 2. 42. 7; (7) Prophecies regard-
ing Dvārakā: (i) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada
that at the conjunction of Dvāpara and
Kali (द्वापरस्य कलेश् चैव संधौ 12.
326. 82) he would be born at Mathurā
but would make Kuśasthalī (i. e. Dvārakā)
his residence (कुशस्थलीं करिष्यामि
निवासं द्वारकां पुरीम्) 12. 326. 83-85;
while residing in that city he would kill
Naraka, Mura and Pīṭha 12. 326. 84; he
would also kill the demons and take the
wealth of Prāgjyotiṣapura to Kuśasthalī
(प्राग्ज्योतिषपुरं रम्यं नानाधन-
समन्वितम्।कुशस्थलीं नयिष्यामि) 12.
326. 85; having lessened the burden of the
earth he would bring about the destruction
of the Sātvata heroes, his kinsmen and of
Dvārakā (कृत्वा भारावतरणं वसु-
धाया यथेप्सितम्।सर्वसात्वतमुख्या-
नां द्वारकायाश् च सत्तम।करिष्ये प्र-
लयं घोरम् आत्मज्ञातिविनाशनम्॥) 12.
326. 92; (ii) prophesied also by Arjuna
that Dvārakā, which was made his home
by Kṛṣṇa, would be drowned in the sea by
him (द्वारकाम् आत्मसात् कृत्वा समुद्रं
गमयिष्यसि) 3. 13. 31; (iii) Kṛṣṇa too
had foretold that when Arjuna would leave
Dvārakā taking with him the citizens, the
city, together with its ramparts and watch-
towers, would be instantly inundated by the
sea (इमां च नगरीं सद्यः प्रतियाते ध-
नंजये।प्राकाराट्टालकोपेतां समुद्रः
प्लावयिष्यति) 16. 7. 17; 16. 8. 10; (8) Des-
truction of Dvārakā: Arjuna advised all
people to leave the town at the end of a
week and stay outside 16. 8. 12; before
leaving Dvārakā, the citizens (द्वारकावासि-
नः) attended the funeral of Vasudeva 16.
8. 19-23; when all people had left, the city
was overrun by the sea (सागरः … ।द्वार-
कां रत्नसंपूऋणां जलेनाप्लावयत् तदा॥)
16. 8. 40; the people of Dvārakā witnessed
the event the like of which had not happened
before (अद्भुतम्) 16. 8. 41; the people of
Dvārakā who followed Arjuna to Indra-
prastha were handed over to Vajra 16. 8.
73: the Pāṇḍavas when they started on
their great final journey (महाप्रस्थान)
went, on their way, to the west and saw
Dvārakā inundated by the sea (ददृशुर्
द्वारकां चापि सागरेण परिप्लुताम्) 17. 1.
43; Arjuna's going to Dvāravatī, bereft of
the Vṛṣṇi heroes, and his taking with him
the people of Dvāravatī listed in the con-
tents of the Mausalaparvan 1. 2. 223, 226;
(9) After the Pāṇḍavas were established at
Indraprastha Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma left for
Dvāravatī with the consent of the Pāṇḍavas
1. 199. 50. (10) During the period of his
exile Arjuna went from Raivataka mountain
to Dvārakā; the city, even up to the modest
houses (?), was decorated to welcome
him (अलंकृता द्वारका … अपि निष्कुटकेष्व्
अपि) 1. 210. 15-16 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2.
218. 16: निष्कुटेषु गृहारामेष्व् अपि अलंकृता
किम् उत राजमार्गादिषु); the people of
Dvārakā rushed to the main roads to see
Arjuna; women in large numbers rushed
to the windows (?) (अवलोकेषु नारीणाम्
सहस्राणि शतानि च); there was a great
gathering (समवायो महान् अभूत्) of the
Bhojas, the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas;
Arjuna lived (in Dvārakā) in the house
of Kṛṣṇa for many nights 1. 210. 17-21;
once, while Subhadrā was returning to Dvā-
rakā after worshipping Raivataka mountain
she was kidnapped by Arjuna; the helpless
soldiers cried aloud and ran towards Dvā-
rakā 1. 212. 7, 9; the incident is referred to
in 8. 26. 63; (11) The Yādavas, returned to
Dvāravatī after visiting Indraprastha where
they had gone to give gifts to the Pāṇḍa-
vas in connection with the marriage of
Subhadrā 1. 213. 55; Subhadrā's abduction
by Arjuna from Dvārakā referred to (i) in
the Anukramaṇīparvan 1. 1. 103; also listed
in the contents of the Ādiparvan narrated
in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan 1. 2. 92, (ii)
in Vaiśaṃpāyana's summary of the Mahā-
bhārata events 1. 55. 32-34, and (iii) in the
Saṃbhavaparvan of the Ādiparvan 1. 90.
85; (12) After asking Maya to build a
सभा for the Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa left for
Dvārakā 2. 2. 23; (13) Yudhiṣṭhira sent
a messenger to Dvārakā to invite Kṛṣṇa,
living in Dvārakā, for consultations regard-
ing the Rājasūya 2. 12. 29; at the end of the
Rājasūya, Yudhiṣṭhira consented to Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvāravatī; accordingly Kṛṣṇa
reached Dvāravatī 2. 42. 49, 55, 60; (14)
The sons of Draupadī, during the period of
exile of the Pāṇḍavas, went to Vṛṣṇipura
situated in the Ānarta country 3. 180. 25;
later, Satyabhāmā informed Draupadī that
her sons were all well and happy at Dvāra-
vatī 3. 224. 11; (15) Before going to the
Virāṭanagara for the अज्ञातवास, Yudhi-
ṣṭhira sent away Indrasena and others, with
their chariots, to Dvāravatī 4. 4. 3; the
spies, who were sent by Duryodhana in
search of the Pāṇḍavas, told him that the
charioteers of the Pāṇḍavas had reached
Dvāravatī but neither the Pāṇḍavas nor
Kṛṣṇā was to be found in Dvāravatī 4. 24.
15-16; (11) After the marriage of Abhi-
manyu, Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and others, per-
mitted by Virāṭa, went to Dvārakā; after
Kṛṣṇa's departure to Dvārakā, Yudhiṣṭhira
started making all kinds of preparations
for the war (चक्रुः साङ्ग्रामिकं सर्वम्)
5. 5. 11-12; 5. 7. 1 (Dvāravatī); (12)
When Duryodhana knew through his messe-
ngers and spies that Kṛṣṇa had returned
to Dvārakā, he started to go there to seek
Kṛṣṇa's help in war; that very day Arjuna
too arrived in Ānartanagarī; both of them,
after reaching Dvārakā, saw Kṛṣṇa sleep-
ing 5. 7. 3 (आनर्तनगरीं रम्यां जगा-
माशु धनंजयः) 5. 7. 4, 5; (13) When
Balarāma started for his pilgrimage he, on
his way, asked his servants to bring from
Dvārakā all the materials and utensils
required for the pilgrimage, as also the
sacred fires and priests (संभारांस् तीर्थ-
यात्रायां सर्वोपकरणानि च।आनयध्वं
द्वारकाया अग्नीन् वै याजकांस् तथा) 9. 34.
15; when Balarāma chose to go to the
battlefield to watch the duel between
Bhīma and Duryodhana, he sent away his
co-pilgrims and attendants to Dvārakā 9.
53. 32; at the end of the duel, Balarāma,
expressing his disapproval of the way
Bhīma brought about the downfall of
Duryodhana, left for Dvārakā 9. 59. 26;
when he left for Dvāravatī, the Pāñcālas
and the Pāṇḍavas, did not feel very happy
9. 59. 27; (14) When the sacrificial horse
for the Aśvamedha of Yudhiṣṭhira reached
Dvāravatī, king Ugrasena came out of the
town to honour Arjuna who accompanied
the horse 14. 84. 13-15; when Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Kṛṣṇa to give some news about
Arjuna (who was accompanying the horse),
Kṛṣṇa told him that a confidential attendant
who lived in Dvārakā (द्वारकावासी ममा-
प्तः पुरुषः) had seen him (Arjuna) who,
fighting many battles, was emaciated (बहु-
संग्रामकर्शितम्) 14. 88. 9; (15) After the
war, Kṛṣṇa informed Arjuna his intention
to return to Dvāravatī to meet his father,
Baladeva and others, if permitted by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, but not otherwise; hence he wanted
Yudhiṣṭhira to be informed by Arjuna
about his wish to go to Dvārakā 14. 15.
20-21, 26, 31; before Kṛṣṇa's return to
Dvārakā, Arjuna wanted Kṛṣṇa to tell him
once again what he taught him before in the
Gītā 14. 16. 6-7; Arjuna approved Kṛṣṇa's
wish to return to Dvārakā; so he suggest-
ed that they should go to Hāstinapura to
seek Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvārakā 14. 50. 51; 14. 51. 23;
Arjuna sought Yudhiṣṭhira's permission
for Kṛṣṇa's return to Ānartanagarī 14. 51.
40-41; Yudhiṣṭhira gave Kṛṣṇa his permi-
ssion to return to Dvāravatī to see his
father 14. 51. 42; Arjuna and others emb-
raced Kṛṣṇa when he left Hāstinapura to
go to Dvārakā 14. 52. 1; (16) Yudhiṣṭhira
was grieved to think of what Subhadrā, who
was then in Dvārakā (द्वारकावासिनी), would
say to Kṛṣṇa when he returned to Dvārakā
(since her son was killed in war) 12. 1. 16;
(17) Aśvatthāman once went to Dvārakā
where he stayed for some time honoured
by the Vṛṣṇis; he wanted to exchange his
Brahmaśiras missile for the Sudarśana of
Kṛṣṇa; while he was in Dvāravatī (वसन्
द्वारवतीम् अनु), one day he approached
Kṛṣṇa who was sitting alone on seashore;
Kṛṣṇa informed Aśvatthāman that none of
the Vṛṣṇi and the Andhaka heroes who lived
in Dvārakā had ever asked him to part with
his Sudarśana 10. 12. 11-12, 15, 31-33;
(18) The Yādavas, headed by Sāraṇa,
once saw Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva, Nārada and
other sages who were on a visit to Dvārakā
16. 2. 4; by the proclamation of a royal
decree Āhuka prohibited fermentation of
spirituous liquor in all the houses of Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas living in the town (Dvārakā)
(अद्यप्रभृति सर्वेषु वृष्ण्यन्धकगृहेष्व्-
इह।सुरासवो न कर्तव्यः सर्वैर् नगर-
वासिभिः) 16. 2. 17-18; one of the bad
omens that occurred for the citizens of
Dvārakā was that a laughing black woman
with white teeth entered the houses at
night, stole the marriage threads of women
while they were asleep, and ran through
the streets of Dvārakā (काली स्त्री पाण्डुरैर्
दन्तैः प्रविश्य हसती निशि।स्त्रियः स्व-
प्नेषु मुष्णन्ती द्वारकां परिधावति)
16. 4. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 3. 1: मुष्णन्ती
स्त्रीणाम् मङ्गलसूत्रादिकं चोरयन्ती);
when the Yādavas were destroyed, Kṛṣṇa
entered Dvāravatī and told Vasudeva to
guard the women folk and wait for the
arrival of Arjuna in Dvāravatī 16. 5. 7;
16. 7. 13; when Arjuna reached Dvārakā
with Dāruka the city appeared to him like
a woman who had lost her husband (मृत-
नाथाम् इव स्त्रियम्) 16. 6. 4; Arjuna, after
he witnessed the plight of Dvārakā and
the women of Kṛṣṇa he wept loudly and
fell down on the ground 16. 6. 12.
E. Past
events or events not related to the epic
narrative: (1) Kṛṣṇa told Uttaṅka whom
he met on his way to Dvārakā that he
(Uttaṅka) should think of him (Kṛṣṇa)
if he desired something 14. 54. 13; Govinda
(Kṛṣṇa) gave boon to Uttaṅka and went
to Dvārakā in the company of Sātyaki
14. 58. 2, 3 (Dvāravatī); (2) Pious king
Nṛga, due to a sin unknowingly committed
by him (13. 69. 22; 13. 71. 2), had to live
as a lizard in a deep well at Dvāravatī 13.
69. 1-4; Kṛṣṇa liberated him when the
Yādavas were settling down at Dvāravatī
13. 71. 2-3; 13. 69. 25-29; (3) Śiva, in
the form of Durvāsas, lived for a long time
with Kṛṣṇa in his residence at Dvāravatī
13. 145. 35; (4) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Bhīṣ-
ma the kind of gifts which one should
give under different नक्षत्रस् (नक्षत्र-
योगस्येदानीं दानकल्पं ब्रवीहि मे);
Bhīṣma then told him what formerly Nārada,
who had arrived at Dvārakā, told Devaki
in reply to her question 13. 63. 1-4.
F.
Dvārakā as a holy place: Described as
holy (पुण्या) 3. 86. 21; Yudhiṣṭhira, while
on a pilgrimage, visited Dvārakā (यच् चापि
तीर्थानि चरन्न् अगच्छं द्वारकां प्रति)
7. 85. 63; a holy place Piṇḍāraka located
in Dvāravatī 3. 80. 82.
G. Similes:
(1) The city Dvārakā was well protected
and well camouflaged and was furnished
with all kinds of weapons as is done for
the residence of Indra (सुरक्षितं सुगुप्-
तं च सर्वायुधसमन्वितम्।तत् पुरं
भरतश्रेष्ठ यथेन्द्रभवनं तथा॥)
3. 16. 18; (2) As Indra left for heaven
after killing his enemies so did Kṛṣṇa leave
for Ānartapurī (when all the Kauravas
were killed) 14. 51. 56; (3) Dvārakā,
bereft of Vṛṣṇi heroes, compared with a
woman who had lost her husband (द्वार-
कां … मृतनाथां इव स्त्रियम्) 16. 6. 4;
(4) In a long drawn metaphor Dvārakā
compared to a river: the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas were its water, horses its fishes,
chariots its boats, the sound of musical
instruments and the one produced by
chariots its current, residences and holy
bathing places its big crocodiles, jewels
its thick layer of moss, ramparts made of
वज्र its garlands, streets its whirlpools,
cross-roads its steady, deep pieces of water,
Rāma and Kṛṣṇa its big sharks; this
river in the form of Dvārakā looked like
the terrible Vaitaraṇī river having the noose
of Kāla as its shark (ताम् स वृष्ण्यन्-
धकजलां हयमीनां रथोडुपाम्।
वादित्ररथघोषौघां वेश्मतीर्थमहा-
ग्रहाम्॥रत्नशैवलसंघाटां वज्रप्रा-

द्वारकासरितम् तदा।कालपाशग्रहां घो-
रां नदीं वैतरणीम् इव॥) 16. 6. 8-10;
(5) Arjuna saw Dvārakā bereft of Vṛṣṇi
heroes like a lotus pond in winter which
is without its glory and gives no delight
(गतश्रियं निरानन्दां पद्मिनीं शिशिरे
यथा) 16. 6. 11.

द्वारपाल
Dvārapāla nt.: Name of a city (पुर) ?
Nakula subjugated the city in his
expedition to the west (प्रतीचीम् अभितो
दिशम् 2. 29. 2) before the Rājasūya (तथा
वृन्दाटकं पुरम्।द्वारपालं च तरसा
वशे चक्रे महाद्युतिः) 2. 29. 10.

धृतराष्ट्रस्य
Dhṛtarāṣṭrasya āśramaḥ1 m.: An
आश्रम established by Dhṛtarāṣṭra at Kuru-
kṣetra; also called Kurukṣetrāśrama (15.
29. 21).
A. Location: At Kurukṣetra, on the
other bank of Yamunā at some distance
from the river; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra, with
Gāndhārī and Kuntī, left Hāstinapura he
reached Kurukṣetra (कुरुक्षेत्रं जगाम
सः) 15. 25. 8; when Yudhiṣṭhira, with his
brothers and wife, went to meet Dhṛtarāṣṭra
in his आश्रम he had to cross the river
Yamunā (ततो युधिष्ठिरो राजा कुरुक्षे-
त्रम् अवातरत्। … उत्तीर्य यमुनां … स
ददर्शाश्रमं दूरात् … धृतराष्ट्रस्य)
15. 30. 16-17; 15. 31. 6; it was situated near
the आश्रम of Śatayūpa 15. 25. 9, 12; 15. 30.
17; also not far from Bhāgīrathī 15. 25. 8;
15. 39. 18, 21; 15. 40. 4.
B. Description:
Solitary (शून्य) 15. 31. 3; resorted to by
Siddhas and Cāraṇas (सिद्धचारणसेवीत)
15. 31. 20; in the precincts of the आश्रम
there were fire altars with burning sacrifi-
cial fires attended to by sages who had
taken bath and who gave offerings in the fire
(ददर्श तत्र वेदीश् च संप्रज्वलितपाव-
काः।कृताभिषेकैर् मुनिभिर् आहुताग्निभिर्
उपस्थिताः।) 15. 34. 7; the fire altars were
scattered with forest flowers, were full of
smoke issuing from clarified butter, were
endowed with Brahmanical lustre, and were
surrounded by hosts of sages (वानेय-
पुष्पनिकरैर् आज्यधूमोद्गमैर् अपि।ब्रा-
ह्मेण वपुषा युक्ता युक्ता मुनिगणैश् च
ताः) 15. 34. 8; the hermitage was full of deer
(मृगगणाकीर्ण) 15. 31. 3; herds of deer
moved about undistractedly near the आश्रम
and singing birds flew over it fearlessly;
notes of peacocks, Dātyūhas, sweet sounds
of cuckoos and sounds of Vedic recitations
of Brāhmaṇas could be heard at different
places (मृगयूथैर् अनुद्विग्नैस् तत्र तत्र
समाश्रितैः।अशङ्कितैः पक्षिगणैः प्रगी-
तैर् इव च प्रभो॥केकाभिर् नीलकण्ठा-
नां दात्यूहानां च कूजितैः।कोकिलानां
च कुहरैः शुभैः श्रुतिमनोहरैः॥)
15. 34. 9-10; beautified by large number of
banana trees (कदलीवनशोभित) 15. 31. 3;
there were large baskets for collecting fruits
and roots (फलमूलसमुद्वाहैर् महद्-
भिश् चोपशोभितम्) 15. 34. 11.
C. Epic
events: (1) In Kurukṣetra, Dhṛtarāṣṭra
first reached the आश्रम of the royal sage
Śatayūpa; he lived in this आश्रम and after
he was initiated by Vyāsa in his own
आश्रम and was instructed by Śatayūpa in
the way of the life of a forest-dweller,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra established another आश्रम for
himself, Gāndhārī and Kuntī for the pra-
ctice of austerities (ययौ व्यासाश्रमं
तदा। … स दिक्षां तत्र संप्राप्य राजा …

स … ।एकपादस्थितस् तीव्रं चचार सुम-
हत् तपः॥अवाक्शिरास् तथा चापि नेत्रैर्
अनिमिषैर् दृढम्) 3. 185. 4-5; (4) Ser-
pent Śeṣa was disgusted with the behavi-
our of his brother-serpents; hence, among
other holy places, he repaired to Badarī
to practise austerities 1. 32. 3; (5) In
the Kṛta age a Rākṣasa named Cārvāka
practised austerities for many years at
Badarī 12. 39. 39; (6) In the Kṛta age

ing regulations and vows, full of those who
were initiated, who took limited food, and
who had disciplined themselves, resorted
to by Vālakhilyas and many mendicants
(व्रतिभिर् बहुभिः कीऋणं तापसैर् उपशो-
भितम्॥ब्राह्मणैश् च … नियमव्रतसं-
पन्नैः समाकीर्णं तपस्विभिः।दीक्षितैर्
 … यताहारैः कृतात्मभिः॥ … वालखिल्यैश्

arrived at Brahmāśrama and was honour-
ed by the ascetics; he desired to practise
धर्म (इच्छामि धर्मं चर्तुम्) 13. 10.
13, and hence requested the head of the
आश्रम (कुलपति) to teach him and initiate
him into the ascetic practices (तन् मां त्वं
भगवन् वक्तुं प्रव्राजयितुम् अर्हसि) 13.
10. 13 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 14: प्रव्राज-
यितुम् विधिवत् स्वोचितं कर्म त्याजयितुम्);
the head of the आश्रम told him that it was
not possible for him to be an ascetic (प्र-
व्राजक) and live in the आश्रम (न शक्यम्
इह शूद्रेण लिङ्गम् आश्रित्य वर्तितुम्) 13.
10. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 16: लिङ्गं
संन्यासचिह्नम्); so the Śūdra went some
distance from the आश्रमपद and constru-
cted a cottage for himself; he put up an
altar, levelled the ground, and raised abodes
for gods (गत्वाश्रमपदाद् दूरम् उटजं
कृतवांस् तु सः।तत्र वेदिं च भूमिं
च देवतायतनानि च।निवेश्य।) 13. 10. 17
(Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 13. 10. 20:
वेदीं पूजार्थं, भूमिं शयनाद्यर्थम्);
a certain ascetic (मुनि, ऋषि, तापस) who
acted as a priest for the rites of manes
(पितृकार्य) of this Śūdra became in his
next birth the Purohita of the king (viz.
the Śūdra who was born as a king); when
the Purohita was told by the king about his
past life he went to the same Brahmāśrama
to practise austerities; he obtained great
perfection (सिद्धिं परां प्राप्तः) and
was respected by the residents of the
आश्रम 13. 10. 10-59.

17; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 136. 17; अग्नि-
होत्रे अग्निहोत्रशालायां; अग्न्यागार 3. 138.
7) where Bharadvāja gave offerings in
fire (अग्निहोत्र) 3. 137. 17; the अग्न्या-
गार was guarded by a blind शूद्र
(शूद्रेणान्धेन रक्षिणा 3. 137. 18; 3.
138. 3.
B. Past events: (1) When
Bharadvāja, after doing the daily Vedic
recitation returned to his आश्रम, the fires,
as usual, did not stand up to greet him
(भरद्वाजस् तु कौन्तेय कृत्वा स्वाध्या-
यम् आह्निकम् … प्रविवेश स्वम् आश्रमम्।
 … पावकाः।न त्वेनम् उपतिष्ठन्ति) 3.
138. 1-2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 137. 1:
आह्निकं स्वाध्यायं प्रत्यहं कर्तव्यं
ब्रह्मयज्ञम्); on enquiry, Bharadvāja was
told by the blind Śūdra that as his son was
trying to enter the अग्न्यागार he was stopped
by him (the Śūdra) and the son was killed
by a Rākṣasa 3. 137. 17-19; 3. 138. 7-8);
(2) The Kāleya demons used to hide
themselves in the ocean during the day; at
night they used to come out and eat the
sages living in holy places and आश्रमस्;
once they killed twenty sages from the
आश्रम of Bharadvāja who were self-contro-
lled, observed celibacy, and lived on air
and water (भरद्वाजाश्रमे चैव नियता
ब्रह्मचारिणः।वाय्वाहाराम्बुभक्षाश् च
विंशतिः संनिपातिताः) 3. 100. 1-2, 5; (3)
When the Hehayas defeated king Divodāsa,
he fled from his town and took shelter with
Bharadvāja in his आश्रम (स त्व् आश्रमम्
उपागम्य भरद्वाजस्य धीमतः।जगाम
शरणं राजा) 13. 31. 23.

भरुकच्छ
Bharukaccha m.: Name of a town.
Sahadeva in his expedition to the south
before the Rājasūya (प्रययौ दक्षिणां
दिशम् 2. 28. 1) reached it and from there
he sent envoys to Paulastya Vibhīṣaṇa
2. 28. 50; the Śūdras from Bharukaccha
(शूद्राः … भरुकच्छनिवासिनः) brought
as tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira for his Rājasūya
a hundred thousand Dāsīs, skins of Raṅku
deer and horses from Gandhāra country
(राङ्कवान्य् अजिनानि च। … हयान् गान्धार-
देशजान्) 2. 47. 7-8.

भूतिलय
Bhūtilaya m.: Name of a village.
Situated in the Bāhlīka (Āraṭṭa)
country 8. 30. 40; a certain Brāhmaṇa sitting
in the Sabhā of the Kauravas had said that
one who bathed at Bhūtilaya could not
hope to go to heaven (भूतिलये स्नात्वा
कथं स्वर्गं गमिष्यति) 8. 30. 42 (accor-
ding to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 8. 44. 41 there was
a pond which was used commonly by both
Caṇḍālas and Brāhmaṇas (hence it was
unholy): भूतिलये हि चन्डालब्राह्मण
साधारण एको जलाशयस् तत्र च स्नातः
कथं स्वर्गं गच्छेन् न कथंचिद् इत्य्
अर्थः); Bhūtilaya is also mentioned in
an अनुवंश stanza which reports what a
Piśācī told a Brāhmaṇī who, with her
son(s), had come to stay on the river
Raupyā; she told the Brāhmaṇī that after
bathing at Bhūtilaya she could not stay near
Raupyā for more than one night; and if
she did stay, some calamity would over-
take her at night (तद्वत् भूतिलये स्ना-
त्वा सपुत्रा वस्तुम् इच्छसि॥एकरात्रम्
उषित्वेह द्वितीयं यदि वत्स्यसि।एतद् वै
ते दिवा वृत्तं रात्रौ वृत्तं अतो ऽन्यथा)
3. 129. 9-10; (according to Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 3. 129. 9 in the opinion of the eastern
critics (प्राञ्चः) Bhūlilaya was a village
of the Dasyus where burnt corpses were
thrown in the river (hence it was unholy),
cf. भूतिलये दस्युग्रामे अग्निदग्धानां
मृतानां क्षेपणं यस्यां नद्यां क्रियते
तस्यां स्नातासि; according to a Dharmaśāstra
stanza cited by Nī. a Brāhmaṇa who had
lived in Bhūtilaya was to observe Prājāpatya
vrata as an expiation: एतत्करणे प्रायश्-
चित्तं धर्मशास्त्रे प्रसिद्धम्। … प्रोष्य
भूलिलये विप्रः प्राजापत्यं व्रतं चरेत्;
in the opinion of the critics nearer to Nī.
(अर्वाञ्चः) भूलिलय meant pure ब्रह्मन्
(भूतिर् ऐश्वर्यम्।तस्यापि च लयो ऽस्मिन्न्
इति शुद्धं ब्रह्म) and स्नात्वा meant
मलं त्यक्त्वा).

भृगोर्
Bhṛgor āśramaḥ1 m.: The आश्रम
established by Bhṛgu.
Past events: (1) King Yuvanāśva,
who lived in forest, entered the आश्रम of
Bhṛgu and drank from a jar filled with
water that was sanctified with the मन्त्रस्
and consecrated with austerities (संभृतो
मन्त्रपूतेन वारिणा कलशो महान् 3. 126.
10; आपस् तपसा चैव संभृताः 3. 126. 18);
(the waters were meant for the queen and
were to cause birth of a son) 3. 126. 8,
12, 14; (2) When Bhṛgu had gone to
bathe, a certain Rakṣas approached his
आश्रम; entering it, he saw there Pulomā,
the wife of Bhṛgu; the Rakṣas was re-
ceived by Pulomā (in the आश्रम) with
fruits and roots 1. 5. 13-15; the Rakṣas
wanted to abduct Pulomā from the आश्रम
after ascertaining from Agni that Pulomā
was really the wife of Bhṛgu 1. 5. 20, 25;
(3) When Vītahavya's sons were killed
by Pratardana, he (Vītahavya) abandoned
his city and fled to the आश्रम of Bhṛgu
(प्राद्रवन् नगरं हित्वा भृगोर् आश्रमम्
अप्य् उत) 13. 31. 41; Pratardana followed
Vītahavya to Bhṛgu's आश्रम; he told Bhṛgu
that he wanted to see his pupils living in the
आश्रम; knowing this, Bhṛgu came out of
the आश्रम, honoured Pratardana, and was
told that there was no Kṣatriya living in
the आश्रम; all the inmates of the आश्रम
were twice-born; as a result, Vītahavya
became a Brāhmaṇa; Pratardana was happy
that he was instrumental in bringing about
the change in the जाति of Vītahavya (change
from क्षत्रिय to द्विज) 13. 31. 43-51. [See
Cyavanasya āśramaḥ above p. 528 and
Bhṛgutuṅga Vol. 1. 5, p. 400]

भृगोर्

advertently killed the cow of a Brāhmaṇa
(स कदाचित् समुद्रान्ते विचरन्न् आश्रमा-
न्तिके) 12. 2. 19; Karṇa, after he received
the ब्रह्मास्त्र, lived happily in the आश्रम

Raupyā for more than one night; otherwise

शफं क्षीरं सुरातुल्यम्’ इति।‘संसृज्य
संकरैः सार्धं प्राजापत्यं व्रतं
चरेत्’ इति; according to अर्वाञ्चः, however,
eating curds etc. entitled the person to stay
near Raupyā for one night, but not a
second; according to these interpreters of
the stanza युगन्धर meant जीव and
दधिप्राशन meant leading a married life
for paying back the threefold debt: युगन्-
धरः स्थूलशरीराभिमानि जीवः। … दधि-
प्राशनशब्देन धर्मप्रजासंपत्त्यर्थो
दारसंयोग उच्यते। … दधिप्राशन-

down the Rākṣasas standing at the fort-
ress (of Laṅkā) (दुर्गस्थान् पातयाम् आस
राक्षसान्) 3. 268. 38-39; there was much
fighting in Laṅkā in which the targets
were struck and victory was in view;
then Rāma asked his armies to stop
fighting (कृते विमर्दे लङ्कायाम् ल-
ब्धलक्षो जयोत्तरः॥) 3. 268. 40 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 3. 284. 41: लब्धाः आयुधैः

वर्धमानद्वार
Vardhamānadvāra, Vardhamānapuradvāra
 nt.: Name of the gate of Hāstina-
pura facing the town Vardhamāna.
Epic events: (1) Kuntī, after the
death of Pāṇḍu, came in the company of the
ascetics and her sons to Kurujāṅgala and
from there she reached the Vardhamāna-
puradvāra before entering Hāstinapura
(सा … संप्राप्ता कुरुजाङ्गलम्।वर्ध-
मानपुरद्वारं आससाद यशस्विनी॥) 1.
117. 8 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 1. 10: वर्ध-
मानपुरं नाम ग्रामविशेषः।तदभि-
मुखं द्वारम्; however, on 1. 126. 9
he simply says: वर्धमानपुरद्वारं
मुख्यद्वारम्); (2) The Pāṇḍavas when
they left Hāstinapura for their exile, came
out of the Vardhamānapura gate and
went to the north (निर्ययुर् गजसाह्वयात्।
वर्धमानपुरद्वारेणाभिनिष्क्रम्य ते त-
दा।उदङ्मुखाः … प्रययुः॥) 3. 1. 8-9;
(3) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to repair
to the forest he left Hāstinapura coming
out of the Vardhamānadvāra (स वर्ध-
मानद्वारेण निर्ययौ गजसाह्वयात्) 15. 22.
3; (Vardhamānadvāra, according to S. K.
Belvalkar, means ‘an entrance or exit other
than the southern’, cf. दक्षिणाद्वारहीनं
तु वर्धमानम् उदाहृतम् from the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā of Varāhamihira 53. 33. 36 cited by
him. Dr. Belvalkar further observes: “It is
also the name of a specific gate of Hastinā-
pura”, his note on the stanza in the Cr. Ed.
Vol. 19, p. 153. The Bṛhatsaṃhitā passage,
however, seems to mean that a house which
does not have a gate to the south is called
Vardhamāna. The editions of the Bṛhat-
saṃhitā consulted by me read in 53. 33 as
तद्वच् च (or तस्मिंश् च) वर्धमाने
द्वारं तु न दक्षिणं कार्यम्).

blished in the kingdom (विवासयितुम् अर्हति
मृदुनैवाभ्युपायेन नगरं वारणाव-
तम्) 1. 130. 10-11; there would be no

keys 1. 132. 6-7; Purocana was to build
at Vāraṇāvata for the Pāṇḍavas a house
of four halls, well concealed, and in the

town (अष्टमे ऽहनि रोहिण्यां प्रयाताः
फल्गुनस्य ते।वारणावतम् आसाद्य ददृशुर्
नागरं जनम्॥) 1. 133. 30; the people of
Vāraṇāvata, delighted, came out to receive
the Pāṇḍavas with all auspicious things;

he had gone to Saubha, the town of Śālva,
to kill him (शाल्वस्य नगरं सौभं गतो
ऽहम्) 3. 15. 2; in the absence of Kṛṣṇa,
Śālva, enraged at the killing of Śiśupāla, rode
his Saubha, moving at will, and attacked
Dvārakā (आगतः कामगं सौभम् आरु-
ह्य) 3. 15. 5-7; when Śālva did not find
Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā, he reviled Kṛṣṇa, rode
his Saubha, and flew up in the sky (दिवम्
आस्थितः।कामगेन च सौभेन क्षिप्त्वा
माम्) 3. 15. 15; therefore Kṛṣṇa, when he
returned to Dvārakā from Indraprastha, left
for the destruction of Saubha (ततः सौ-
भवधायाहं प्रतस्थे) 3. 15. 19; Yudhi-
ṣṭhira then requested Kṛṣṇa to tell him the
downfall of Saubha in detail (विस्तरेण …
सौभस्य वधम् आचक्ष्व) 3. 16. 1; when
Śālva reached Dvārakā, he besieged it on
all sides, arranging his sky-moving town (all
around) in battle positions (अरुन्धत् तां
(द्वारवतीं पुरीम्) … सर्वतः … ।शाल्वो
वैहायसं चापि तत्पुरं व्यूह्य विष्ठि-
तः॥) 3. 16. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3. 15. 3:
व्यूह्य स्वरक्षापरोपमर्दयोग्यरचना-
विशेषेण स्थापयित्वा); Dvārakā was well
protected when Śālva attacked it (तदा
सौभसमागमे) 3. 16. 19; when Śālva's
heroes were killed in battle, he (went
back; but) came again in his Saubha,
moving at will, to attack Dvārakā (काम-
गेन स सौभेन शाल्वः पुनर् उपागमत्)
3. 17. 27; the army in Dvārakā was dis-
tressed seeing Śālva descending from sky
on the earth (दृष्ट्वा शाल्वं … सौभस्थं
पृथिवीगतम्) 3. 17. 28; Pradyumna assu-
red his army that he would defeat in battle
the Saubha with its king (Śālva) (न भीः
कार्या।सौभराड् अद्य नश्यति। … ससौ-
भो विनशिष्यति) 3. 17. 30-32; Pradyumna
confounded all demons of the Saubha
with quickly shifting the bow from palm
to palm (स … चापं विहरन् वै तलात्
तलम्।मोहयाम् आस दैतेयान् सर्वान् सौ-
भनिवासिनः) 3. 18. 4; when defeated by
Pradyumna, Śālva abandoned Dvārakā,
rode his Saubha and flew up in the sky
(सौभम् आस्थाय … दिवम् आचक्रमे) 3.
20. 27; when Kṛṣṇa, on his return to Dvā-
rakā, learnt about the attack on Dvārakā
by Śālva, he vowed to destroy the town
Saubha along with Śālva (सशाल्वं सौभ-
नगरं हन्ता) 3. 21. 9; when he learnt that
Sālva, in his Saubha, had gone back, he
pursued him (प्रयातं सौभम् आस्थाय)
3. 21. 15; Kṛṣṇa left for the destruction of
Saubha after asking Sātyaki and others to
protect Dvārakā (तेषु रक्षां समाधाय
प्रयातः सौभपातने) 3. 22. 17; Śālva
then in his Saubha, had taken refuge in
the bay of the ocean and remained hidden
in its navel (ततः सागरम् आसाद्य कुक्षौ
तस्य महोर्मिणः।समुद्रनाभ्यां शाल्वो
ऽभूत् सौभम् आस्थाय) 3. 21. 16 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 20. 17: नाभ्यां गर्भे गुप्त
इत्य् अर्थः); Kṛṣṇa's arrows could not reach
the town (Saubha) (पुरं नासाद्यत
शरैः) 3. 21. 18; the Saubha though close
to the sky appeared as if it was at a dis-
tance of only a क्रोश from Kṛṣṇa (खे
विषक्तं हि तत् सौभं क्रोशमात्र इवा-
भवत्) 3. 21. 25; when Kṛṣṇa's arrows
pierced the bodies of the Dānavas, there
was a loud din in the Saubha (ततो हल-
हलाशब्दः सौभमध्ये व्यवर्धत) 3.
21. 28; Kṛṣṇa saw Vasudeva falling down
from Saubha: but after some time, Saubha,
Śālva and Vasudeva disappeared; all this
was माया of Śālva (अपश्यं … प्रपतन्-
तम् अहं तदा।सौभाच् छूरसुतं) 3.
22. 22; न तत्र सौभं न रिपुं न
शाल्वम् पश्यामि वृद्धं पितरं न चापि॥
ततो ममासीन् मनसि मायेयम्) 3. 22. 29-
30; Kṛṣṇa then felled down the heads of
the demons from the Saubha (सौभाच्
छिरांसि विबुधद्विषाम्) 3. 23. 1; the
Saubha then disappeared due to माया of
Śālva (ततो नादृश्यत तदा सौभं … ।
अन्तर्हितं माययाभूत्) 3. 23. 3; Saubha,
moving at will, went to Prāgjyotiṣa and, (on
its return), was seen again (ततः प्राग्ज्योति-
षं गत्वा पुनर् एव व्यदृश्यत।सौभं
कामगमम्) 3. 23. 9 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 3.
22. 9: प्राग्ज्योतिषं पूर्वसमुद्रतीरस्थं
नगरविशेषं); Kṛṣṇa's charioteer drew his
attention to Śālva, the ruler of Saubha (पश्य
 … शाल्वं सौभपतिं स्थितम्) 3. 23. 20;
Kṛṣṇa then decided to kill Śālva and bring
down Saubha (युद्धे मतिम् अधारयम्।
वधाय शाल्वराजस्य सौभस्य च निपात-
ने॥) 3. 23. 27; he then employed the आग्नेय
अस्त्र on his चक्र and commanded “kill
Saubha and my enemies” (आग्नेयम् अस्त्रम्
 … चक्रम् … अभिमन्त्र्य … जहि सौभं
स्ववीर्येण ये चात्र रिपवो मम।इत्य्
उक्त्वा … तस्मै प्राहिणवम्) 3. 23. 28. 31;
the चक्र struck the town Saubha and cut
it into two in the middle; when the Saubha
fell down the चक्र came back to Kṛṣṇa's
hand (तत् समासाद्य नगरं सौभम् …
मध्येन पाटयाम् आस … ।द्विधा कृतं
ततः सौभम् … तस्मिन् निपतिते सौभे
चक्रम् आगात् करं मम) 3. 23. 33-35; see-
ing the Saubha on fire, the women (of the
Dānavas) fled 3. 23. 39; Kṛṣṇa steadied his
chariot near the Saubha and blew his conch
(ततो ऽहं समवस्थाप्य रथं सौभ-
समीपतः शङ्खं प्रध्माप्य) 3. 23. 38;
after killing Śālva and bringing down the
Saubha, Kṛṣṇa returned to the Ānarta
country (एवं निहत्य समरे शाल्वं सौ-
भं निपात्य च।आनर्तान् पुनर् आगम्य)
3. 23. 40; the downfall of Saubha and the
killing of Śālva by Kṛṣṇa is referred to
at various places: (1) By Arjuna when
he recounted the exploits of Kṛṣṇa (त्वया
सौभं च पातितम्) 3. 13. 29; (2) By
Arjuna again in his message to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
through Saṃjaya (अयं सौभं योधयाम्
आस खस्थं … सौभद्वारि प्रत्यगृह्णाच्
छतघ्नीम्) 5. 47. 73 (reference to 3. 22.
2-3 where attack on Kṛṣṇa with शतघ्नीस्
and other missiles is mentioned ?); (3) By
Kṛṣṇa when he suggested to Yudhiṣṭhira
to send Suyodhana and his allies the way
Śālva and Saubha had gone (प्रस्थाप्य-
तां पाण्डव धार्तराष्ट्रः सुयोधनः …
सौभस्य सौभाधिपतेश् च मार्गम्॥)
3. 180. 33; (4) By Vidura when he remind-
ed Duryodhana that a monkey-chief, Dvi-
vida by name, covered Kṛṣṇa with rocks
at the gate of Saubha in order to arrest him
but he did not succeed (सौभद्वारे वानरे-
न्द्रो द्विविदो नाम नामतः।शिलावर्षेण
महता छादयाम् आस केशवम्॥ग्रहीतु-
कमो … ग्रहीतुं नाशकत् तत्र) 5. 128. 41-
42 (reference to 3. 23. 10-19 where the
showering of rocks is attributed to a Dānava
who had assumed the form of a monkey
दानवो वानराकृतिः); (5) By Dhṛtarāṣṭra
when he recounted Kṛṣṇa's wonderful
exploits (दिव्यानि कर्माणि 7. 10. 1); he re-
ferred to his bringing down Saubha which
had taken refuge in the bay of the ocean
(सौभं … समुद्रकुक्षौ विक्रम्य पात-
याम् आस माधवः) 7. 10. 14 (reference
to 3. 21. 16-38); (6) By Bhagavān when
he told Nārada that at the conjunction
of Dvāpara and Kali he would destroy all
those residing in the Saubha (सर्वान् सौ-
भनिवासिनः) 12. 326. 87.
E. Simile: The
falling down of the Saubha, when struck
by Sudarśana, compared with the falling
down of Tripura tossed up by the arrow
of Maheśvara (सौभं सुदऽशनबलाद्
धतम्।महेश्वरशरोद्धूतं पपात
त्रिपुरं यथा) 3. 23. 34.

सौभ
Saubha2 nt.: Name of the city of
king Śālva.
A. Its king: Śālva is referred to as
Saubhapati 1. 96. 48; 5. 175. 24; 5. 176. 2;
as Saubharāj 5. 176. 36; sometimes the
name of the king is identified with the
name of the city and hence the king of
the city Saubha is referred to as Śālvapati
instead of Saubhapati in 5. 171. 6; 5. 172.
2, 10, 14, 18; 5. 174. 3; 5. 175. 22 (मया
शाल्वपतिर् वीर मनसाभिवृतः पतिः
where पति is repeated; cf. with this 1. 96.
48 where सौभपतिः occurs and not शाल्व-
पतिः); 5. 176. 34.
B. Epic event:
When Śālva was defeated by Bhīṣma, he
returned to his town (Saubha) (ततः

chosen the king of Saubha as her husband
(मया सौभपतिः पूर्वं मनसाभिवृतः
पतिः) 1. 96. 48; permitted by Bhīṣma, she
went to the town Saubha (गता सौभ-
पुरं प्रति) 5. 178. 10; Ambā returned to
Śālva, the ruler of Saubha, and told him
that she was allowed by Bhīṣma to go to
him (शाल्वं सौभपतिं ततः।कन्ये-
यं … वचनम् अब्रवीत्॥विसर्जितास्मि
भीष्मेण) 5. 175. 24-25; Ambā approached
the king of Saubha, but he did not accept
her (सौभराजम् उपेत्याहम् अब्रुवं दुर्-
वचं वचः।न च मां प्रत्यगृह्णात् सः)
5. 176. 36; when rejected by Śālva, Ambā
went out of the town (Saubha) and took
resort in the आश्रम of the ascetics outside
the town (निश्चक्राम पुराद् दीना) 5. 172.
23; 5. 173. 1; (जगाम नगराद् बहिः।
आश्रमं … तापसानाम्) 5. 173. 9; Akṛta-
vraṇa, the follower of Rāma, told Ambā
that if she desired Rāma to enjoin the
ruler of Saubha (to accept her), he (Rāma)
would do so (यदि सौभपतिर् भद्रे नियो-
क्तव्यो मते तव।नियोक्ष्यति … तं रामः)

child, a daughter, begotten on her by the
Gandharva king Viśvāvasu, on the bank
of a river near the आश्रम of Sthūlakeśa
(मेनका … तं गर्भं … ।उत्ससर्ज
यथाकालं स्थूलकेशाश्रमं प्रति॥उत्सृ-
ज्य चैव तं गर्भं नद्यास् तीरे जगाम
ह) 1. 8. 6-7; Sthūlakeśa saw the new-born
child alone on the bank of the river; he
brought her to his आश्रम and reared her
(तां ददर्श समुत्सृष्टां नदीतीरे महान्
ऋषिः। … स तां दृष्ट्वा तदा कन्यां स्थूल-
केशो … ।जग्राहाथ मुनिश्रेष्ठः … पुपोष

she was named Pramadvarā; Ruru, son of
Pramati, saw her in the आश्रम and fell in
love with her; when Ruru asked for her

A. Founding and explanation of the
name: The city was founded by king
Hastin, the son of Suhotra and Suvarṇā;
that is why the city is called Hāstinapura
(तस्याम् (i. e. सुवर्णायाम्) अस्य (i. e.
सुहोत्रस्य) जज्ञे हस्ती।य इदं हास्तिन-
पुरं मापयाम् आस।एतद् अस्य हास्तिन-
पुरत्वम्) 1. 90. 36;
B. Description:
Delightful (रम्य) 1. 94. 10; the best
city (नगरोत्तम) 13. 153. 5; praised
as the best among towns (ततो निर्वचनं
लोके सर्वराष्ट्रेष्व् अवर्तत॥ … पुराणां
गजसाह्वयम्॥) 1. 102. 21-22 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 1. 109. 23: निर्वचनं प्रशंसा);
comparable with the city of Indra (पुरन्-
दरपुरोपम) 1. 94. 38; the houses in
Hāstinapura looked like white mountains
(श्वेतपर्वतरूपेभ्यो गृहेभ्यः) 11. 9. 9;
the capital town of the Kurus (कुरूणाम्
पुटभेदने) 1. 94. 10 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
1. 100. 12: पुटभेदने पत्तने).
C. Des-
cription of the town on specific occasions:
(1) On the arrival of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna:
full of delighted people (संप्रहृष्टनरा-
कुल) 14. 51. 24; (2) When the still-born
child, Parīkṣit, was brought back to life:
people decorated the town with heaps of
garlands; citizens beautified their houses
with small and big flags; the highways
were decorated with flowers; the city looked
bright and produced sound similar to the
tide of the ocean; owing to the sound of
dancing and singing of dancers the town
appeared like the residence of Vaiśravaṇa
(Kubera); the city's empty places were
filled with bards in thousands, accom-
panied by women; flags moving in the blow-
ing wind as if pointed out to the Kurus
the northern and the southern direction;
the high-placed king's officer then announc-
ed to the people enjoyment, all through the
night, in which ornaments of jewels were
to be displayed (अलंचक्रुश् च माल्यौ-
घैः पुरुषा नागसाह्वयम्॥पताकाभिर्
विचित्राभिर् ध्वजैश् च विविधैर् अपि।वेश्मानि
समलंचक्रुः पौराश् चापि जनाधिप॥
राजमार्गाश् च तत्रासन् सुमनोभिर् अलं-
कृताः।शुशुभे तत् पुरं चापि समुद्रौ-
घनिभस्वनम्॥नर्तकैश् चापि नृत्यद्-
भिर् गायकानां च निस्वनैः।आसीद्
वैश्रवणस्येव निवासस् तत् पुरं तदा॥
बन्दिभिश् च नरै राजन् स्त्री सहायैः सह-
स्रशः।तत्र तत्र विविक्तेषु समन्ताद्
उपशोभितम्॥पताका धूयमानाश् च श्व-
सता मातरिश्वना।अदर्शयन्न् इव तदा
कुरून् वै दक्षिणोत्तरान्॥अघोषयत् तदा
चापि पुरुषो राजधूर्गतः।सर्वरात्रिविहारो
ऽद्य रत्नाभरणलक्षणः॥) 14. 69. 13-20;
(3) After the departure of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī, Kuntī and Vidura, the whole
town with its old men, women and child-
ren became cheerless, the town was as if
without any sound as at the end of a festival
(तद् अहृष्टम् इवाकूजं गतोत्सवम् इवाभ-
वत्।नगरं हास्तिनपुरं सस्त्रीवृद्ध-
कुमारकं॥) 15. 24. 14.
D. Epic events:
The name of the city occurs in connection
with many important events; on various
occasions, however, Hāstinapura is referred
to simply by words such as नगर or पुर
(in the following listing references of this
type where the city is not directly named
are likely to be incomplete) (1) Jana-
mejaya, son of Parikṣit, after the comple-
tion of his सत्र at Kurukṣetra, returned
to Hāstinapura and searched for a suita-
ble Purohita who could pacify the evil
act done by him (स तस्मिन् सत्रे समाप्ते
हास्तिनपुरं प्रत्येत्य पुरोहितम् अनुरू-
पम् अन्विच्छमानः परं यत्नम् अकरोद्
यो मे पापकृत्यां शमयेद् इति) 1. 3. 10 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 1. 3. 11: पापकृत्यां शापरू-
पां बलायुःप्राणनिकृन्तनीं देवताम्);
(2) Uttaṅka, wanting to take revenge on
Takṣaka for his misdeed, started for Hāsti-
napura; (उत्तङ्कः … हास्तिनपुरं प्रतस्-
थे।स हास्तिनपुरं प्राप्य) 1. 3. 177-
178; (3) Parikṣit, after placing the body
of a dead snake on the shoulder of Śṛṅgin's
father returned to his town Gajāhvaya
(स्वनगरं प्रतियातो गजाह्वयम्) 1. 37.
9; (4) When Kāśyapa ceased from pro-
ceeding to Hāstinapura, Takṣaka himself
went speedily to the town Nāgasāhvaya
(निवृत्ते काश्यपे … ।जगाम तक्षकस् तूर्-
णं नगरं नागसाह्वयम्॥) 1. 39. 20;
(5) Śaṃtanu ruled the earth from Hāsti-
napura, the capital town of the Kurus (स
हास्तिनपुरे रम्ये कुरूणां पुटभेदने।
वसन् … अन्वशाद् वै वसुंधराम्) 1. 94.
10; (6) Śaṃtanu, unwilling to agree to
the condition laid down by the Dāśa, re-
turned to Hāstinapura (प्रत्ययाद् धास्तिन-
पुरम्) 1. 94. 53; (7) Bhīṣma took Satya-
vatī on a chariot to Hāstinapura and repor-
ted to Śaṃtanu (आगम्य हास्तिनपुरम्
शंतनोः संन्यवेदयत्) 1. 94. 92; (8)
Bhīṣma having won the Kāśi princesses,
brought them to Hāstinapura (प्रययौ
हास्तिनपुरम्) 1. 96. 41; (9) Kings who
formerly collected wealth from Kuru kings
(wealth described in 1. 105. 16-18) were
made to pay it back as tribute by Pāṇḍu,
king of Nāgapura and the lion of Nāgapura
(तत् सर्वं प्रतिजग्राह राजा नागपुरा-
धिपः) 1. 105. 18; (ते नागपुरसिंहेन
पाण्डुना करदाः कृताः) 1. 105. 21; he then
returned to Gajasāhvaya (ययौ पाण्डुः …
पुरं च गजसाह्वयम्) 1. 105. 19; Bhīṣma
and others who lived in Nāgapura (नाग-
पुरालयाः) went out (of the town) a little
distance to receive Pāṇḍu 1. 105. 23;
Bhīṣma, delighted, entered the town Gaja-
sāhvaya with Pāṇḍu (विवेश गजसाह्वयम्)
1. 105. 27; (10) Pāṇḍu sent messengers to
Nāgapura to inform Bhīṣma and others
that he had resolved to repair to the forest
to lead the life of an ascetic; accordingly,
the messengers quickly went to Nāgapura
(गत्वा नागपुरं वाच्यं पाण्डुः प्रव्र-
जितो वनम्॥ … ययुर् नागपुरं तूर्णम्)
1. 110. 37, 40; (11) After the death of
Pāṇḍu, Kuntī and the Pāṇḍavas were
brought by the ascetics to Hāstinapura and
reported to Bhīṣma and Vidura (हास्तिन-
पुरम् आनीय … भीष्मस्य विदुरस्य च
निवेदिताः) 1. 90. 77; (नगरं नागसाह्व-
यम्॥ … गमने चक्रिरे मनः) 1. 117.
4-5; when the citizens of Hāstinapura
heard about the arrival of the ascetics they
were astonished; the people of Nāgapura
went out to receive them (श्रुत्वा नागपुरे
नॄणां विस्मयः समजायत॥ … निर्ययुः
पुरवासिनः) 1. 117. 9-10; (12) When
Pāṇḍu's श्राद्ध ceremony was performed
on the Ganges by Bhīṣma and others, the
citizens took the Pāṇḍavas, who had per-
formed purification, and entered the town
Vāraṇasāhvaya (कृतशौचान् … पाण्डवान् … ।
आदाय विविशुः पौराः पुरं वारणसाह्व-
यम्॥) 1. 119. 3; (13) Droṇa, insulted
by Drupada, decided to do something to
the Pāñcālas and went to Hāstinapura, the
city of the Kuru chiefs (जगाम कुरुमु-
ख्यानां नगरं नागसाह्वयम्॥) 1. 122.
11 = 1. 154. 16; the Kuru princes had come
out of Gajasāhvaya and were playing with
a wooden piece (tip cat) (निष्क्रम्य …
गजसाह्वयात्।क्रीडन्तो वीटया) 1. 122. 12
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 131. 17: वीटया यवा-
कारेण प्रादेशमात्रकाष्ठेन।यत् हस्त-
मात्रदण्डेन उपर्य् उपरि कुमाराः प्र-
क्षिपन्ति।लोहगुलिकयेत्य् अन्ये); (14)
Adhiratha sent Karṇa to Vāraṇasāhvaya
(to learn the science of missiles from Droṇa
(प्रस्थापयाम् आस पुरं वारणसाह्वयम्)
3. 293. 15; (15) After the battle that
ensued at the time of the स्वयंवर of the
Kaliṅga princess, Duryodhana, protected
by Karṇa, went from Rājapura to Nāga-
sāhvaya taking with him the princess (नग-
रं नागसाह्वयम्) 12. 4. 21; (16) Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra told the Pāṇḍavas that after enjoy-
ing themselves at Vāraṇāvata for some
time, they would return to Hāstinapura
(हास्थिनपुरं सुखिनः पुनर् एष्यथ)
1. 131. 10; (17) When Duryodhana and
others realized that the Pāṇḍavas were
really not dead, they blamed Virocana and
entered Hāstinapura (विविशुर् हास्तिनपुरम्)
1. 192. 13; (18) Vidura told Drupada
that the Pāṇḍavas and Kuntī would be
anxious to return to the town (Hāstina-
pura); that all the Kuru ladies, the
city and the country, anxious to see them,
were awaiting their arrival (इमे चापि नरर्-
षब्ःआः।उत्सुका नगरं द्रष्टुं भविष्य-
न्ति पृथा तथा॥ … कुरुवरस्त्रियः।द्रष्टु-
कामाः प्रतीक्षन्ते पुरं च विषयं च
नः॥) 1. 198. 22-23; the Pāṇḍavas, to-
gether with Draupadī and Kuntī, went
happily to the town Nāgasāhvaya (नग-
रं नागसाह्वयम्) 1. 199. 11; they slowly
entered the town Hāstinapura (नगरं
हास्तिनपुरम्) 1. 199. 14; when the Pāṇḍa-
vas arrived, the town as though burst with
curiosity (कौतूहलेन नगरं दीर्यमा-
णं इवाभवत्) 1. 199. 15; at the bidding
of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the Pāṇḍavas, with the
whole town (following them), entered their
houses (सर्वेण नगरेण ते।समाविशन्त
वेश्मानि) 1. 199. 22; this event is included
in Vaiśaṃpāyana's summary of the epic (ते
तत्र द्रौपदीं लब्ध्वा … हास्तिनपुरं
प्रत्याजग्मुर् अरिंदमाः॥) 1. 55. 22; (19)
Yudhiṣṭhira sent Nakula to Hāstinapura
to invite Bhīṣma and others for the Rāja-
sūya; accordingly Nakula went to Hāstina-
pura and invited Bhīṣma and Dhṛtarāṣṭra
(प्रेषयाम् आस पाण्डवम्।नकुलं हास्तिन-
पुरम् … ॥; स गत्वा हासिइनपुरं नकुलः)
2. 30. 53; 2. 31. 1; (20) Duryodhana saw
in the Sabhā of the Pāṇḍavas heavenly
(architectural) designs which he had never
seen in the town Nāgasāhvaya (तस्यां
दिव्यान् अभिप्रायान् ददर्श कुरुनन्दनः।
न दृष्टपूर्वा ये तेन नगरे नागसाह्वये)
2. 43. 2 (Nī, however, on Bom. Ed. 2. 47.
2: अभिप्रायान् देवादीनां क्रीडातत्स्थानाद्।
यभिनयप्रदर्शकचित्रादिगतान् आशयविशे-
षान्); (21) Duryodhana returned to Gaja-
sāhvaya sad after seeing the prosperity of
the Pāṇḍavas at Rājasūya (जगाम गज-
साह्वयम्) 2. 43. 12; (22) On reaching
Hāstinapura, Yudhiṣṭhira went straight to
the residence of Dhṛtarāṣṭra 2. 52. 22; (23)
While going to the forest Draupadī said
that fourteen years later the Kuru women,
with their hair loose, will enter Gajāhvaya
after offering water libations to their dead
husbands (मुक्तकेश्यो … एवं कृतोदका
नार्यः प्रवेक्ष्यन्ति गजाह्वयम्) 2. 71. 20;
(24) While the Pāṇḍavas were going out
of Gajasāhvaya, bad omens like lightning
flashes in the absence of clouds, shaking
of the earth occurred (निर्यत्सु गजसाह्व-
यात्) 2. 71. 25; (25) The Pāṇḍavas came
out of Gajasāhvaya to go to the forest
through a gate at Vardhamānapura (निर्य-
युर् गजसाह्वयात्॥वर्धमानपुरद्वारेणा-
भिनिष्क्रम्य) 3. 1. 8-9; (26) Yudhiṣṭhira,
while requesting the citizens to return, told
them that Bhīṣma, the king (Dhṛtarāṣṭra),
Vidura, Kuntī, and friends would still be
in the town Nāgasāhvaya (नगरे नागसाह्-
वये) 3. 1. 33; (27) Enraged, Dhṛtarāṣṭra
told Vidura that he would no more want
him (for consultations) to protect the
earth or the city (Hāstinapura) (महीम्
इमां पालयितुं पुरं वा) 3. 6. 17; (28)
When requested by Dhṛtarāṣṭra to come
back, Vidura returned to Gajāhvaya (पुनर्
आयाद् गजाह्वयम्) 3. 7. 17; (29) Kṛṣṇa
told Yudhiṣṭhira that since he was involved
in battle with Śālva he could not go to Hās-
tinapura even though he had heard about
the dice game (येनाहं नागमं तदा।
श्रुत्वैव हास्तिनपुरम् द्यूतम्) 3. 15. 22
(here Kṛṣṇa says that he had heard about
the game; but earlier he said that he knew
nothing about it 3. 14. 2, 14-16); (30)
Bhīma urged Yudhiṣṭhira to attack Gaja-
sāhvya with his brothers (त्वरमाणो ऽभि-
निर्यातु … अद्यैव गजसाह्वयम्) 3. 34. 80-
81; (31) Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhiṣṭhira that
he could get him his kingdom back (3. 48.
23) so that he could rule the earth from
Hāstinapura (ततस् त्वं हास्तिनपुरे … वसन्
। … प्रशाधि पृथिवीम् इमाम्॥) 3. 48. 26;
(32) The citizens (पौराः) who followed

should go to Vāraṇasāhvaya and kill the
Kauravas (गत्वा वारणसाह्वयम्) 3. 150. 8;
(34) Kṛṣṇa told Yudhiṣṭhira that after the
fulfilment of the contract (समय), let
Nāgapura await his arrival, for he was
sure to get back Nāgapura and the whole
kingdom (प्रतीक्षतां नागपुरं भवन्-
तं॥ … प्रपत्स्यसे नागपुरं सराष्ट्रम्॥)
3. 180. 34-35; (35) When released by
the Pāṇḍavas from the captivity of the
Gandharvas, Duryodhana left for the town
(Hāstinapura) (जगाम नगरं प्रति) 3.
235. 23; (स्वपुरं प्रययौ राजा) 3. 236. 6;
Janamejaya felt that Duryodhana, proud
as he was, must have found it difficult to
enter Hāstinapura (नित्याहंकारवादिनः।
प्रवेशो हास्तिनपुरे दुष्करः प्रतिभाति
मे॥) 3. 236. 3; (36) Duryodhana, humi-
liated by his adversaries, decided to fast
unto death (इह प्रायम् उपासिष्ये) and not
return to the town; he asked his brothers,
led by Duḥśāsana, to return to the town
(प्रयान्त्व् अद्य पुरं प्रति) 3. 238. 10-11;
(न ह्य् अहं प्रतियास्यामि पुरं शत्रुनिरा-
कृतः) 3. 238. 12; he wondered what he could
tell Dhṛtarāṣṭra after reaching Vāraṇāhvaya
(वारणाह्वयम् आसाद्य किं वक्ष्यामि जना-
धिपम्) 3. 238. 13; (37) When asked by
Janamejaya, Vaiśaṃpāyana told him what
happened after Duryodhana's return to
Hāstinapura (आगते हास्तिनपुरम्) 3. 241.
1, 3; (38) Kings of different countries and
Brāhmaṇas arrived at Dhārtarāṣṭrapura
to attend Duryodhan's Vaiṣṇava sacrifice
(आजग्मुः … धार्तराष्ट्रपुरं प्रति) 3.
242. 17; after the completion of the Vaiṣṇava
sacrifice (3. 241. 32), Duryodhana entered
Hāstinapura 3. 242. 24; joyful, he entered
the town (प्रविवेश पुरं हृष्टः) 3. 243.
6; (39) The spies of the Kauravas, sent
out in search of the Pāṇḍavas, returned to
Nāgapura (न्यवर्तन्त ते च नागपुरं
प्रति) 4. 24. 6; (40) While taking away
the cattle of Virāṭa, Duryodhana, if challen-
ged, was prepared to fight even with Indra
and Yama, but not return to Hāstinapura
without fighting out with them (को हास्तिन-
पुरं व्रजेत्) 4. 42. 18; (41) Aśvatthā-
man blamed Karṇa for boasting even be-
fore the cattle had reached Hāstinapura
(गावो … न हास्तिनपुरं प्राप्ताः) 4. 45.
1; (42) Devaputra (Arjuna) told Duryo-
dhana that he would not find refuge even in
Hāstinapura (न हास्तिनपुरे त्राणं तव
पश्यामि किंचन) 4. 64. 24; (43) The
Purohita of Drupada went on behalf of the
Pāṇḍavas (5. 5. 7, 18) to Nāgasāhvaya
town (नगरं नागसासाह्वयम्) 5. 6. 18;
(44) There was not enough space in Hās-
tinapura even for the principal kings and
their chief warriors who came to help Duryo-
dhana (न हास्तिनपुरे राजन्न् अवकाशो ऽभ-
वत् तदा) 5. 19. 28; (45) After his meeting
with the Pāṇḍavas, Saṃjaya returned to
Hāstinapura and quickly reported his arrival
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (संप्राप्य हास्तिनपुरम्)
5. 32. 2; (46) When Kṛṣṇa started for
Hāstinapura, strong, noisy, south-westernly
wind swept the town (प्रामथ्नाद् धास्ति-
नपुरं वातो दक्षिणपश्चिमः) 5. 82. 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra had ordered that the maidens
who would go out of the town to see
Kṛṣṇa would go without wearing the upper
garment (नगराद् अपि याः काश्चिद् गमिष्य-
न्ति जनार्दनम्।द्रष्टुं कन्याः … ताश् च
यास्यन्त्य् अनावृताः); the whole town with
all its women, men and children (सस्त्री-
पुरुषबालं हि नगरम्) was looking for-
ward to see Kṛṣṇa; flags, big and small
(महाध्वजपताकाश् च), were to be put up
in all directions and Kṛṣṇa's path was to be
sprinkled with water and freed from dust
5. 84. 16-18; Kṛṣṇa's visit to the town
Nāgasāhvaya to seek peace is referred to in
the list of the contents of the Udyogapar-
van as given in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan
(यत्र कृष्णो … संधिम् इच्छन् … स्वयम्
आगाच् छमं कर्तुं नगरं नागसाह्व-
यम्) 1. 2. 145, and also in Vaiśaṃpāyana's
account of Rāma's going on pilgrimage
(स गत्वा हास्तिनपुरम्) 5. 34. 5-6; (47)
Returning from Hāstinapura to Upapla-
vya, Kṛṣṇa reported to the Pāṇḍavas all
that had happened in his meeting with the
Kauravas (आगम्य हास्तिनपुराद् उपप्ल-
व्यम् अरिंदमः) 5. 145. 1; Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Kṛṣṇa to tell him (Yudhiṣṭhira)
what he told to Dnryodhana when he went
to Nāgapura (त्वया नागपुरं गत्वा);
Kṛṣṇa told him that having reached Nāga-
pura (मया नागपुरं गत्वा) he told
Duryodhana in the Sabhā what was true,
wholesome and beneficial for him (तथ्यं
पथ्यं हितं) but he would not listen
5. 145. 5-6 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 147. 6:
पथ्यं न्यायोपेतं हितम् उभयत्र जया-
वहम्); (48) Dhṛtarāṣṭra, while telling to
Duryodhana, the past history of the Kurus,
told him that Yadu, the son of Yayāti
and Devayānī, lived in Nāgasāhvaya and
humbled all the kings (अवसन् नागसाह्वये)
5. 147. 9; (48a) The camp of the Kaurava
army near Kurukṣetra looked like another

शिबिरम् आबभौ) 5. 153. 35; (यथैव
हास्तिनपुरं द्वितीयम्) 5. 196. 12; the
marching out of the armies from the
town Hāstinapura is mentioned in the

स्वयंवर of the Kāśi princesses, return-
ed to Hāstinapura with them 5. 170. 21;
(गजाह्वयम्) 5. 175. 19; when rejected by
Śālva, Ambā could not think of returning
to Vāraṇasāhvaya (न च शक्यं पुनर्
गन्तुं मया वारणसाह्वयम्) 5. 173. 2;
Akṛtavraṇa, father of Ambā's mother,
told her that if Bhīṣma had not carried her
away to Gajasāhvaya (न नयेद् गजसाह्-
वयम्), Śālva, afraid of Rāma, would have
accepted her 5. 176. 10; after Rāma and
Bhīṣma decided to fight with each other,
Bhīṣma returned to the town (Hāstinapura)
(प्रविश्य नगरम्) to report to Satyavatī
5. 179. 15; then Bhīṣma, with the blessings
for victory pronounced on him by her,
came out of Gajasāhvaya and went to the
battlefield at Kurukṣetra (निष्क्रम्य गज-
साह्वयात्) 5. 179. 15; (50) After the fall of
Bhīṣma, Saṃjaya returned from the battle-
field to the town Nāgāhvaya to report the
event to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (शिबिरात् संजयं
प्राप्तं निशि नागाह्वयं पुरम्) 7. 1. 7;
(51) After the fall of Karṇa, Saṃjaya
went to the town Nāgāhvaya॑Nāgapura॑

happened on the battlefield (गत्वा नागा-
ह्वयं पुरं) 8. 1. 17; (ययौ नागपुरम्)
8. 1. 25; (स हास्तिनपुरं गत्वा … जगाम
धृतराष्ट्रस्य क्षयम्) 8. 1. 26; (52)

Duryodhana, all women in Nāgapura would
cry loudly hearing the death of their loved
ones (सर्वा नागपुरस्त्रियः) 9. 26. 22;
(53) Saṃjaya, saved from the hands of
Sātyaki, left for the town (Hāstinapura)
in the evening (प्रातिष्ठं … नगरं
सायाह्ने) 9. 28. 39; he told Dhṛtarāṣṭra
that the old guards who took care of the
women of the royal family took the women
under their charge and had left for the town
(ततो वृद्धा महाराज योषितां रक्षिणो
नराः।राजदारान् उपादाय प्रययुर् नग-
रं प्रति॥) 9. 28. 63; the ministers of
Duryodhana took to the town women of
the royal family (ततो दुर्योधनामात्याः
 … ।राजदारान् उपादाय प्रययुर् नगरं
प्रति) 9. 28. 68; the gate-keepers and
guards of women (द्वाराध्यक्षा … दार-
रक्षिणः) took shining beds, costly bed-
covers with them and left for the town
(शयनीयानि शुभ्राणि स्पर्ध्यास्तरणवन्ति
च।समादाय ययुस् तूर्णं नगरं दार-
रक्षिणः॥) 9. 28. 69; other men also took
their wives to the town (अपरे जनाः।
स्वान् स्वान् दारान् उपादाय प्रययुर् नगरं
प्रति) 9. 28. 70; women who were not seen
in their houses even by the sun were seen
by people going to the town (यान्तीः पुरं
प्रति); (प्रययुर् नगरं तूर्णम्) 9. 28.
71-72; (54) Other men, including cowherds
and shepherds, afraid of Bhīma, fled to the
town (आ गोपालाविपालेभ्यो द्रवन्तो नग-
रं प्रति।ययुर् मनुष्याः); they looked
at each other in fright and ran to the town
(प्रेक्षमाणास् तदान्योन्यं आधावन् नग-
रं प्रति) 9. 28. 73-74; (55) Yuyutsu
saw that Duryodhana's ministers had
rushed to the town taking with them
women of the royal family; so, with the
permission of Yudhiṣṭhira and Bhīma-
sena, he too, who had not accompanied
the women of the royal family to the
town, sped his horses and entered Hāstina-
pura along with the women in the even-
ing (दुर्योधनस्य सचिवाः … राजदारान्
उपादाय व्यधावन् नगरं प्रति॥ … ततः

गच्छति भास्करे।प्रविष्टो हास्तिनपुरम्)
9. 28. 78, 81-82; Vidura asked Yuyutsu why
he had come back to the town, when the
king (i. e. Duryodhana) had not been able
to enter it (विना राज्ञः प्रवेशाद् वै किम्
असि त्वम् इहागतः) 9. 28. 85; Yuyutsu then
told Vidura that when Duryodhana went
away from the place of the camp, all people,
afraid, ran to the town (Hāstinapura); then
the superintendents of the women put women
of the royal family in chariots and ran
(to the town) due to fear; then he too,
took leave of the king (Yudhiṣṭhira) and
Keśava, and entered Hāstinapura to save
himself from public criticism (अपक्रान्ते तु
नृपतौ स्कन्धावारनिवेशनात्। … सर्वं
प्राद्रवन् नगरं प्रति॥ … स्त्र्यध्यक्षाः
प्राद्रवन् भयात्॥ … ततो ऽहं समनुज्ञा-
प्य राजानं सहकेशवम्। … प्रविष्टो हास्-
तिनपुरं रक्षल्̃ लोकाद् धि वाच्यताम्॥)
9. 28. 87-89; (56) Bhīma assured Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that he would break Duryodhana's
body to pieces with his mace so that he
would never again enter the town Vāraṇa-
sāhvaya (नगरं … वारणसाह्वयम्) 9.
55. 19; (57) The Pāṇḍavas sent Kṛṣṇa to
Nāgasāhvaya to pacify Gāndhārī who had
lost all her sons in the battle; accordingly
Kṛṣṇa went to that town (संप्रेषयाम्
आसुर् यादवं नागसाह्वयम्। … स प्रा-
यात् … तत् पुरम्) 9. 61. 38, 40; (जगाम
हास्तिनपुरम्) 9. 62. 31; he having reached
Nāgasāhvaya entered the town resounding
it with the sound of his chariot (नाग-
साह्वयम् आसाद्य प्रविवेश च वीर्यवान्।
प्रविश्य नगरं वीरः … ) 9. 62. 32-33;
having comforted Gāndhārī, Kṛṣṇa left
Hāstinapura to meet the Pāṇḍavas (जगाम
ह।शिबिरं हास्तिनपुराद् … ) 9. 62. 72;
(58) The whole town including children
was afflicted with grief (आकुमारं पुरं
सर्वम्) 11. 9. 8; Dhṛtarāṣṭra, with
Gāndhārī, Kuntī and other grieving Kau-
rava women, came out of the town (Hāstina-

निर्ययौ पुरात्); (निर्ययौ नगराद् दीनः)
11. 9. 7, 17; the artisans, merchants, Vaiś-
yas, and all sorts of working people followed
Dhṛtarāṣṭra in going out of the town

entered his own town (Hāstinapura) (स्व-
पुरं प्रविवेश ह) 12. 38. 30; praised

vaya (ततो वैतालिकैः सूतैर् मागधैश् च
सुभाषितैः।स्तूयमानो ययौ राजा नग-
रम् नागसाह्वयम्) 12. 38. 43; the descrip-
tion of the town when Yadhiṣṭhira entered
it is given in 12. 38. 45-49 (नरैः नगर-

after bathing in Dṛṣadvatī and performing
evening rites, entered the town Gajāhvaya
(ततः पुरं ते विविशुर् गजाह्वयम्)
12. 58. 30; (63) A certain Brāhmaṇa,
Śamyāka by name (12. 170. 2-3), had
formerly told Bhīṣma in Hāstinapura the
virtues of renunciation (त्याग) (हास्तिन-
पुरे ब्राह्मणेनोपवर्णितम् शम्याकेन)
12. 170. 23; (64) At the end of the dis-
course of Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira, Vyāsa
asked him to permit Yudhiṣṭhira to return
to the town (Hāstinapura) (पुरयानाय
त्वम् अनुज्ञातुम् अर्हसि); accordingly,
Bhīṣma permitted Yudhiṣṭhira to enter the
town (प्रविशस्व पुरं राजन्) 13. 152.

नगरं नागसाह्वयम्) 13. 152. 11; (प्रवि-
वेश … पुरं वारणसाह्वयम्) 13. 152. 13;
(65) After living in the excellent town for
fifty nights (उषित्वा शर्वरीः श्रीमान् पञ्चा-
शन् नगरोत्तमे), and remembering that
he had promised to Bhīṣma to return to
him at the commencement of Uttarāyaṇa
(13. 152. 10-11), Yudhiṣṭhira came out

ṣṭhira to permit Kṛṣṇa to leave for Dvārakā
(गच्छावो नगरं … गजसाह्वयम् अद्य
वै) 14. 50. 50-51; (Kṛṣṇa then asked his

वेश्मानि समलंचक्रुः पौराश् चापि) 14.
69. 13-14; the highways were decorated with
flowers and the town, filled with the noise
similar to that of the flood of the ocean,

उघनिभस्वनम्) 14. 69. 16; dancing and
singing, filled the town; the city was adorn-
ed by bards in thousands together with
their women; flags, moved by wind, as if

later, Vyāsa also arrived at the town Nāga-
sāhvaya (नगरं नागसाह्वयम्) 14. 70.

Aśvamedha horse, after wandering over
the earth as far as the ocean, turned
back and faced the direction of the town

येत्य पृथिवीम् इमाम्॥निवृत्तो ऽभिमुखो
राजन् येन नागाह्वयं पुरम्) 14. 83. 1;

Śakuni's son in the Gāndhāra country,
returned to the direction of the town Nāgā-
hvaya (न्यवर्तत ततो वाजी येन नागाह्व-
यं पुरम्) 14. 86. 1; (7) Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
before leaving for forest life, advised Yudhi-
ṣṭhira to look after the safety of the town
(Hāstinapura); he asked him to see that
it was well protected by strong ramparts
and arched doorways; it should have on all
sides high watchtowers, close to each other
with enough space for six persons to walk;
it should have sufficient entrances, large
in size; they should be well distributed and
protected by mechanical devices (पुरं

of Dhṛtarāṣṭra's departure, the citizens of
Gajāhvaya were very much grieved (दुः-
खितः पौरवर्गो गजाह्वये ऽतीव बभूव)

forest but to return to the town and be
with her daughters-in-law (वधूपरिवृता
राज्ञि नगरं गन्तुम् अर्हसि) 15. 22. 8;
(77) After the departure of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
the Pāṇḍavas, along with women, returned
to the town (पाण्डवाः … स्त्रीसहिताः सर्वे
पुरं प्रविविशुस् तदा); the whole town
Hāstinapura, with its women, old men and
children, then became cheerless, noiseless,
as after a festival (नगरं हास्तिन्पुरं
तद् अहृष्टम् इवाकूजं गतोत्सवम् इवाभवत्
सस्त्रीवृद्धकुमारकम्।) 15. 24. 13-14;
(78) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra in the forest was
surrounded by Yudhiṣṭhira and others, as
well as by citizens, he felt he was as though
in Gajasāhvaya as before (मेने … पुरेव
गजसाह्वये) 15. 31. 18; (रमे चाहं
 … पुरेव गजसाह्वये) 15. 44. 15; (79)

and Kuntī, Yudhiṣṭhira returned to the
town Hāstinapura (नगरं हास्तिनपुरं

ṣṭhira heard about the death of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Gāndhārī and Kuntī, he went out
(of the town) to the river Gaṅgā (निर्ययौ

मुः) 15. 47. 10-11; after offering water
libations to the dead (15. 47. 12), Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and others returned to town but
stayed outside it until they were freed from
impurity (शौचं निवर्तयन्तस् ते तत्रोषुर्
नगराद् बहिः) 15. 47. 13; on the twelfth
day he performed the श्राद्ध and gave
gifts (15. 47. 16) and then entered the town
Vāraṇāhvaya (प्रविवेषा … नगरं वारणा-
ह्वयम्) 15. 47. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra had lived
a total of fifteen years in the town (Hāstina-
pura) after the death of his sons in the
battle, and three years in the forest (एवं
वर्षाण्य् अतीतानि धृतराष्ट्रस्य धीमतः।
वनवासे तदा त्रीणि नगरे दश पञ्च च॥

(81) Consoled by Vyāsa over the death
of Kṛṣṇa and others, Arjuna returned to
the town Nāgasāhvaya (ययौ पार्थो नग-
रं नागसाह्वयम्) 16. 9. 37; (82) When

journey (महाप्रस्थान) he gave the king-
dom of Hāstinapura to Parikṣit and of
Śakraprastha to Vajra (परिक्षिद् धास्तिन-
पुरे शक्रप्रस्थे तु यादवः) 17. 1. 9; he,
along with his brothers, Draupadī and a
dog, left Gajasāhvaya on their great journey;
he was followed by the citizens and the
women of the inner apartments; all the
citizens then returned to (the town) (निर्य-
यौ गजसाह्वयात् … न्यवर्तन्त ततः सर्वे
नरा नगरवासिनः) 17. 1. 23-24; (83)
After completing his सर्पसत्र, king Jana-
mejaya took leave of the officiating priests

D. History:
As told by Mātali to Arjuna: The city
once belonged to the king of gods (Indra);
the Nivātakavaca demons practised severe
austerities, satisfied Pitāmaha (Brahma-
deva) and obtained as a boon this city for
their residence and for freedom from fear
of gods in battles (इदं वृतं निवासाय
देवेभ्यश् चाभयं युधि॥); Indra, out
of self-interest, agreed to what the demons
had asked for (विधत्तां भगवान् अत्रेत्य्
आत्मनो हितकाम्यया); the Nivātakavacas
then drove out gods from this place and
made the city their residence (ततो निवात-
कवचैर् इतः प्रच्याविताः सुराः) 3. 169. 28-
30); (निवातकवचा नाम दानवाः … प्रती-
वसन्त्य् उत) 3. 165. 10; 1. 2. 121; 5. 166.
34 (?).
E. Epic event: Arjuna, at the
instance of Indra, attacked the residence
of Dānavas riding the chariot driven by
Mātali (तांस् तत्र जहि कौन्तेय … ततो
मातलिसं युक्तंप्रादान् मे रथम्) 3.
165. 10-12; (दानवालयम् अत्युग्रं प्रयातो
ऽस्मि) 3. 165. 23; battle described in 3. 166.
7-23; 3. 167-3-169. 20; when the Nivātaka-
vacas were killed, their wives cried aloud in
the city (दारास् तेषां तु सर्वशः।प्राक्रो-
शन् नगरे तस्मिन्) 3. 168. 21; Arjuna
entered the town along with Mātali frighten-
ing the women by the loud sound of the
chariot; after killing Nivātakavacas, Arjuna
returned to the residence of the gods (ततो
मातलिना सार्धम् अहं तत् पुरम् अभ्य-
याम्) 3. 169. 22; (पुनर् मातलिना सार्धम्
अगच्छं देवसद्म तत्) 3. 169. 35;
(निहत्य … निवातकवचांश् चैव ततो ऽहं
शक्रम् आगमम्) 3. 170. 61; Mātali told
Indra the killing of Nivātakavacas 3. 170.
63; according to Indra, Arjuna's feat excell-
ed that of gods and Asuras (अतिदेवासुरं
कर्म कृतम् एतद् त्वया रणे) 3. 170. 66;
the incident is referred to on several occa-
sions: (1) In the list of the contents of the
Āraṇyakaparvan in the Parvasaṃgrahapar-
van (निवातकवचैर् युद्धं हिरण्यपुर-
वासिभिः) 1. 2. 121; (2) By Arjuna while
describing his feats to Uttara (अहं पारे
समुद्रस्य हिरण्यपुरम् आरुजम्) 4. 56.
11; (3) By Bhīṣma while addressīng
Duryodhana (एष पारे समुद्रस्य हिरण्य-
पुरम् आरुजत्।हत्वा षष्टिसहस्राणि निवात-
कवचान् रणे) 5. 48. 16; (4) By Bhīṣma
again while giving his estimate to Duryodha-
na about the heroes assembled on the side
of the Pāṇḍavas (दानवानां सहस्राणि हिर-
ण्यपुरवासिनाम्।हतान्य् एकरथेनाजौ) 5.
166. 34 (but this could also refer to the killing
of Paulomas and Kālakeyas of Hiraṇya-
pura2); (5) By Yudhiṣṭhira when he,
while lamenting over the death of Abhi-
manyu, referred to Arjuna's exploits (निवा-
तकवचाञ् जघ्ने कालकेयांश् च … ।हिरण्य-
पुरवासिनः) 7. 49. 16-17 (Kālakeyas seem
here to be identified with Kālakhañjas who,
with Nivātakavacas, lived in Hiraṇyapura1
5. 98. 5, 7); (6) By Jayadratha, frightened
by the vow of Arjuna (दानवानां सह-
स्राणि हिरण्यपुरवासिनाम्।जघान … देव-
राजप्रचोदितः) 7. 53. 22; (7) By Droṇa,
while reminding Duryodhana of Arjuna's
past exploits (निवातकवचाश् चापि … तेन
वीरेण निर्जिताः) 7. 160. 18; दानवानां सह-
स्राणि हिरण्यपुर्वासिनाम्।विजिग्ये पुरुष-
व्याघ्रः) 7. 160. 19 (but this could also
refer to the killing of Paulomas and Kāla-
keyas in addition to the Nivātakavacas of
st. 18).
F. Past event: While telling
Mātali about Hiraṇypura, Nārada mentions
the defeat of Indra several times at the
hands of the Nivātakavacas of Hiraṇya-
pura 5. 98. 7-8.

हिरण्यपुर
Hiraṇyapura2 nt.: Name of the town
of the demons called Kālakeyas (or Kāla-
khañjas) and Paulomas.
A. History: As told by Mātali to
Arjuna: A Daiteyī named Pulomā and a
Mahāsurī named Kālakā practised severe
austerities for one thousand divine years
of gods; at the end of their austerities they
received a boon by which they secured
less misery for their sons and impossibility
of being killed by gods, demons and ser-
pents: they also received the city Hiraṇya-
pura, made for the Kālakeyas by Brah-
man and occupied by the demons, the
sons of Pulomā and Kālakā (अगृह्णीतां
वरं ते तु सुतानाम् अल्पदुःखताम्।अव-

तैर् दिव्यरत्नमयैर् वृतम्) 3. 170. 3; full
of bright, heavenly and very attractive

सुरराक्षसैः) 3. 170. 8; hence avoided by
gods (अमरवर्जित) 3. 170. 10; but after
the demons were killed by Arjuna, the city,
whose rulers were killed, lacked all lustre,
became devoid of glory, was full of grief,
and was struck by sorrow and miserable
condition; it then did not shine as before
(तच् छोकयुक्तम् अश्रीकं दुःखदैन्य-
समाहतम्।न बभौ दानवपुरं हत-
त्विट्कं हतेश्वरम्॥) 3. 170. 58; usually

C. Characteristic:
As the city could move at will (see above
B. Description: (कामग, कामगम); it
could go underground and again rise high
above, and then again moving quickly and
obliquely submerge in waters (अन्तर् भू-
मौ निपतितं पुनर् ऊर्ध्वं प्रतिष्ठते।
पुनस् तिर्यक् प्रयात्य् आशु पुनर् अप्सु निम-
ज्जति॥) 3. 170. 24.
D. Epic event: Arjuna,
while returning to the residence of gods
after killing the Nivātakavaca demons,
saw on way the town Hiraṇyapura 3. 170.
1; on hearing from Mātali about the de-
mons occupying the town (3. 170. 8-10),
Arjuna asked Mātali to take him to
Hiraṇyapura so that he might kill the
demons; accordingly Mātali drove him
there quickly in the heavenly chariot 3.
170. 13-15; the battle between Arjuna and
the demons in the town described (3. 170.
16-50); when the demons were being
killed they employed माया of the demons
and flew up in the sky together with the
town (ते वध्यमाना दैतेयाः पुरम्
आस्थाय तत् पुनः।खम् उत्पेतुः सनगरा
मायाम् आस्थाय दानवीम्॥) 3. 170. 21;
Arjuna steadied the town along with the
demons and when broken by his iron
arrows it fell down on the ground 3. 170.
26-27; Mātali praised Arjuna for his feat
of destroying Hiraṇyapura,—a feat which
could not be accomplished even by gods
and Asuras 3. 170. 51-54; when the town
was destroyed and the demons were killed
(विध्वस्ते ऽथ पुरे तस्मिन् दानवेषु
हतेषु च) the women of the demons
came out of the town weeping aloud
in grief 3. 170. 55-57; Arjuna, after
destroying Hiraṇyapura and killing the
Asuras (हिरण्यपुरम् आरुज्य निहत्य च
महासुरान्), returned to Indra with Mātali
3. 170. 60-61; hearing from Mātali in
details the exploits of Arjuna, (हिरण्य-
पुरघातं च मायानां च निवारणम्),
Indra exclaimed ‘well done’ 3. 170. 63-64;
this exploit of Arjuna is referred to: (i)
by Bhīṣma, when he referred to the boon
granted by Nara and Nārāyaṇa to Indra,
while addressing Duryodhana (ताभ्यां च
सहितः शक्रो विजिग्ये दैत्यदानवान्॥नर
इन्द्रस्य संग्रामे हत्वा शत्रून् … ।पौ-
लोमान् कालखञ्जांश् च) 5. 48. 13-14 (in
the earlier account in 3. 170 Indra is not
mentioned as taking part in the battle);
(ii) again by Bhīṣma while reminding
Duryodhana about the exploits of Arjuna
(दानवानां सहस्राणि हिरण्यपुरवासिनाम्।
हतान्य् एकरथेनाजौ) 5. 166. 34 (this
could also be a reference to Nivātakavacas
of Hiraṇyapura1); (iii) by Arjuna while
telling Uttara his earlier exploits (अहम्
इन्द्रस्य वचनात् संग्रामे ऽभ्यहनं
पुरा।पौलोमान् कालखञ्जांश् च) 4. 56.
9 (actually, according to the account in
3. 170, Indra had not asked Arjuna to kill
Paulomas and Kālakhañjas (there called
Kālakeyas); Arjuna did this on his own;
Indra had asked him to destroy the Nivāta-
kavacas of Hiraṇyapura1 (3. 165. 10-11)
which is mentioned by Arjuna in 4. 56. 11);
(iv) by Yudhiṣṭhira when, while lamenting
over the death of Abhimanyu, he referred
to the feats of Arjuna (हिरण्यपुरवासिनः
 … पौलोमाः सगणा हताः) 7. 49. 17; (v)
possibly by Duryodhana while reminding
Droṇa of Arjuna's exploits (दानवानां
सहस्राणि हिरण्यपुरवासिनाम्।विजिग्ये
पुरुषव्याघ्रः) 7. 160. 19.
E. Simile:
When the demons were killed the town
Hiraṇyapura became unfit to be seen like a
pond with its elephants killed or like a forest
the trees of which had gone dry (हतनागम्
इव ह्रदम्।शुष्कवृक्षम् इवारण्यम् अदृ-
श्यम् अभवत् पुरम्॥) 3. 170. 59.

1. 126. 35-36; Karṇa whose head was
moist due to water of consecration as a
king of the Aṅga country was embraced
by Adhiratha (परिष्वज्य च तस्याथ
मूर्धानम् … अङ्गराज्याभिषेकार्द्रम्) 1.
127. 4; when Bhīma said that Karṇa did
not deserve to be a king of the Aṅgas,
Duryodhana retorted that Karṇa deserved
not only to be the king of the Aṅgas but of
the whole earth (अङ्गराज्यं च नार्हस्
त्वम् उपभोक्तुम्) 1. 127. 7; (पृथिवीराज्यम्
अर्हो ऽयं नाङ्गराज्यं नरेश्वरः) 1.
127 16; Karṇa is called the king of
the Aṅgas in various contexts: (i)
Śiśupāla calls Karṇa the chief of the
Vaṅga and Aṅga countries (वङ्गाङ्ग-
विषयाध्यक्ष) 2. 41. 9; (ii) Śalya refers
to the rulership of Karṇa of the Aṅgas
(अङ्गेषु … कर्ण येषाम् अधिपतिर् भवान्)
8. 30. 83; (3) While recounting the ex-
ploits of Karṇa, Dhṛtarāṣṭra mentions
Aṅgas (!) among the countries conquered
by Karṇa and made to pay tribute (सुह्मान्
अङ्गांश् च पुण्ड्रांश् च … यो जित्वा समरे
वीरश् चक्रे बलिभृतः पुरा) 8. 5. 19-20;
(4) When Jayadratha was subdued by
Karṇa in a wrestling bout, he (J.), pleased
with Karṇa, gave him the city of Mālinī in
the Aṅga country (प्रीत्या ददौ स कर्णाय
मालिनीम् नगरीम् अथ।अङ्गेषु) 12. 5. 6;
(5) Arjuna, during the period of exile,
visited all the holy places in the Aṅga,
Vaṅga and Kaliṅga countries (अङ्गवङ्ग-
कलिङ्गेषु … जगाम तानि सर्वाणि तीर्थान्य्
आयतनानि च) 1. 207. 9; (6) Aṅga country
mentioned among those which were con-
quered by Sahadeva before the Rājasūya
(यः काशीन् अङ्गमगधान् … युधाजयत्)
5. 49. 28 (however, according to 2. 27. 16-
18 it was Bhīma who subjugated Karṇa;
in 2. 28 where Sahadeva's expedition is
described there is no reference to the Aṅga
country); (7) The Kṣatriyas of the Aṅga
and Vaṅga countries mentioned among
those who brought riches by hundreds for
the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira (अङ्गा वङ्गाश् च
पुण्ड्राश् च … आहार्षुः क्षत्रिया वित्तं शत-
शः) 2. 48. 15-16; (8) Aṅgas and Vaṅgas
mentioned among those people who along
with their kings were present at the Rāja-
sūya of Yudhiṣṭhira and served meals (यत्र

अहम् अद्राक्षं यज्ञे ते परिवेषकान्) 3.
48. 18, 22; (9) The army of the easterners
protected by the ruler of the Aṅga country
and by Kṛpa marched out for the battle
(तद् अङ्गपतिना गुप्तं कृपेण च॥।प्रा-
च्यानाम् अभवद् बलम्) 6. 17. 28; (10)
When Ayutāyus and Dīrghāyus, the sons
of Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus, were killed by
Arjuna, the Aṅga warriors, riding elephants,
attacked Arjuna (अङ्गास् तु गजवारेण
पाण्डवं पर्यवारयन्। … हस्तिसादिनः)
7. 68. 31; (11) When Arjuna attacked
the army of the Saṃśaptakas (8. 12. 54),
the Aṅga warriors, riding elephants, along
with Kaliṅga, Vaṅga, and Niṣāda warriors
attacked him (कलिङ्गवङ्गाङ्गनिषादवीरा
जिघांसवः पाण्डवम् अभ्यधावन्) 8.
12. 59; (12) The Aṅga warriors, along
with Vaṅgas and others, riding elephants
and skilled in fighting with elephants,
attacked Dhṛṣṭadyumna (हस्तिभिस् तु महा-

धिनः।अङ्गा वङ्गाश् च … गजयुद्धेषु
कुशलाः) 8. 17. 1-3; (13) Sahadeva, after
killing the elephant of a Punḍra warrior,
attacked the elephant of an Aṅga warrior;
Nakula took on himself the fight with the
Aṅga warrior and his elephant; the Aṅga
warrior threw तोमरस् on Nakula; the
warrior (here called म्लेच्छ and Ācārya-
पुत्र) fell down along with his elephant;
at the death of this Aṅga warrior, other
warriors from the Aṅga country with their
elephants attacked Nakula (विवर्मध्वज-

mentioned among those who were killed
by Bhīma (कलिङ्गवङ्गाङ्गनिषादमागधान्

recounting Kṛṣṇa's exploits mentioned
Aṅgas, Vaṅgas and Kaliṅgas among the
countries which were conquered by him
in battle (अङ्गान् वङ्गान् कलिङ्गांश् च
 … अजयद् रणे) 7. 10. 15 (this incident
is not mentioned in the epic).
F. Past
events: (1) Lomapāda, a friend of Daśa-
ratha, was the king of the Aṅgas (लोम-
पाद इति ख्यातो अङ्गानाम् ईश्वरो ऽभवत्) 3.
110. 19; he, the king of the Aṅga country,
called his ministers and consulted with
them about the means to bring Ṛśyaśṛṅga
to the Aṅga country; he asked the courte-
zans to get Ṛśyaśṛṅga from his आश्रम
to his country by some means (ततो ऽङ्ग-
पतिर् आहूय सचिवान् … ।यत्नम् अकरोन्
मन्त्रणिश्चये॥।ऋश्यशृङ्गम् … आनयध्वम्
विषयं मम शोभनाः॥) 3. 110. 28, 31;
the courtezans deluded Ṛśyaśṛṅga by
various means and brought him to the
ruler of the Aṅgas (प्रलोभयन्त्यो विवि-
धैर् उपायैर् आजग्मुर् अङ्गाधिपतेः समी-
पम्) 3. 113. 8; enraged, Vibhāṇḍaka, father
of Ṛśyaśṛṅga, started towards Campā to
burn it along with the king and his (Aṅga)
country (जगाम चम्पां प्रदिधक्ष-
माणस् तम् अङ्गराजं विषयं च तस्य)
3. 113. 15; being honoured at various places
on his way to Campā, Vibhāṇḍaka calmed
down and, delighted, he approached the
king of the Aṅgas in his town (समास-
सादाङ्गपतिं पुरस्थम्) 3. 113. 18; (2)
Once, Vasuhoma was the king of the Aṅgas
(अङ्गेषु राजा … वसुहोम इति श्रुतः) 12.

man, once gathered flowers of heavenly
fragrance that fell down near her आश्रम
13. 40. 16; 13. 42. 7); just then she received
an invitation from the Aṅga country where
Prabhāvatī, the eldest sister of Ruci, was
the wife of Citraratha, the king of the
Aṅgas; Ruci put the heavenly flowers in her
hair and went to the residence of the king of
the Aṅgas; seeing those flowers Prabhāvatī,
the wife of the chief of the Aṅgas, asked
her sister for the flowers (तदा निमन्त्रकस्

the earth in rivalry with the king of the
Aṅgas (not named) gave up her nature
as earth and got lost; then the Brāhmaṇa
Kaśyapa steadied her—this was told by
Vāyu to Sahasrārjuna Kārtavīrya (त्यक्त्वा
महीत्वं भूमिस् तु स्पर्धयाङ्गनृपस्य

Aṅgiras m. (pl.): The descendents of
the sage Aṅgiras; the family was also
known as Āṅgirasa; often mentioned along

द्रम् आसाद्य … स तत्र … तापसानां परं
चक्रे सत्कारं भ्रातृभिः सह॥लोम-
शश् चास्य तान् सर्वान् आचख्यौ तत्र
तापसान्।भृगून् अङिगिरसश् चैव) 3. 114.
26; 3. 115. 1-2; (3) When Droṇa releas-
ed Brāhma astra to kill the Pāñcālas (7.
164. 79), great sages, led by Agni, came

acted according to Dharma and that it was
time for his death (हव्यवाहपुरोगमाः …
भृगवो ऽङ्गिरसश् चैव … त एनम् अब्रुवन्
सर्वे द्रोणम् … अधर्मतः कृतं युद्धं
समयो निधनस्य ते) 7. 164. 86, 88-89.
F. Past events: (1) As an example of the
Kṣatriya lustre and power pacified by the
Brāhmaṇas, it was pointed out that the
Aṅgirases had defeated the Nīpas (क्षत्रिया-
णां प्रतपतां … ब्रामणेष्व् एव शाम्यन्ति
तेजांसि च बलानि च॥नीपान् अङ्गिरसो
ऽजयन्) 13. 34. 15-16; (2) Bhṛgus and
Aṅgirases, along with Daṇḍa, are mentioned
among those who followed Hara (Śiva) and
Pārvatī when they started for Bhadravaṭa
when Skanda was anointed as the leader of
gods; they were on the right side of Hara
(तस्य दक्षिणतो भाति दण्डो गच्छञ् श्रिया
वृतः।भृग्वङ्गिरोभिः सहितो … ) 3. 221. 14;

the proper way of conduct; their defeat
was beneficial (to their opponent); they
often got angry with the king (अन्त्यजा
ह्य् अनिवर्तिनः।पुरस्कार्याः सदा सैन्ये
हन्यन्ते घ्नन्ति चापि ते॥अधार्मिका
भिन्नव्ट्त्ताः साध्व् एवैषां पराभवः।

Bom. Ed. 12. 101. 19: प्रान्तदेशोद्भवाः
कैवर्तभिल्लादयः; S. K. Belvalkar:

a people, mentioned in most cases along
with Vṛṣṇis, and sometimes also with
Bhojas and Kukuras.
A. Place: Residents of Dvārakā where
they lived after they fled from Mathurā
(see Epic events below Section D) (द्वा-
रकावासिभिश् … वृष्ण्यन्धकमहारथैः)
10. 12. 33; (also cf. द्वारकावासिनो जनाः 1.
210. 17).
B. Heroes referred to as chiefs
of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis: (1) Kṛṣṇa:

56. 2; (अन्धकवृष्णिनाथ) 6. 55. 95; (वृ-
ष्ण्यन्धककुरूत्तम) 7. 79. 1; (वृष्ण्यन्-

Andhakas (तथोग्रसेनस्य सुतं …
वृष्ण्यन्धकानां मध्यगतं तपन्तम्)
5. 47. 72.
C. Characteristics: (1) Their
close relationship with the Pāṇḍavas: The
Pāṇḍavas had no friends other than the
Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis and vice versa
(अस्माकं … मित्रम् अन्यन् न विद्यते।
परम् अन्धकवृष्णिभ्यः … ॥तथैवा-
न्धकवृष्णीनां॥।अस्मत्तो मित्रम् अन्यन् न
विद्यते॥) 7. 169. 48-49; it was on account
of their friendship with the Pāṇḍavas that
the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis did not pay them
tribute at the time of the Rājasūya (द्वौ
करं न प्रयच्छेतां … सख्येनान्धक-
वृष्णयः) 2. 48. 42; (2) Fortunate, strong,
and difficult to be assailed, the Andhakas
and the Vṛṣṇis had become prosperous by
being ever industrious ( … सुमहाभागा
बलवन्तो दुरासदाः।नित्योत्थानेन सं-
पन्ना नारदान्धकवृष्णयः॥) 12. 82. 8;
(3) The Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis were
not subjugated by Jarāsandha due to either
their policy or due to good luck (नयेना-
न्धकवृष्णयः।ते न तस्य वशं जग्मुः
केवलं दैवम् एव वा॥) 5. 50. 39; (4) All
the Andhakas and the Vṛṣṇis were attached
to Kṛṣṇa (सर्वे चान्धकवृष्णय्ः।त्वय्य्-
आसक्ता … ) 12. 82. 29; they relied on the
wisdom of Kṛṣṇa (वृष्ण्यन्धकाः … यस्य
प्रज्ञाम् उपासते) 5. 84. 4; Andhakas, Vṛ-
ṣṇis, and Bhojas were led by Kṛṣṇa; relying
on the counsel of Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa) they
subjugated the enemies and gave delight to
their friends (अन्धकाश् च वार्ष्णेयभोजाः
कौकुराः … ।उपासीना वासुदेवस्य बुद्धिं
विगृह्य शत्रून् सुहृदो नन्दयन्ति॥वृष्ण्य-
न्धका … कृष्णप्रणीताः) 5. 28. 11-12;
(5) According to Yudhiṣṭhira, Vṛṣṇis, An-
dhakas and all the Yādavas were like Indra,
spirited, who proved their valour, very
strong and who enjoyed pleasures (वृष्ण्यन्-
धका … सर्व एवेन्द्रकल्पाः।मनस्विनः
सत्यपराक्रमाश् च महाबला यादवा भोग-
वन्तः) 5. 28. 12; (6) Arjuna described
them as brave, high-souled, proud like lion,
very strong, capable of bearing the strokes
of गदा, परिघ and शक्ति, having arms
like परिघ, having strong arms (ये ते
शूरा महात्मानः सिंहदर्पा महाबलाः।
भोजवृष्ण्यन्धका … ॥गदापरिघशक्ती-
नां सहाः परीघबाहवः) 16. 9. 9-10;
(7) Vyāsa too called them high-souled
(दिष्तम् एतन् महात्मनाम्) 16. 9. 26;
(8) (According to Bhūriśravas, however,
the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could be trea-
cherous); he, therefore, while blaming
Arjuna for his misdeed asked him why
he regarded them as authority (वृष्ण्यन्-
धकाः कथं पार्थ प्रमाणं भवता
कृताः) 7. 118. 15.
D. Epic events: (1)
Viṣṇu was born among the Andhakas and
Vṛṣṇis for the advancement of धर्म
(धर्मसंवर्धनार्थाय प्रजज्ञे ऽन्ध-
कवृष्णिषु) 1. 57. 87; there in the lineage of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas he shone like the moon
among the stars (क्षिताव् अन्धकवृष्णीनां
वंशे … ।परया शुशुभे लक्ष्म्या नक्ष-
त्राणाम् इवोडुराट्) 2. 33. 17; (2) Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas mentioned among those who ap-
proached Droṇa to learn the अस्त्रस् (अभि-
जग्मुस् ततो द्रोणम् अस्त्रार्थे … वृष्णयश्
चान्धकाश् चैव) 1. 122. 46; (3) They came
to witness the स्वयंवर of Draupadī
(वृष्ण्यन्धाश् चैव … प्रेक्षां स्म चक्रुः)
1. 178. 8; (4) When Arjuna, during the
period of his exile, visited Dvārakā, the
Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas gathered in a
crowd on the main road to see him; he
was honoured by their sons and was greet-
ed by them (दिदृक्षवश् च कौन्तेयं …
नरेन्द्रमार्गम् आजग्मुस् … भोजवृष्ण्यन्-
धकानां च समवायो महान् अभूत्।स
तथा सत्कृतः सर्वैर् भोजवृष्ण्यन्धकात्-
मजैः। … सर्वैश् च प्रतिनन्दितः॥) 1. 210.
17-19; (5) A great festival of the Raivataka
mountain was observed by the Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas; they, along with the Bhojas, gave
gifts to thousands of Brāhmaṇas in that
festival (तस्मिन् रैवतके गिरौ।वृष्ण्यन्-

काश् चैव) 1. 211. 1-2; (6) When Bhojas,
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas heard the sound of
the भेरी sounded by the Sabhāpāla, they
were agitated; they left their food and
drink and rushed to the Hall; there the
great heroes among the Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas took their royal seats (क्षुब्धास् तेना-
थ शब्देन भोजवृष्ण्यन्धकास् तदा।अन्न-
पानम् अपास्याथ समापेतुः सभां ततः॥
 … भेजिरे … वृष्ण्यन्धकमहारथाः।
सिंहासनानि शतशः) 1. 212. 12, 14; (7)
When Balarāma declared his intention to
fight with Arjuna, Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas followed him (अन्वपद्यन्त ते
सर्वे भोजवृष्ण्यन्धकास् तदा) 1. 212. 32;
(8) Rāma and Keśava, along with the
chiefs among Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, and
Bhojas went to Khāṇḍavaprastha to give
nuptial gifts after the marriage of Su-
bhadrā (आजगाम … सह रामेण केशवः।
वृष्ण्यन्धकमहामात्रैः; एते चान्ये च
बहवो वृष्णिभोजान्धकास् तथा; सह

जैः संवृतः) 1. 213. 23, 29, 34; they were
received and honoured by Yudhiṣṭhira and
their gifts were accepted by him (तांश् च
वृष्ण्यन्धकश्रेष्ठान्; पूजयाम् आस तांश्
चैव वृष्ण्यन्धकमहारथान्) 1. 213. 38,
52; they enjoyed their stay at Khāṇḍava-
prastha and returned to Dvārakā after a
few days (°वृष्ण्यन्धकोत्तमाः।विजह्रुर्
 … ॥ … ययुर् वृष्ण्यन्धकमहारथाः) 1.
213. 53, 56; (9) Jarāsandha was neglect-
ed by Andhakas, Kukuras and Vṛṣṇis on
considerations of policy (कुकुरान्धकैः।
वृष्णिभिश् च … नीतिहेतोर् उपेक्षितः॥) 2.
17. 27; (10) Andhakas, Yādavas and
Bhojas had deserted Kaṃsa; similarly
Vidura wanted Dhṛtarāṣṭra to desert Dur-
yodhana (अन्धका यादवा भोजाः समेताः
कंसम् अत्यजन्) 2. 55. 6; later Kṛṣṇa
told the same thing (here Vṛṣṇis are men-
tioned along with Andhakas) to Bhīṣma
and others (कंसम् एकं परित्यज्य कुला-
र्थे … संभूय सुखम् एधन्ते … अन्ध-
कवृष्णयः) 5. 126. 39; (11) Having
heard about the Pāṇḍavas' exile, the Bhojas
went with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas to meet
them in the Dvaitavana (भोजाः॥।वृष्णयश्
चान्धकैः सह … समाजग्मुर् महावने)
3. 13. 1; (12) When Pradyumna was afli-
cated by the arrows of Śālva, the army of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas wailed loudly (हाहा-
कृतम् अभूत् सर्वं वृष्ण्यन्धकबलं
तदा) 3. 19. 2; (13) Pradyumna asked his
charioteer how he should face Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis who always vied with him
(अन्धकवृष्णयः।मया स्पर्धन्ति सत-
तम्) 3. 19. 28; (14) Sātyaki wanted
Vṛṣṇi, Bhoja and Andhaka heroes to kill
the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and earn fame
(सवृष्णिभोजान्धकयोधमुख्याः) 3. 120.
19; (15) Kṛṣṇa assured Yudhiṣṭhira that
Kukura and Andhaka heroes would carry
out his orders and they would be wherever
he wanted them to be (कुकुरान्धकाश् च।
एते निदेशं तव पालयन्ती तिष्ठन्ति यत्रे-
च्छसि तत्र राजन्॥) 3. 180. 31; (16)
Satyabhāmā told Draupadī that Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis were attached to her sons and
they loved them as much as they did Pra-
dyumna (भजन्त्य् अन्धकवृष्णयः।तुल्यो
हि प्रणयस् तेषाम् प्रद्युम्नस्य च भा-
मिनि॥) 3. 224. 14; (17) Many Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas and others followed Vāsu-
deva to Virāṭanagara to attend the marriage
of Abhimanyu with Uttarā (वृष्ण्यन्धकाश्
च बहवो … अन्वयुर् … वासुदेवम्) 4. 67.
24; (18) After advising Drupada to
send a messenger to the Kauravas, Kṛṣṇa,
along with all Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and
Bhojas returned to Dvāravatī (गते …
कृष्णे … सह वृष्ण्यन्धकैः सर्वैर् भो-
जैश् च शतशस् तथा) 5. 7. 1; (19) Kṛta-
varman went to Duryodhana to assist him
with an army numbering one अक्षौहिणी of
Bhojas and Andhakas (कृतवर्मा … भोजा-
न्धकबलैः सह।अक्षौहिण्यैव सेनाया
दुर्योधनम् उपागमत्) 5. 19. 17; (20)
Saṃjaya, while conveying the message
from the Kauravas told Yudhiṣṭhira that he
(Saṃjaya) would consider Yudhiṣṭhira's
living by begging in the kingdom of
the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis better than
waging a war for kingdom (भैक्षचर्याम्
अन्धकवृष्णिराज्ये श्रेयो मन्ये न तु
युद्धेन राज्यम्) 5. 27. 2; (21) Kṛṣṇa
told Duryodhana that he was not alone
but the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis were with
him; in the terrible form that he showed
in the assembly, Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis were
in front of him (इहैव … अन्धकवृष्णयः)
5. 129. 3; (अन्धका वृष्णयश् चैव … अग्रे
बभूवुः कृष्णस्य) 5. 129. 8; (2) Kṛṣṇa
assured Karṇa that if he came over to the
Pāṇḍavas, all Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis would
be at his feet; they would all follow him
(पादौ तव ग्रहीष्यन्ति सर्वे चान्धक-
वृष्णयः) 5. 138. 13; (सर्वे चान्धक-
वृष्णयः) 5. 138. 23; (23) On the first
day of the war, Bṛhadbala, together with
great warriors from the Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis
and Bhojas, guarded the right side of
the Kaurava army (महारथैर् अन्धक-
वृष्णिभोजैः … बृहद्बलः … बलं त्वदीयं
दक्षिणतो ऽभिपाति) 6. 20. 14; (24) Sātyaki
said to Dhṛṣṭadyumna that he deserved
to be discharged by the Pāṇḍavas and all
the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis (since he boasted
after killing Droṇa) (याप्यस् त्वम् असि … सर्-
वैश् चान्धकवृष्णिभिः) 7. 169. 11; (25)
Yudhiṣṭhira, dejected at the destruction of
the Pāṇḍava army by Nārāyaṇāstra, asked
Sātyaki to leave the battlefield along with
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas and return home
(सात्यके त्वं च गच्छस्व वृष्ण्यन्धक-
वृतो गृहान्) 7. 170. 26; (26) Kṛṣṇa told
Aśvatthāman that the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes did not at any time ask him to part
with his चक्र (वृष्ण्यन्धकमहारथैः।
नोक्तपूर्वम् इदं जातु) 10. 12. 33; (27)
When Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā after the
war, Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas came out
to meet him; Kṛṣṇa honoured them and en-
quired about their well-being (उपयातं तु
वार्ष्णेयं भोजवृष्ण्यन्धकास् तदा।अभ्य्-
आगच्छन् … ॥स तान् अभ्यर्च्य मेधावी
पृष्ट्वा च कुशलं तदा) 14. 58. 17-18;
(28) Abhimanyu had told Uttarā that her
son would go to the families of Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas and learn from them the Dhanur-
veda, the use of अस्त्रस् and the whole
Nītiśāstra (गत्वा वृष्ण्यन्धककुलं ध-
नुर्वेदं ग्रहीष्यति।अस्त्राणि च विचित्राणि
नीतिशास्त्रं च केवलम्॥) 14. 65. 24;
(29) When Vyāsa arrived at Hāstinapura,
the Kuru leaders (the Pāṇḍavas), along
with the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes, wor-
shipped him as was proper for them to do
and waited on him (तस्य (i. e. of Vyāsa)
सर्वे यथान्यायं पूजां चक्रुः कुरूद्-
वहाः।सह वृष्ण्यन्धकव्याघ्रैर् उपासां
चक्रिरे तदा) 14. 70. 11; (30) Janamejaya
asked Vaiśampāyana how the Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis were destroyed, and by whom
were they cursed (कथं विनष्टा भग-
वन्न् अन्धका वृष्णिभिः सह॥ … केनानु-
शप्तास् ते वीराः क्षयं वृष्ण्यन्धका
ययुः) 16. 2. 1, 3; Vaiśampāyana then
told about the curse of the sages, Viśvā-
mitra and others, to the effect that an iron
pestle would be born to Sāmba for the des-
truction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; accord-
ingly Sāmba gave birth to a large pestle of
the size of a किंकर (shaft of a chariot ?)
(वृष्ण्यन्धकविनाशाय मुसलम् घोरम्
आयसम्। … साम्बो ऽयं जनयिष्यति॥ …
साम्बो मुसलं तद् असूत वै।वृष्ण्यन्-
धकविनाशाय किंकरप्रतिमं महत्)
16. 2. 8, 15 (however, Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 1.
26: किंकरो यमदूतस् तत्तुल्यम्); (31)
King Āhuka declared that the Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, from the day of his declaration,
should not distil liquor in their houses
(अद्यप्रभृति सर्वेषु वृष्ण्यनहकगृहेष्व्-
इह।सुरासवो न कर्तव्यः सर्वैर् नगर-
वासिभिः) 16. 2. 18; (32) When the Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas were maintaining vigil over
their conduct, Kāla always moved round
their houses; many bad omens including
blowing of fierce strong winds, occurred
indicating the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas; also whitish pigeons having red
feet, goaded by Kāla, moved over their
houses; when the conch Pāñcajanya was
sounded in their houses, asses of harsh
voice brayed in response (एवं प्रयतमा-
नानां वृष्णीनाम् अन्धकैः सह।कालो
गृहाणि सर्वेषाम् परिचक्राम नित्यशः॥)
16. 3. 1; (उत्पेदिरे महावाता दारुणाश् च

पादाश् च विहगाः कालचोदिताः।वृष्ण्यन्-

16. 3. 6; (नदन्तं पाञ्चजन्यं च वृष्ण्यन्-
धकनिवेशने समन्तात् प्रत्यवाश्यन्त
रासभा दारुणस्वराः॥) 16. 3. 15; for
other bad omens see 16. 3. 3-5, 7, 10-14,
17; 16. 4. 1-5; (33) The Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, wishing to go out with their
wives, decided to go for a तीर्थयात्रा;
so they got ready food and drink, which
included meat and wine, which they took
with them; fond of liquor they went out of
the town in vehicles, or on horses and ele-
phants; they stayed at Prabhāsa; hearing
that they had settled near the sea, Uddhava
took leave of them; the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes saw Uddhava leaving them; the
food which was prepared for Brāhmaṇas,
they gave to monkeys; then a great
drinking bout began at Prabhāsa in which
musical instruments were played upon and
actors and dancers took part (ततो जिग-
मिषन्तस् ते वृष्ण्यन्धकमहारथाः।

(ततः कालपरीतास् ते वृष्ण्यन्धकमहा-
रथाः।अपश्यन्न् उद्धवं यान्तम्) 16.
4. 12; (ब्राह्मणार्थेषु यत् सिद्धम् अन्नं

तूर्यशताकीर्णं नटनस्तकसंकुलम्।

4. 13-14; (34) When Sātyaki severed the
head of Kṛtavarman, Bhojas and Andhakas,
goaded by the turn of Kāla, gathered round
Sātyaki (एकीभूतास् ततः सर्वे काल-
पर्यायचोदिताः।भोजान्धका … शैनेयं
पर्यवारयन्॥) 16. 4. 29; angered, they,
in a state of drunkenness struck Yuyu-
dhāna (Sātyaki) with pots from which
food was eaten; Bhojas then fought with
Pradyumna, who had intervened to save
Sātyaki, and Andhakas attacked Sātyaki,
and killed both of them; Kṛṣṇa then killed
those Bhojas and Andhakas who were in
front of him with the pestle which arose
out of the एरका grass held by Kṛṣṇa in
his hand; whoever of them held the एरका
in his hand, it became (a pestle like) वज्र;
the Andhakas, Bhojas, Śaineyas and Vṛṣṇis
killed each other with that वज्र-like pestle;
in the tumult, the son killed the father and
the father his son; Kukuras and Andhakas
fell down as do the flies in fire (ते तु

contemplating the destruction of Andhakas,
Vṛṣṇis and Kurus, thought it was time for
him to leave the world (स चिन्तयानो ऽन्धक-
वृष्णिनाशं कुरुक्षयं चैव … मेने ततः
संक्रमणस्य कालम्) 16. 5. 18; (36)
The Pāṇḍavas were very much grieved when
they heard from Dāruka the destruction of
Vārṣṇeyas, Bhojas, Kukuras and Andhakas
(श्रुत्वा विनष्टान् वार्ष्णेयान् सभोजकुकुरा-
न्धकान्।) 16. 6. 2; (37) Arjuna seeing
Dvārakā after the destruction of Yādavas
compared it with a river of which Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas formed the water (तां स
वृष्ण्यन्धकजलां … द्वारकासरितं तदा।
 … ददर्शार्जुनो धीमान्) 16. 6. 8, 10;
(38) Arjuna told the people of Dvārakā ga-
thered in the assembly hall that he himself
would take with him Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
to Śakraprastha; there Vajra would be their
king; when Arjuna left Dvārakā, servants,
elephant- and chariot-drivers of Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis, as also their sons, followed
him; many thousands of women of Bhojas,
Andhakas and Vṛṣṇīs, who had lost their
husbands left Dvārakā to follow Arjuna;
on their way to Indraprastha when they
were attacked by Mlecchas (also called
Dasyus 16. 8. 44, 47, 58, 60 or Ābhīras 16.
8. 45) the latter captured the women of
Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and took them away
(शक्रप्रस्थम् अहं नेष्ये वृष्ण्यन्धक-
जनं स्वयम्। … वज्रो ऽयं भवतां

धकवरस्त्रियः।जग्मुर् आदाय ते म्लेच्-
छाः) 16. 8. 10-11, 28-30, 34, 38, 61;
(39) On his way to Hāstinapura, Arjuna
told Vyāsa about the destruction of Bhojas,
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas due to mutual killing;
they fought each other with एरका grass; a
total of one thousand and five hundred
of them was killed (भोजवृष्ण्यन्धका
ब्रह्मन् अन्योन्यं तैर् हतं युधि।
 … त एरोकाभिर् निहताः … ॥हतं पञ्च-
शतं तेषां सहस्रं बाहुशालिनाम्।

तरम्) 16. 9. 9-11 (however, Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 16. 8. 11: पञ्चशतं सहस्रं
सहस्रगुणितं पञ्चलक्षाणीत्य् अर्थः);
Vyāsa consoled Arjuna by saying that the
great heroes among Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
were destroyed due to the curse of a
Brāhmaṇa and hence Arjuna should not
grieve over the event; it was ordained for
them (ब्रह्मशापविनिर्दग्धा वृष्ण्यन्ध-
कमहारथाः।विनष्टा … न ताञ् शोचितुम्
अर्हसि।भवितव्यं तथा तद् धि दिष्टम्
एतन् महात्मनाम्) 16. 9. 25-26; (40)
On reaching Hāstinapura, Arjuna informed
Yudhiṣṭhira what had happened to Vṛṣṇi
and Andhaka people (आचष्ट तद् यथा-
वृत्तं वृष्ण्यन्धकजनं प्रति) 16. 9. 38;
(41) Having heard from Vaiśaṃpāyana
about the battle fought with मुसल (i. e.
with एरका blades fortified with the parti-
cles of मुसल) in the family of Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, Janamejaya asked him what the
Pāṇḍavas did after that incident (एवं
वृष्ण्यन्धककुले श्रुत्वा मौसलम् आह-
वम्) 17. 1. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 16. 1. 11:

16. 1. 13 (= Cr. Edn. 16. 2. 2): मुसलैः
एरकालग्नैर् मुसलकणैः); (42) Indra
showed to Yudhiṣṭhira, Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes seated among the group gods Sā-
dhyas, Vasus and Maruts (साध्यानाम् अथ
देवानां वसूनां मरुताम् अपि।गणेषु

अन्धकारक
Andhakāraka m.: Name of a country
(देश).
One of the countries (देशांस् तत्र
प्रवक्ष्यामि 6. 13. 20) of Krauñcadvīpa;
it is related to the mountain Andha-
kāraka; it lies beyond the country Prāvara,
and beyond Andhakāraka country lies
Munideśa (प्रावराद् अन्धकारकः।अन्ध-
कारकदेशात् तु मुनिदेशः परः स्मृतः)
6. 13. 21-22. [For Andhakāraka mountain
see Vol. I. 288]

अन्ध्र
Andhra, Andhraka, Āndhra m. (pl.):
Name of a Janapada and its people.
A. Location: Listed by Saṃjaya among
the (northern) Janapadas of the Bhārata-
varṣa (अत ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध
गदतो मम 6. 10. 37, 5); (अन्ध्राश् च …
अन्तर्गिर्यास् तथैव च) 6. 10. 48; accord-
ing to Bhīṣma the people lived in the south
(दक्षिणापथजन्मानः सर्वे तलवरान्-
ध्रकाः) 12. 200. 39; Sahadeva also colle-
cted tribute from Andhras during his ex-
pedition to the south (see section C: Epic
events).
B. Characteristics: (1) Ac-
cording to Bhīṣma, the Andhrakas did not
believe in Dhātṛ being the supervisor of
all beings (अध्यक्षं सर्वभूतानां
धातारम् अकरोत् प्रभुः। … निरध्यक्षांस्
तु कौन्तेय कीर्तयिष्यामि तान् अपि॥ … सर्वे
तलवरान्ध्रकाः।) 12. 200. 33, 38-39;
according to Bhīṣma, Andhrakas, were sin-
ful and they led the life of dogs, crows,
ravens and vultures; they did not exist in
the Kṛta age, but were to be met with from
the Tretā age onwards (तलवरान्ध्रकाः …
एते पापकृतस् तात चरन्ति पृथिवीम् इमाम्
श्वकाकबलगृध्राणां सधर्माणो नरा-
धिप॥नैते कृतयुगे तात चरन्ति पृथिवीम्
इमाम्।त्रेताप्रभृति वर्तन्ते ते जना … )
12. 200. 39, 41-42; they lived like Dasyus
and were attached to objects of senses
(विषयवासिनः। … दस्युजीविनः) 12. 65. 15;
(2) Māndhātṛ asked Indra what was the
Dharma of Andhras (पल्लवाश् चान्ध्र-
मद्रकाः। … कथं धर्मं चरेयुस् ते)
12. 65. 13, 15; (the duties of Dasyus which
applied also to Andhras described by
Indra in 12. 65. 17-22); (3) Kṛṣṇa des-
cribed Andhraka warriors as furious, fond
of fighting, strong and of firm (?) hands
(अन्ध्रकाश् च … संरम्भिणो युद्ध-
शौण्डा बलिनो दृढपाणयः) 8. 51. 19.
C. Epic events: (1) Sahadeva in his ex-
pedition to the south before the Rājasūya
(प्रययौ दक्षिणां दिशम् 2. 28. 1; दक्-
षिणाभिमुखो ययौ 2. 28. 8; प्रायाद् …
दक्षिणां दिशम् 2. 28. 37) subjugated
Andhras and others by merely sending
messengers to them and made them pay
tribute (अन्ध्रांस् तलवनांश् चैव …
दूतैर् एव वशे चक्रे करं चैनान् अदाप-
यत्) 2. 28. 48-49; Andhrakas are mentioned
among those who attended the Rājasūya
(वानवस्यान्ध्रकास् तथा) 2. 31. 11; Kṛṣṇa
had seen the kings and the people of An-
dhraka and other countries serving at the
Rājasūya (यत्र सर्वान् महीपालान् … सचोल-
द्रविडान्ध्रकान्) 3. 48. 18; (2) Kṛṣṇa
told Karṇa that if he were to side with the
Pāṇḍavas, Āndhras and others would move
in front of him (पुरोगमांश् च ते सन्तु
 … आन्ध्रास् तालचराश् चैव) 5. 138. 25;
(3) The army which gathered round Dur-
yodhana for the battle was guarded by
warriors of Andhra and other countries
(राजचमूं … गुप्तां … द्रविडान्ध्र-
काञ्च्यैः) 5. 158. 19-20; (4) On the six-
teenth day of the war, Pāṇḍya king killed
many horses and horse-riding Andharaka
and other warriors (अश्वारोहान् हयान् अपि
॥।निषादान्ध्रकतङ्गणान्) 8. 15. 9; (5)
On the seventeenth day of the war, incited
by Sātyaki, Draviḍa, Andhra and Niṣāda
foot-soldiers pressed on Karṇa wanting
to kill him (द्रविडान्ध्रनिषादास् तु पुनः
सात्यकिचोदिताः।अभ्यर्दयञ् जिघांसन्तः
पत्तयः कर्णम् आहवे) 8. 33. 4 (elsewhere,
however, Andhras are said to be fighting
for the Kauravas (see No. 3 above and
the next); (6) Mentioned by Kṛṣṇa among
those who had sided with the Kurus to
help Suyodhana; they could not be defeated
by any one except Arjuna (अन्ध्रकाश् च
पुलिन्दाश् च … एते सुयोधनस्यार्थे सं-
रब्धाः कुरुभिः सह।न शक्या युधि
निर्जेतुं त्वदन्येन परंतप॥) 8. 51.
19-20; (7) When the horse of the Aśva-
medha went to Andhra and other countries,

38, 43), the Ābhīras consulted among
themselves and knowing that Arjuna was
the only warrior to escort the women,
thousands of them, equipped with sticks,
attacked Bhojas and others to loot their
wealth; they did not mind the threats of
Arjuna and kidnapped the women under his
charge; Arjuna struck some of them with
his arrows and when the arrows were
exhausted he killed the Dasyus with the tip
of his bow; but the Mlecchas succeeded in
taking away with them Vṛṣṇi women in
spite of Arjuna's effort to protect them

53 (Or is this to be read as वातजाम-
रथोरगाः ?)

आरट्ट
Āraṭṭa, Bāhlī̆ka m. (pl.): Name of a
country and its people; also referred to as
Pañcanada (8. 30. 62, 65-66, 74), Āraṭṭaka
(8. 30. 74), Bāhlī̆ (2. 47. 22; 5. 84. 6; 13.
106. 16), Jartika (8. 30. 14); perhaps also
as Bāhyālaya (? 8. 30. 61).
A. Name: Āraṭṭa (आरट्टा नाम ते
देशाः) 8. 30. 36; (आरट्टजान्) 6. 81. 31;
Bāhlīka (बाह्लीकदेशम्) 8. 30. 9; Bāhli
(बाह्लिजातानाम् 13. 106. 16; बाह्लिजातैः 5. 84.
6); Āraṭṭa and Bāhlīka identified (आरट्टा
नाम बाह्लीकाः) 8. 30. 40, 43; as people,
the two are enumerated separately (आरट्ट-
बाह्लिकैः) 6. 71. 16; 7. 35. 36; 7. 97. 26; 7.
132. 24; 7. 165. 79; once they are distin-
guished-Āraṭṭa as the name of the country,
Bāhlīka, as the name of the people (आरट्टा
नाम ते देशा बह्लीका नाम ते जनाः) 8.
30. 47; for Bāhlīka as name of the people,
cf. Śalya is called बाह्लीकपुंगवः 1. 61. 6;
Somadatta as बाह्लिकानां ऋषभः 5. 30. 19;
but the people are also called Āraṭṭaka 8.
30. 74, or simply Āraṭṭa 6. 71. 16, Āraṭṭā
(f.) 8. 30. 58; name Bāhlī̆ for Bāhlīka,
probably due to metrical reasons 2. 47. 22;
13. 106. 16; since the country was marked
by five rivers (see Section
C. Location
below), it was also known as Pañcanada
8. 30. 62, 74; (धर्मं पाञ्चनदम्) 8.
30. 65-66; name Bāhyālaya is doubtful;
the text reads प्रायो बाह्या लयाद् ऋते (8. 30.
61) (Arjunamiśra explains प्रायो बाह्या
यथोक्तप्रदेशबहिर्भूताः।लयात् मद्र-
देशात्, see Cr. Ed. Vol. 10, p. 267, Cr. App.
for 8. 30. 61); perhaps the text is to be
read as बाह्यालयाद् ऋते 'except those who
have their residence outside (the countries
Kurus, Pāñcālas etc. just mentioned before);
also cf. Editor's note on the stanza Cr. Ed.
Vol. 10. p. 687).
B. Explanation of the
name: A certain Brāhmaṇa had informed
the Kuru assembly that there were two
Piśācas named Bahi and Hlīka living on
the river Vipāśā; Bāhlikas were their
progeny; they were not Prajāpati's creation
(यद् अन्यो ऽप्य् उक्तवान् सभ्यो ब्राह्मणः
कुरुसंसदि। … बहिश् च नाम ह्लीकश् च
विपाशायां पिशाचकौ।तयोर् अपत्यं
बाह्लीका नैषा सृष्टिः प्रजापतेः॥ 8. 30.
41, 44; (of the two Piśācas, Bahi was
female, Hlīka, male, see Cr. Ed. Vol. 10 p.
687).
C. Location: (1) Listed by Saṃ-
jaya among the northern Janapadas of the
Bhāratavarṣa (अत ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान्
निबोध गदतो मम) 6. 10. 37; 5; (शैवला
बाह्लिकास् तथा) 6. 10. 52; (बाह्लिकास् … एते
जनपदा राजन्) 6. 46. 50; Arjuna subdued
them in his expedition to the north of Indra-
prastha (प्रययाव् उत्तरां तस्माद् दिशम्)
2. 24. 1; (2) The Bāhlīka country was
discarded by Himavant, despised by Gaṅgā,
Sarasvatī, Yamunā and Kurukṣetra (बाह्-
लीकदेशं … बहिष्कृता हिमवता गाङ्गया
च तिरस्कृताः।सरस्वत्या यमुनया कुरु-
क्षेत्रेण चापि ये॥) 8. 30. 9-10; (3) The
Āraṭṭa-Bāhlīka country was watered by
five rivers viz. Śatadru, Vipāśā, Irāvatī,
Candrabhāgā, and Vitastā with Sindhu as
the sixth (पञ्च नद्यो वहन्त्य् एता … ।शत-
द्रुश् च विपाशा च तृतीयेरावती तथा।
चन्द्रभागा वितस्ता च सिन्धुषष्ठा बहिर्-
गताः॥आरट्टा नाम ते देशाः) 8. 30. 35-
36; पञ्चानां सिन्धुषष्ठानां नदीनाम् ये
ऽन्तराश्रिताः।तान् … बाह्लीकान्) 8. 30. 11;
पञ्च नद्यो वहन्त्य् एता यत्र निःसृत्य
पर्वतात्।आरट्टा नाम बाह्लीकाः) 8. 30. 43;
one had to cross the rivers Śatadruka and
Irāvatī to reach Bāhlīka from Kuru country
(शतद्रुकनदीं तीर्त्वा तां च रम्याम्
इरावतीम्।गत्वा स्वदेशम्) 8. 30. 19,
21.
D. Its Capital: Its chief town was
Śākala (शाकलं नाम नगरम्) 8. 30. 14;
hence its people known as Śākalāvant (8.
30. 33); at the gate of the royal resi-
dence there was a वट tree known as Go-
vardhana and a quadrangular place named
Subhāṇḍa (गोवर्धनो नाम वटः सुभा-
ण्डं नाम चत्वरम्।एतद् राजकुलद्वा-
रम्) 8. 30. 12 (see Govardhana Vol. I.
p. 350, Śākala Vol. II. pp. 573-594 and
Subhāṇḍa Vol. II. p. 580 where read Govar-
dhanavaṭa in place of Śudarśanavaṭa).
E.
Its river and forests: The name of the river
flowing through the capital was Āpagā
(आपगा नाम निम्नगा) 8. 30. 14; in Bāhlīka
country there were forests of Śamī, Pīlu and
Karīra trees; the forests had comfortable
roads (शमीपीलुकरीराणां वनेषु सुख-
वर्त्मसु) 8. 30. 24; (यत्र पीलुवनान्य् अपि)
8. 30. 35.
F. People: Description: Dull-
witted (मन्द) 8. 30. 18; imprudent (अचे-
तस्) 8. 30. 55; dullards (?) (प्रतिरब्ध) 8.
30. 81 (Arjunamiśra explains: प्रतिरब्धाः
संरम्भेण ताडिताः सन्तो बुध्यन्ते, i. e.
“will understand things when they are
severely beaten”, see Critical Notes Vol. 10.
p. 687; Nī. Bom. Ed. 8. 45. 37 (36 ?) reads
प्रतिरथाः and explains हितवादिनि प्रति-
कूलाः गुरुद्रोहिण इत्य् अर्थः); arrogant
(अवलिप्त) 8. 30. 19; ill-behaved (अविनीत)
8. 30. 28; croocked (जिह्म) 8. 30. 60, 62;
rogue (जाल्म) 8. 30. 40; vile (नराधम)

ग्रामकर्कश) 8. 15. 10; wicked (दुरा-
त्मन्) 8. 30. 26; robbers (स्तेन) 8. 30. 73;
despicable (विकुत्सित) 8. 30. 47, 57, 9; (धिग्
इत्य् आह पितामहः) 8. 30. 65, 66, 74; low
(हीन) 8. 30. 26; outcastes (व्रात्य) 8. 30.
26; indulging in sexual relationshīp with
their own children (पुत्रसंकरिन्) 8. 30.
40 (this is how the word is understood by
the Editor of the Cr. Ed. (see Vol. 10,
686, note on 8. 30. 40) on the basis of
Caturbhuja's commentary where we read
अवन्तेषु (? अपत्येषु) उत्पादितापत्याः;
Arjunamiśra reads पुत्रसत्कारिणः and
explains पुत्रान् एव सत्कुर्वन्ति न देव-
ब्राह्मणादिकम्); dirt of the earth (मलं
पृथिव्याः) 8. 30. 68; whose धर्म
had perished (नष्टधर्म) 8. 30. 36;
(प्रनष्टधर्म) 8. 30. 37; good people
other than the Bāhlīkas know eternal
धर्म (धर्मं जानन्ति शाश्वतम्।नाना-
देशेषु सन्तश् च प्रायो बाह्या लयाद् ऋते)
8. 30. 61; (धर्मं पुराणम् उपजीवन्ति
सन्तो … ऋते पञ्चनदांश् च जिह्मान्) 8.
30. 62; there was no अधर्म for them
(तान् प्रति नास्त्य् अधर्म आरट्टकान् पाञ्च-
नदान् धिग् अस्तु) 8. 30. 74; indulging in
ungratefulness, robbing others of their
wealth, drinking wine, violating the bed of
their teachers—this was their धर्म
(कृतघ्नता परवित्तापहारः सुरापानं
गुरुदारावमर्शः।येषां धर्मः) 8. 30.
74; they were thus outside the pale of reli-
gion (धर्मबाह्य), impure (अशुचि) 8.
30. 11, and the mode of their life was highly
despicable (तेषां वृत्तं सुनिन्दितम्) 8. 30.
14; (तेषु वृत्तं कथं भवेत्) 8. 30. 33;
gods, manes and Brāhmaṇas do not accept
their offerings (न देवाः प्रतिगृह्णन्ति
पितरो ब्राह्मणास् तथा) 8. 30. 37; their
actions are fruitless (मोघचारिणः) 8. 30.
27; bereft of moral virtues (शीलवर्जित)
8. 30. 15; a Brāhmaṇa had heard that in the
Bāhlīka country people changed their castes,
i. e. a Brāhmaṇa became first a Kṣatriya,
then Vaiśya, Sūdra and barber, and again
a Brāhmaṇa; having become a Brāhmaṇa
he again became a Dāsa; in a family there
was one Brāhmaṇa, the rest behaved
as it pleased them; thus in the Bāhlīka
country, quite contrary to the rest of the
places, there was utter confusion as regards
धर्म (आगच्छता महाराज बाह्लीकेषु
निशामितम्॥तत्रैव ब्राह्मणो भूत्वा ततो
भवति क्षत्रियः।वैश्यः शूद्रश् च बाह्ली-
कस् ततो भवति नापितः॥नापितश् च ततो

भवत्य् एकः कुले विप्रः शिष्टान्ये काम-
चारिणः। … एतन् मया श्रुतं तत्र धर्म-
संकरकारकम्।कृत्स्नाम् अतित्वा पृथि-
वीं बाह्लीकेषु विपर्ययः॥ 8. 30. 52-56; a
certain chaste woman of the Āraṭṭa country
was abducted and molested by the Dasyus
(of that country); she cursed them to the
effect that since she was violated by them,
women in their families would become
wanton and that there would be no release
from the sin (सती पुरा हृता काचिद् आरट्टा
किल दस्युभिः।अधर्मतश् चोपयाता सा

वं घोरात् पापान् नराधमाः॥) 8. 30.
58-59; women of Bāhlīka were bright,
fair, beautiful in appearance, applying red

Dala, his younger brother, as king (ततो
विदित्वा नृपतिं निपातितम् इक्ष्वाकवो वै
दलम् अभ्यषिञ्चन्) 3. 190. 69; King Dala
addressed his kinsmen as Ikṣvākus; he
asked them to bring for him another
sharp arrow (anointed with poison) with
which he would kill Vāmadeva and do a
feat dear to them (इक्ष्वाकवो हन्त चरामि
वः प्रियं … आनीयताम् अपरस् तिग्मतेजाः
(सायकः)) 3. 190. 75; king Dala again
addressed his kinsmen as Ikṣvākus and
pointed out to them that he was checked
(by Vāmadeva) and was unable to release
the arrow (इक्ष्वाकवः पश्यत मां गृही-
तं न वै शक्नोम्य् एष शरं विमोक्तुम्)
3. 190. 77; Vāmadeva told Dala's wife that
she had saved the royal family and that
she should rule her subjects and the large
kingdom of Ikṣvākus (त्वया त्रातं राज-
कुलं शुभेक्षणे … प्रशाधीमं स्वज-
नं राजपुत्रि इक्ष्वाकुराज्यं सुमहच् चाप्य्
अनिन्द्ये॥) 3. 190. 80.

इन्द्रवत्स
Indravatsa m. (pl.): Name of a people.
Indravatsas mentioned among those
eighteen peoples whose kings extirpated
their kinsmen, friends and relatives; king
Dhāraṇa extirpated the Indravatsas (अष्टा-
दशेमे राजानः … ये समुच्चिच्छिदुर् ज्ञातीन्
सुहृदश् च सबान्धवान्॥ … धारणश्
चेन्द्रवत्सानाम् समुच्छेत्ता) 5. 72. 11, 16.

इलावृत
Ilāvṛta m.: Name of a Varṣa.
Ilāvṛta stands in the middle of the form
of a bow of which two Varṣas (viz. Airā-
vata and Bhārata) stand on the northern
and southern ends; there are in all five
Varṣas between Airāvata varṣa and Bhārata
varṣa (धनुःसंस्थे महाराज द्वे वर्षे
दक्षिणोत्तरे।इलावृतं मध्यमं तु
पञ्च वर्षाणि चैव ह।) 6. 7. 36; cf. 6.
7. 6, 35.

ईरिन्
Īrin m. (pl.): Designation of the des-
cendents of king Īrin ?
Mentioned by Nārada among the holy
royal sages (तस्यां राजर्षयः पुण्याः 2.
8. 7; एते राजर्षयः पुण्याः 2. 8. 25) who
were present in the Sabhā of Yama; there
were a hundred of them (ईरिणां वैरिणां
शतम्) 2. 8. 22 (Nī., however, seems to
take it to mean the name of a king; he justi-
fies the use of plural on the ground that
there were many Īrins, of the same form and
function, belonging to different Kalpas, cf.
his remark on Bom. Ed. 2. 8. 23: पुराणेषु
प्रायेणाधिकारिणाम् एव कीर्तनात् तेषां च
प्रतिकल्पं समानरूपकर्मत्वाद् अनेक-
कल्पं धर्मसभावासिनां तेषां बहु-
त्वं युक्तम्).

उड्र
Uḍra m.: See Oḍra.

उत्कल
Utkala m. (pl.): Name of a Janapada
and its people.
(1) Listed by Saṃjaya among the
(northern) Janapadas of the Bhāratavarṣa
(अत ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध गदतो
मम) 6. 10. 37, 5; (मेकलाश् चोत्कलैः
सह) 6. 10. 39. (2) In the epic war they,
along with Mekalas and others, showered
arrows and तोमरस् on Nakula to kill him
(मेकलोत्कलकालिङ्गा … ।शरतोमरवर्-
षाणि विमुञ्चन्तो जिघांसवः॥तैश् छाद्य-
मानं नकुलम्) 8. 17. 20-21.

उत्तम
Uttama m. (pl.): Name of a people ?
Bhīma in his expedition to the east,
south and north (ययौ प्राचीं दिशं प्रति
2. 26. 1; ततः प्राचीं दिशं भीमो ययौ
2. 26. 7; ततो दक्षिणम् आगम्य 2. 26. 10;
ततो हिमवतः पार्श्वे 2. 27. 4) conquered
the Uttamas when he went beyond Ayo-
dhyā and Gopālakaccha and then to the
foot of the Himālayas (ततो गोपालकच्छं
च सोत्तमान् अपि चोत्तरान् … व्यजयत् प्र-
भुः) 2. 27. 3; (since in 2. 27. 11 there is a
reference to Dakṣiṇamallas, and in 2. 27. 3
मल्लानाम् अधिपं चैव follows immedi-
ately after सोत्तमान् अपि चोत्तरान्, it is very
likely that उत्तरान् and उत्तमान् refer to the
northern and most northern Mallas; the
passage would then mean that Bhīma
conquered the king of Mallas, together with
the Uttara and Uttama Mallas; Edgerton,
however, takes Uttara and Uttama as
names of different peoples, see his note on
this stanza in Cr. Ed. Vol. II, p. 501).

उत्तमौज
Uttamauja m. (pl.): Name of a Jana-
pada (or Uttamaujas sg. ?)
Listed by Saṃjaya among the (nor-
thern) Janapadas of the Bhāratavarṣa (अत

Bhīma in his expedition to the east,
south, and north before the Rājasūya con-
quered the Uttaras along with the Uttamas
(सोत्तमान् अपि चोत्तरान्। … व्यजयत् प्र-
भुः) 2. 27. 3; (for other references and
an alternative explanation of the word see
Uttama).

उत्तरकुरु
Uttarakuru m. (pl.): Name of a द्वीप
and of the people residing there.
A. Location: Counted by Saṃjaya
among the four द्वीपस् on the four sides of
mountain Meru (तस्य (i. e. of mount Meru
6. 7. 8) पार्श्वे त्व् इमे द्वीपाश् चत्वारः सं-
स्थिताः प्रभो। … उत्तराश् चैव कुरवः)
6. 7. 11; to the south of Nīla mountain and
to the northern side of mount Meru (दक्षि-
णेन तु नीलस्य मेरोः पार्श्वे तथोत्तरे।
उत्तरा कुरवो राजन्) 6. 8. 2; the river which
arises from the juice of the fallen fruit of
Jambū tree makes a प्रदक्षिणा of Meru
and flows to the Uttara Kurus (तस्या जम्-
ब्वाः फलरसो नदी भूत्वा जनाधिप।
मेरुं प्रदक्षिणं कृत्वा संप्रयात्य्
उत्तरान् कुरून्॥) 6. 8. 23; it lies beyond the
countries occupied by Mlecchas, and
beyond the mountainous regions occupied
by Vidyādharas, Vānaras, Kiṃnaras, Kiṃ-
puruṣas; beyond the Uttara Kurus lie the
Kailāsa mountain and the Naranārāyaṇā-
śrama (देशान् म्लेच्छगणाकीर्णान् … ददृशुर्

मम् (3. 145. 12-13; 15-16; they are con-
ceived to be beyond mountain Meru and
the Nandana forest and below the world
of Soma 13. 105. 20, 23, 29; Arjuna in
his expedition to the north went up to
the Uttara Kurus but did not enter it; the
Uttara Kurus lay beyond the Śveta
mountain, the residence of Kiṃpuruṣas,
the Hāṭaka deśa, Gandharva deśa, Hari-
varṣa in the north (प्रययाव् उत्तरां

ding to Nīla. on Bom. Ed. 5. 22. 12: उत्तरान्
कुरून् हिमाचलाद् अप्य् उदग्देशान् स्वर्ग-
भूमिरूपान्); they are once distinguished
from the southern Kurus (i. e. the Kuru
country) 1. 102. 10.
B. Description:
Holy (पुण्य) 6. 8. 2; 13. 54. 16; delightful
(रम्य) 13. 105. 25; where Siddhas live
(सिद्धनिषेवित) 6. 8. 2; abode of those who
have done meritorious acts (कृतपुण्य-
प्रतिश्रय) 6. 7. 11.
C. Holiness: (1) The
land of the Uttara Kurus was meant for
those who had no expectations from all
beings, who did not eat meat, who had
abandoned the use of rod, who did no
injury to moving and non-moving beings,
who had become one with all beings, who
had no desires, no attachments, who were
free from passions, who were indifferent to
gain and loss, to abuse and praise (ये
सर्वभूतेषु निवृत्तकामा अमांसादा न्यस्-
तदण्डाश् चरन्ति।न हिंसन्ति स्थावरं
जङ्गमं च भूतानां ये सर्वभूतात्म-
भूताः॥निराशिषो निर्ममा वीतरागा लाभा-
लाभे तुल्यनिन्दाप्रशंसाः।तथाविधा-
नाम् एष लोको महर्षे) 13. 105. 27-28;
(2) One who donates household articles
(like bed etc.), having all qualities, to a
good Brāhmaṇa, who is learned and virtu-
ous, goes to the land of the Uttara Kurus
(नैवेशिकं सर्वगुणोपपन्नम् ददाति वै
यस् तु नरो द्विजाय।स्वाध्यायचारित्रगुणान्-
विताय तस्यापि लोकाः कुरुषूत्तरेषु॥)
13. 57. 33 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 57. 33:
नैवेशिकं गृहोपस्करं शय्यादि); (3)
Warriors who somehow got killed between
two battles in the epic war went to Uttara
Kurus (ये तत्र निहता राजन्न् अन्तरायो-
धनं प्रति।यथाकथंचित् ते राजन्
संप्राप्ता उत्तरान् कुरून्) 11. 26. 17.
D.
Characteristics: (1) The trees in the Uttara
Kurus have sweet and juicy fruits and
fragrant flowers; they bear fruits and flowers
in all seasons; some trees give any kind of
fruit according to one's desire and others
always yield milk which has six flavours and
is like अमृत; they also produce garments
and ornaments from their fruits; jewelled
ground in the Uttara Kurus is spread over
with thin golden sand; it is everywhere
pleasant to touch and is free from mud; men
who fall down from the world of gods are
born there; both men and women there have
similar form and virtues; they are born in
pairs; the women are comparable with
अप्सरस्; they drink milk, which is like
अमृत, of the milk-producing trees; since
they are born in pairs, they grow up to-
gether, are similar in form and virtues and
wear similar dress; they love each other
like the चक्रवाक birds; they are always
happy and live ten thousand and ten hundr-
ed years; free from disease, they are not
afflicted by sorrow; they never abandon each
other; when they die, very strong Bhāruṇḍa
birds, having sharp beaks, carry them away
and throw them in valleys; (this is a short
description of the Uttarakurus given by
Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra) (उत्तरा कुरवो

The juicy fruits of the Jambū tree called
Sudarśana, falling on ground, give rise to
a river which, after encircling the Meru
mountain, flows to the Uttarakurus; the
men living in the Uttarakurus happily drink
that juice and hence oldage never over-
takes them (तस्मिन् फलरसे पीते न जरा
बाधते च तान्) 6. 8. 23-24; (3) At the
birth of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and Vidura, the
people of the Kuru country became so pros-
perous and happy that they are said to have
vied with the people of the Uttara Kurus
(उत्तरैः कुरुभ्त्ः सार्धं दक्षिणाः कुर-
वस् तदा।विस्पर्धमाना व्यचरन्) 1. 102.
10; (4) In the Uttarakurus, Brāhmaṇas
who are not born the natural way, i. e.
whose origin is in the fire or mountain, de-
light with gods (देवैः सार्धं मोदमाना
नरेन्द्र।यत्राग्नियौनाश् च वसन्ति विप्रा
ह्य् अयोनयः पर्वतयोनयश् च) 13. 105. 25
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13. 102. 25: अग्नियौना
धृष्टद्युम्नवद् अग्निर् एव यौनं योनिर्
येषां ते); (5) King Kuśika having
seen the golden palace, looking like the
Gandharvanagara, and the wonderful
forest created by sage Cyavana wondered
whether he was bodily transferred to the
land of the Uttarakurus (अहो सह शरीरेण
प्राप्तो ऽस्मि परमां गतिम्।उत्तरान् वा
कुरून् पुण्यान्) 13. 54 16, 1-2; (6) Indra
showers all wishes on this land (यत्रोत्तराः
कुरवो … यत्र शक्रो वर्षति सर्वकामान्)
13. 105. 25-26; (7) The gate-keepers of
Harivarṣa told Arjuna that those were the
lands of the Uttarakurus and he could not
conquer their town; one who entered it
did not remain a man: no wars were fought
on the lands of Uttarakurus; even if Arjuna
entered the land he would not be able to
see anything, since no one with a human
body could see anything there (तत एनं
 … द्वारपाला समासाद्य … वचनम् अब्रु-
वन्॥पार्थ नेदं त्वया शक्यं पुरं
जेतुं कथंचन। … इदं पुरं यः

वर्तते॥प्रविष्टश् चापि कौन्तेय नेह
द्रक्ष्यसि किंचन।न हि मानुषदेहेन
शक्यम् अत्राभिवीक्षितुम्॥) 2. 25. 8-12;
(8) Formerly, women were not closet-
ed (in four walls), they moved as they
liked, and were independent; they united
with men other than their husbands since
their marriage as virgins, and in ancient
times that was not अधर्म, but धर्म;
that ancient धर्म, favourable to wo-
men, was still practised by people of the
Uttara Kurus (अनावृताः किल पुरा स्त्रिय
आसन् वरानने।कामचारविहारिण्यः स्व-
तन्त्राश् चारुलोचने॥तासां व्युच्चरमा-
णानाम् कौमारात् सुभगे पतीन्।नाधर्मो

 … पुराणदृष्टो धर्मो ऽयम् … उत्तरेषु च
रम्भोरु कुरुष्व् अद्यापि वर्तते॥) 1. 113.
4-5, 6-7; (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 122. 4:
अनावृताः सर्वैर् द्रष्टुं योग्याः।काम-
चारो रतिसुखं तदर्थं विहारिण्यः पर्-
यटनशीलाः स्वतन्त्राः भर्त्रादिभिर् अनि-
वार्याः।); where women behaved as they
liked, where men and women were not envi-
ous (यत्र स्त्रियः कामचाराश् चरन्ति।
यत्र चेर्ष्या नास्ति नारीनराणाम्) 13. 105.
26.
E. Epic events: (1) Pāṇḍu told
Kuntī that the ancient धर्म, applicable to
married women, was still followed among
the Uttarakurus 1. 113. 7 (see above
D.
Characteristics: No. 7). (2) The gate-
keepers of Harivarṣa did not allow Arjuna
to enter the town (see above
D. Characteri-
stics No. 6); they advised Arjuna to return;
he then told gate-keepers that he would not
enter the land that was prohibited for
human beings; he however asked for tri-
bute for Yudhiṣṭhira's Rājasūya sacrifice;
the gate-keepers then gave Arjuna heavenly
garments, ornaments and animal- and
deer-skins (न प्रवक्ष्यामि वो देशं
बाध्यत्वं यदि मानुषैः।युधिष्ठिराय
यत् किंचित् करवन् नः प्रदीयताम्॥ततो
दिव्यानि वस्त्राणि दिव्यान्य् आभरणानि च।
मोकाजिनानि दिव्यानि तस्मै ते प्रददुः
करम्॥) 2. 25. 15-16; Dhṛtarāṣṭra referred
to Arjuna's conquering the northern direc-
tion and the Uttarakurus and making them
pay tribute; he also said that Arjuna
brought wealth from them and made them
join his army (which is not reported earlier
in 2. 25. 15-16) (दिशम् उदीचीम् अपि चोत्त-
रान् कुरून् गाण्डीवधन्वा … जिगाय।धनं
चैषाम् आहरत् सव्यसाची सेनानुगान् बलि-
दांश् चैव चक्रे) 5. 22. 12; (3) Flowers,
brought down by waters flowing from
Uttarakurus, were brought for making
garlands as tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira by the
mountain peoples (उत्तरेभ्यः कुरुभ्यश्
चाप्य् अपोढं माल्यम् अम्बुभिः। … पार्व-
तीया बलिं चान्यम् आहृत्य प्रणताः स्थिताः)
2. 48. 6-7; (4) The Pāṇḍavas on their
way to Gandhamādana crossed the Uttara-
kurus and saw the Kailāsa mountain and
the आश्रम of Nara and Nārāyaṇa in its
vicinity (ते व्यतीत्य … उत्तरांश् च कुरून्
अपि।ददृशुर् … कैलासम् … ॥तस्याभ्याशे
तु ददृशुर् नरनारायणाश्रमम्) 3. 145.
15-16; (5) After the miracle of the
meeting of the dead warriors with their
living relatives, brought about by Vyāsa,
the dead returned to the place from
where they came; some of them returned to
the Uttarakurus (स्वानि स्थानानि भेजिरे॥
॥।केचिच् चाप्य् उत्तरान् कुरून्) 15. 41. 13,
15.
F. Past events: The sage Gautama
offered king Dhṛtarāṣṭra (who was really
Indra) the world of the Uttarakurus in lieu
of his elephant but the latter refused to re-
turn the elephant and accept the Uttarakurus
(यत्रोत्तराः कुरवो भान्ति रम्या … तत्र
त्वाहं हस्तिनं यातयिष्ये॥ … परं गन्ता
धृतराष्ट्रो न तत्र) 13. 105. 25-26, 28;
(2) In the long, twelve-yearly sacrifice of
the sage Agastya, when a difficulty arose
due to famine, the sage just said that what-
ever wealth was found in the Uttarakurus
all that should appear of its own accord at
the place of his sacrifice, and it happened
just as he said (उत्तरेभ्यः कुरुभ्यश् च
यत् किंचिद् वसु विद्यते।सर्वं तद् थ
यज्ञे मे स्वयम् एवोपतिष्ठतु। … इत्य् उक्ते
सर्वम् एवैतद् अभवत् तस्य धीमतः)
14. 95. 25-26.

jāṅgala and Kurukṣetra prospered (तेषु
त्रिषु कुमारेषु जातेषु कुरुजाङ्गलं।
कुरवो ऽथ कुरुक्षेत्रम् त्रयम् एतद्
अवर्धत॥) 1. 102. 1 (Nī., however, on
Bom. Ed. 1. 109. 1: कुरुजाङ्गलं देशः
कुरवः पुरुषाः कुरुक्षेत्रं तेषां वास-
स्थानम्); the Kuru country described
after the birth of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍu and
Vidura: it rained on time, draught-animals
as well as birds and animals were happy;
the cities were crowded with merchants
and craftsmen; there were no robbers and
no one took delight in unlawful acts; in
all parts of the Kuru country, Kṛta yuga
prevailed; people, free from pride, anger
and greed, helped one another to prosper;
there were tall houses and people sported in
rivers, ponds and forest tracts; people
of the southern Kurus as though vied
with those of the Uttarakurus (see p. 635
ff.); no one was wretched; women did not
suffer from widowhood; wells, gardens,
and assembly halls, and lodging places
for Brāhmaṇas were raised by the Kuru
people; the country prospered by obliging
other countries; the people celebrated
festivals at all times; one always heard
the words ‘give, enjoy’ in the houses of
the people and of the Kuru chiefs; in short,
the wheel of धर्म, set in motion by
Bhīṣma, prevailed in the land of Kurus

qualities; it was distinguished for its compa-
ssion, sympathy, kindness, non-cruelty,
straightforwardness, mercy, and truthful-
ness 5. 93. 5-6; according to the hereditary

(राज्यं कुरूणाम् अनुपूर्वभोग्यं क्र-
मागतो नः कुलधर्म एषः) 5. 146. 29;

येन समुद्धृतः) 11. 23. 24; Bhagavān
prophesied that when Tiṣya would arrive
again high-souled Bhārata kings, called
Kurus, would be born and would become
famous on the earth; there would be feud
for mutual destruction in the family of
those born of Vyāsa (पुनस् तिष्य च सं-

living in Hāstinapura, called Sāmba, told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that no king in the dynasty of
the Kurus was at any time, as the protector
of subjects, unpopular among them; he
assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Yudhiṣṭhira would
follow the footsteps of the ancient royal
sages in his dynasty like Kuru, Saṃvaraṇa
and Bharata (न जात्व् अस्य तु वंशस्य
राज्ञां कश्चित् कदाचन।राजासीद् यः

राजर्षीणां पुराणानाम् भवतां वंश-

द्ध libation, fame and the lineage (of the
Kurus) were established in him (त्वय्य् अद्य
पिण्डः कीर्तिश् च कुलं चेदं प्रतिष्ठितम्।
 … त्वय्य् अधीनं कुरुकुलं पिण्डश् च
श्वशुरस्य मे) 15. 44. 21, 25.
C. Members
of the Kuru family, who lived at Hāstina-
pura (or outside it 2. 52. 8, 25) and who
sided with the Kauravas: Dhṛtarāṣṭra told
Vidura that he did not rejoice at the destruc-
tion of the Kurus (न च प्रीये कुरुक्षये)
1. 1. 97; Janamejaya wanted to know from
Vyāsa the story of the Kurus and the
Pāṇḍavas to which he was a witness
(कुरूणां पाण्डवाणां च भवान् प्रत्य-
क्षदर्शिवान्) 1. 54. 18; Vaiśaṃpāyana was
to tell Janamejaya the account of the feud,
loss of kingdom, and war between the
Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas (कुरूणां पाण्ड-
वानां च यथा भेदो ऽभवत् पुरा) 1. 54.

योः) 1. 54. 24; 1. 55. 4-5; the Kurus could
not bear the glory, fame etc. of the Pāṇḍa-
vas (नामृष्यन् कुरवो दृष्ट्वा पाण्डवाञ्
श्रीयशोभृताः) 1. 55. 7; Bhīṣma asked all
the Kuru chiefs to perform the funeral rites
of Vicitravīrya (प्रेतकार्याणि … अकारयत्।
 … भीष्मः सर्वैश् च कुरुपुंगवैः) 1.

ऽश्रूयन्त सर्वशः) 1. 102. 14; Gāndhārī,
after her marriage, gave satisfaction to
all the Kurus (तुष्टिं कुरूणां सर्वे-
षाम्) 1. 103. 16; as the Kurus watched,
the sages disappeared after telling them
to perform the funeral rites of Pāṇḍu
and Mādrī (एवम् उक्त्वा कुरून् सर्वान्
॥।कुरूणाम् एव पश्यताम्) 1. 117. 32;
once the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas went out
for hunting 1. 123. 15; Pāṇḍavas, while
proceeding to Vāraṇāvata, bowed down to
all elderly Kurus (कुरून् वृद्धान्) 1. 133.
3; Vidura and other distinguished Kurus
followed them 1. 133. 5; the distinguished
Kurus might get angry when they knew
about the Vāraṇāvata incident 1. 134. 22;
Kurus prospered due to the marriage of the
Pāṇḍavas with Draupadī 1. 192. 17; the

Kurus—Bhīṣma told Dhṛtarāṣṭra (तथा
कुरूणां सर्वेषाम् अन्येषाम् अपि भारत)
1. 195. 3; Droṇa told Karṇa what was very
much in the interest of the Kurus; if his
advice was not followed, the Kurus would
soon perish (हितं तु परमं कर्ण
ब्रवीमि कुरुवर्धनं … कुरवो विनशि-
ष्यन्ति नाचिरेण) 1. 196. 27-28; the Kurus
were anxious to meet the Pāṇḍavas after
their marriage with Draupadī 1. 198. 21; all
Kurus gathered at Hāstinapura at the time
of द्यूत (समागताः कौरवश् चैव सर्वे
2. 52. 8); Pāṇḍavas met the Kurus who
had arrived from all sides (कुरुभिश् चापि
सर्वशः) 2. 52. 25; according to Vidura
many of the Kurus would follow Duḥśā-
sana to hell and that the end of the Kurus
was at hand (त्वाम् अन्वेतारो बहवः कुरू-
णाम्) 2. 59. 10; (अन्तो नूनं भवितायं
कुरूणाम्) 2. 59. 12; 3. 5. 9; 3. 48. 40; 3.
225. 24; according to Bhīṣma, the end of
the Kurus was not far since all of them were
under the influence of greed and delusion
(नूनम् अन्तः कुलस्यास्य भविता न चिराद्
इव।तथा हि कुरवः सर्वे लोभमोहपरा-
यणाः) 2. 62. 17; the second game of dice
could mean the end of the Kurus 2. 67. 16;
the priests of Kurus would recite Sāmans
addressed to Yama and Rudra (2. 71. 7)
when the Bhāratas would be killed in war
(हतेषु भारतेष्व् आजौ कुरूणाम् गुरवस्
तदा।एवं सामानि गास्यन्ति) 2. 71. 22;
in the opinion of Vidura the Pāṇḍavas were
stronger than the Kurus 2. 72. 33; Vyāsa
knew where lay the happiness of the Kurus
3. 11. 2; Vyāsa, if he had any mercy for the
Kurus, should advise Duryodhana (कौर-
वेषु दया यदि) 3. 11. 3; Maitreya asked
Duryodhana to do what was in the interest
of the Kurus 3. 11. 20; if Kṛṣṇa could
have spoken to Dhṛtarāṣṭra against द्यूत,
the धर्म of the Kurus would not have
suffered (अनामयम् स्यात् धर्मस्य कुरू-
णाम्) 3. 14. 11; all Kurus, except four
(the four include Karṇa and Śakuni),
shed tears when Pāṇḍavas started for the
forest 3. 28. 7; according to Draupadī that
was not the time to show forgiveness to
Kurus 3. 29. 34; Duryodhana exhorted all
the Kurus against the Pāṇḍavas (उद्योजयाम्
आस कुरूंश् च सर्वान्) 3. 35. 13 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 34. 14: उद्योजयाम् आस उत्कर्-
षेण स्वेच्छया तेषु तेषु दुर्गदेशादिपालन-
कार्येषु इष्टान् योजितवान्); Duryodhana,
surrounded by Kurus, shone like the moon
surrounded by the नक्षत्रस् 3. 226. 10;
soldiers of the Kurus (कुरुसैनिकाः) were
halted by the Gandharvas 3. 230. 6; Pāṇḍa-
vas, honoured by Kurus and their wives
and children (सस्त्रीकुमारैः कुरुभिः),
shone like fires in their midst (कुरु-
मध्ये) 3. 235. 19; Draupadī com-
plained to Bhīma that distress had over-
taken her defeating all Kurus, Pāñcālas and
Pāṇḍavas (कुरून् परिभवन् सर्वान् …
संप्राप्तो मम क्लेशो ह्य् अरिंदम) 4. 19.
11; Balarāma wished that some one went
to Hāstinapura to strive for conciliation
between Kurus and Pāṇḍavas (शमार्थं
कुरुपाण्डवानाम्) 5. 2. 4; according to
Kṛṣṇa, the relations of Yādavas with Kurus
and Pāṇḍavas ought to be the same, no
matter how they behaved (संबन्धकं
तुल्यम् अस्माकं कुरुपाण्डुषु) 5. 5. 3;
if the chief of the Kurus (Dhṛtarāṣṭra ?)
would behave justly, large scale destruction
could be avoided by the good brotherli-
ness between Kurus and Pāṇḍavas (न
भवेत् कुरुपाण्डूनाम् सौभ्रात्रेण महान्
क्षयः) 5. 5. 8; the whole earth was
agitated due to (the feud between) the
Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas (कुरुपाण्डव-
कारणात्) 5. 5. 16; Drupada sent his priest
to the Kurus 5. 5. 18; the Pāṇḍavas desired
peace, and not conflict, with the Kurus
5. 20. 12, 64; Yudhiṣṭhira hoped that the
Kurus did not talk ill of the Pāṇḍavas 5.
23. 19; what Saṃjaya wanted to say was
for the prosperity of the Kurus 5. 25. 3, 8;
according Saṃjaya if the Pāṇḍavas wanted
to discipline the Kurus (by killing them),
Pāṇḍavas' being alive would be as good as
their death (ते चेत् कुरून् अनुशास्य स्थ पार्-
थाः … समं वस् तज् जीवितं मृत्युना स्यात्)
5. 25. 9; according to Saṃjaya who could
face the attack of the Kurus when prote-
cted by Droṇa Bhīṣma and others ? 5.
25. 11; Saṃjaya begged the Pāṇḍavas and
others to see where lay the welfare
of the Kurus and the Sṛñjayas (कथं
स्वस्ति स्यात् कुरुसृञ्जयानाम्) 5. 25. 14;
Yudhiṣṭhira to Saṃjaya: Why should
Dhṛtarāṣṭra desire to separate the Pāṇḍa-
vas from the Kurus ? Vidura wished wel-
fare of the Kurus, but Dhṛtarāṣṭra did not
remember him from among the Kurus; while
playing the game of dice, Vidura wonder-
ed if disaster was in store for the Kurus;
when the Kurus followed the advice of
Vidura, calamity did not strike the Kurus;
on the other hand, their kingdom prospered;
if Vidura was kept out, how could welfare
come to the Kurus and the Sṛñjayas
(कथं स्वस्ति स्यात् कुरुसृञ्जयानाम्);
all the Kurus-including Karṇa, Duryo-
dhan, Droṇa and Bhīṣma—knew that
there was no archer like Arjuna 5. 26. 7,
12, 15-16, 18, 21-22; Kṛṣṇa to Saṃjaya:
If all the Kurus, young and old, had pre-
vented Duḥśāsana, it would have pleased
Kṛṣṇa (सकुमारवृद्धाः … कुरवः); if
Kṛṣṇa could establish peace with the Kurus,
they would be saved from the bond of death;
he would approach the Kurus if they would
be willing to respect him 5. 29. 32, 41-42;
Yudhiṣṭhira wished well for the Kuru
chiefs (कुरुमुख्या युवानः) as also for
their Dāsas and the sons of Dāsas (दासी-
पुत्रा ये च दासाः कुरूणाम्) 5. 30. 22, 37; the
Pāṇḍavas, though stronger than the Kurus,
had patiently borne the hardships—this
was known to the Kurus 5. 31. 14; the
counsellors of the Kurus were convinced
that a hell had been let loose for the des-
truction of the Kurus (कुरुक्षयार्थे
निरयो व्यपादि) 5. 32. 20 (Nī. who reads
नियमेनोदपादि (Bom. Ed. 5. 32. 21) para-
phrases as नियमेन उत्पन्नः); Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra requested Vidura to tell him what
was beneficial for the Kurus 5. 34. 2, 5;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was one on whom the Kuru
family depended (त्वय्य् आधीनं कुरु-
कुलम्) 5. 36. 71; the Kurus would witness
the destruction of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
in case of war (प्रत्यक्षं वः कुरवः)
5. 47. 90; all the Kurus would be long-
lived if they followed the advise of Bhīṣma
and others 5. 47. 103; otherwise, annihila-
tion was in store of the Kurus (नो चेद्
अयम् अभावः स्यात् कुरूणाम्) 5. 48. 25;
Jarāsandha could not subdue the Kurus 5.
50. 39; Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that destruction of
the Kurus was certain 5. 50. 36, 57, 59; he
advised the Kurus not to confront the
Pāṇḍavas if they wanted to avoid destru-
ction of the whole family 5. 52. 14; many
kings blamed Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and the Kurus,
(व्यगर्हयंश् च संगम्य भवन्तं
कुरुभिः सह) 5. 54. 4; Saṃjaya was to
tell the Kurus and others to deal justly
with Yudhiṣṭhira 5. 56. 56; all the Kurus
were of the opinion that peace with
the Pāṇḍavas meant acting according to
धर्म (एतद् धि कुरवः सर्वे मन्यन्ते
धर्मसंहितं) 5. 57. 4; Kurus were
inferior to the Pāṇḍavas in point of
strength and lustre, both divine and human
(देवमानुषयोः शक्त्या तेजसा चैव
पाण्डवान्।कुरून् शक्त्याल्पतरया) 5.
59. 4; Agni would help the Pāṇḍavas
in war between them and the Kurus 5.
59. 8; brooding over peace between Kurus
(and Pāṇḍavas) Dhṛtarāṣṭra passed sleep-
less nights; he felt destruction of the
Kurus was at hand, for he always rated
Pāṇḍavas stronger than Kurus 5. 59. 21-23;
he wanted Duryodhana to listen to him
whose advice was in the interest of the
Kurus (कुरूणाम् अर्थवादिनम्) 5. 63. 12;
Kṛṣṇa wished to release the agitated Kurus
and Sṛñjayas from the noose of death
(संरब्धान् कुरुसृञ्जयान्) 5. 70. 81;
Yudhiṣṭhira initially did not approve of
Kṛṣṇa's approaching the Kurus 5. 70. 82;
Kṛṣṇa would burn all the Kurus if they
tried to do anything improper to him 5. 70.
87; if Kṛṣṇa, while striving for peace, did
not get any response which would be in
accord with धर्म (न धर्मं तत्र
लप्स्यसे), all kings would blame Kurus 5.
71. 30, 32; Kṛṣṇa warned Kauravas that
fierce war was certain 5. 75. 17; Bhīma did
not want Kṛṣṇa to incite the Kurus for war;
he remembered that at one time they lived
happily together with the Kurus and their
sons (कुरवः सहपुत्रास् तथा वयम्);
he wanted Kṛṣṇa to act in such a way
that the Pāṇḍavas could remain neutral
with the Kurus and that Kurus did not
resort to an unjust course (अप्य् उदासीन-
वृत्तिः स्याद् यथा नः कुरुभिः सह।
वासुदेव तथा कार्यं न कुरून् अनयः
स्पृशेत्) 5. 72. 1, 9, 21; Kṛṣṇa was a great
friend of Kurus and Pāṇḍavas; he could
lead them to well-being (निरामयम्) 5.
76. 7-8; 5. 81. 1; but Sahadeva wanted
Kṛṣṇa to strive for war between Kurus
and Pāṇḍavas even if the former sought
peace 5. 79. 2; Kṛṣṇa would strive to do
that what was just and beneficial to the
Pāṇḍavas and well-being of the Kurus
(धर्म्यम् अस्मद्धितं चैव कुरूणाम्
यद् अनामयम्) 5. 81. 5; Kṛṣṇa left for
Hāstinapura, the seat of the Kurus (कुरू-
णां सदनं) 5. 81. 29; (कुरुसद्मन्)
5. 83. 18; Duryodhana in his house
was surrounded by Kurus 5. 89. 4; there
the Kurus waited on Kṛṣṇa 5. 89. 36;
Kṛṣṇa approached by the Kurus in Vidura's
house; they offered him their houses and
treasures; when Kurus left, Vidura wor-
shipped Kṛṣṇa 5. 89. 35-36, 38; Kṛṣṇa
assured Vidura that he would try for
conciliation between Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas who would (otherwise) perish in
war 5. 91. 8; great calamity loomed large
over the Kurus who followed Karṇa and
Duryodhana 5. 91. 9; 5. 93. 11; Kṛṣṇa tried
for conciliation lest he was blamed (by
others) for not checking, though capable,
the agitated Kurus and Pāṇḍavas 5. 91. 16;
Kṛṣṇa wished that the Kurus honoured him
5. 91. 20; Kurus, led by Bhīṣma, reached the
Sabhā 5. 92. 8; they surrounded Kṛṣṇa
when he started for the Sabhā; the whole
town of the Kurus desired to see Kṛṣṇa
whose chariot moved on the road (पुरं
कुरूणां संवृत्तं द्रष्टुकामं जनार्द-
नम् 5. 92. 14, 24; Kṛṣṇa went to the Kuru-
assembly to establish peace between the
Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas 5. 93. 3; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, as the seniormost among the Kurus
(श्रेष्ठः कुरूणां), could control them
if they misbehaved 5. 93. 8; if Dhṛtarāṣṭra
could restrain his sons (5. 93. 13), he,
supported by the Kurus and the Pāṇḍa-
vas, could become the lord of the world
5. 93. 22; Kaṇva advised Duryodhana to
be reconciled to the Pāṇḍavas so that they
and the Kurus might protect the earth 5. 95.
8; Gāndhārī advised Duryodhana not to
be responsible for the killing of the Kurus
5. 127. 49; Dhṛtarāṣṭra desired and strove
for conciliation between the Kurus (and
the Pāṇḍavas) and that was known to all
the Kurus 5. 129. 26, 28; Duryodhana
should not think of war but should think
of peace for the prosperity of the Kurus
(अलं युद्धेन … शाम्य त्वं कुरु-
वृद्धये) 5. 137. 22; Karṇa felt that the
war between the Kurus and Pāṇḍavas was
certain and that there were astronomical
conjunctions foreboding great danger for
the Kurus (विशेषेण हि वार्ष्णेय चित्रां
पीडयते ग्रहः) 5. 141. 3, 9; Vidura
wondered that when the धर्म was
being forcibly driven away by the Kurus,
who could not be afflicted; the unlawful act
of the Kurus would cause destruction of the
heroes 5. 142. 8-9; Kuntī wished that the
Kurus saw the coming together of Karṇa
and Arjuna as good brothers 5. 143. 9;
according to Karṇa, Bhīṣma always wished
ill of the Kurus, but Duryodhana did not
realize it (कुरूणाम् अहितो नित्यम् न च
राजावबुध्यते) 5. 165. 12; Bhīṣma felt that
by their association with Karṇa, the Kurus
had very much gone astray (कुरूणाम्
अनयो महान्) 5. 166. 8; Vyāsa assured
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that he would make known the
fame of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas 6. 2.
13; he told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that there was
nothing like permanent for his kinsmen,
(as well as) for the Kurus (नेह विद्यति
शाश्वतम्।ज्ञातीनां च कुरूणां च) 6. 4.
3; for the Kurus as well as for the Pāṇḍavas,
Vyāsa was their धर्म, purification, glory,
fame, forbearance, and स्मृति; he was
their respected grand-sire (त्वं हि धर्मः
पवित्रं च यशः कीर्तिर् धृतिः स्मृतिः।
कुरूणां पाण्डवानां च मान्यश् चासि पिता-
महः॥) 6. 4. 13; the Kurus and the Pāṇḍa-
vas were striving for the sovereignty of
the earth by all sorts of means 6. 10. 73;
during the battle between Arjuna and
Bhīṣma-Droṇa, huge dust arose in the sky
which looked like an excessive and fright-
fully unjust conduct of the Kurus (कुरू-
णाम् अनयस् तीव्रः समदृश्यत दारुणः)
6. 51. 21; if Dhṛtarāṣṭra had urged the
Kurus to arrest Duryodhana before the
war, he would not have faced calamity
7. 62. 6; when calamity was in store
for the Kurus, Balarāma started on a
pilgrimage (कुरूणां वैशसे) 9. 34. 18;
when Dhṛtarāṣṭra and others started for
the battlefield a big cry arose from all the
houses of the Kurus (प्रणादः संजज्ञे
सर्वेषु कुरुवेश्मसु) 11. 9. 8; according
to Gāndhārī, Kṛṣṇa neglected the Kurus
and the Pāṇḍavas, who were relatives, kill-
ing each other (ज्ञातयः कुरुपाण्डवाः)
11. 25. 40; with Kṛṣṇa as a boat, the
Pāṇḍavas were able to cross the ocean
of the Kurus (तीर्णाः स्म कुरुसागरम्)
14. 51. 7; Uttaṅka wanted to know if
Kṛṣṇa went to the seat of the Kurus and
the Pāṇḍavas (?) to strive for conciliation
(कच्चिच् छौरे त्वया गत्वा कुरुपाण्डव-
सद्म तत्); Uttaṅka wanted to curse Kṛṣṇa
since the latter failed to save Kurus and
Pāṇḍavas although he could do that; he
also blamed Kṛṣṇa for acting falsely with
the best of the Kurus since he remained
indifferent to them; he was capable of
doing (otherwise) (त्वया हि शक्तेन सता …
उपचीर्णाः कुरुश्रेष्ठा यस् त्व् एतान् समु-
पेक्षथाः) 14. 52. 22 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
14. 53. 22: मिथ्याचारेण कपटपूर्वकं
अविरोधच्छलेन विरोधं द्रढयता);
Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka chiefs were honoured
by the Kuru chiefs (कुरूद्वहाः) of
Hāstinapura 14. 70. 11; Vaiśaṃpāyana
narrated to Janamejaya in details all the
deeds of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas
(कुरूणां चरितं कृत्स्नं पाण्डवानां
च) 18. 5. 25.
D. People in general of
the Kuru country or of Hāstinapura: At
the श्राद्ध ceremony of Pāṇḍu, Bhīṣma
fed the people of the Kuru country and
also the principal Brāhmaṇas by thousands
(कुरूंश् च विप्रमुख्यांश् च भोजयित्वा
सहस्रशः) 1. 119. 2; at the birth of
Arjuna, an incorporeal voice prophesied
that he would subdue the Kurus and others
1. 114. 31; all the people of the Kuru
country prospered when the Pāṇḍavas
followed धर्म; the people became free
from blemish and were happy (व्यवर्धन्
कुरवः सर्वे हीनदोषाः सुखान्विताः) 1.
205. 4; if Dhṛtarāṣṭra could check Duryo-
dhana, all the Kuru people would be happy
2. 55. 8; Kurus, when ruled by Yudhiṣṭhira,
would not be lamented (अशोच्याः कुरवो
राजन्) 2. 65. 13; Kuru people waited on
Yudhiṣṭhira as do the servants (कुरवः
किङ्करा यथा) 4. 65. 14; Saṃjaya infor-
med Yudhiṣṭhira that the spirited Kuru
people were all well (कुरून् कुरुश्रेष्ठ
जनं च पृच्छसि।अनामयास् तात मनस्वि-
नस् ते) 5. 24. 1; Yudhiṣṭhira wished that
the Kuru and the Pāñcāla people came to-
gether with smiles and not cause injury to
each other (स्मयमानाः समायान्तु पाञ्चा-
लाः कुरुभिः सह॥अक्षतान् कुरुपाञ्चालान्
पश्येम) 5. 31. 21-22; the conflict among
the Bhāratas would mean an end of the
people and the burning up of the Kurus
(अन्तो नूनं भवितायं प्रजानाम्।नो
चेद् … कुरून् दहेत्) 5. 32. 27; the Kuru
people did not welcome war (कुरवः …
युद्धं नाभिनन्दन्ति) 5. 57. 8; Kuru
people counted among those who knew
well the eternal धर्म and they followed
it (कुरवः … धर्मं जानन्ति शाश्वतम्)
8. 30. 60-61, 75; कुरुपाञ्चालदेश्याः …
धर्मं पुराणम् उपजीवन्ति सन्तो … ) 8.
30. 62; the people of the Kuru and the
Pāñcāla country understood fully when
only a part was told to them (अर्धोक्ताः
कुरुपाञ्चालाः कृत्स्नं जानन्ति) 8. 30. 79;
according to Citrāṅgadā, the life of the
Kuru people (कुरूणां) depended on
Arjuna 14. 79. 11; the people of the Kuru-
jāṅgala and of the Kuru country had lived
together for long; they were friends of one
another and worked for mutual welfare
(भवन्तः कुरवश् चैव बहुकालं सहो-
षिताः) 15. 13. 14.
E. Kurus in the Sabhā:
1. Kurus seated in the Sabhā of the dice-
game: Duryodhana cheated Yudhiṣṭhira at
the game of dice in the presence of Bhīṣma,
Droṇa, Vidura and the other Kuru chiefs
(पश्यतां कुरुमुख्यानाम् … द्यूतेना-
वञ्चयत् तदा) 5. 71. 11-12; Draupadī was
to receive the answer to her question
directly from the Kurus (प्रत्यक्षम् अस्याः
कुरवो ब्रुवन्तु) 2. 60. 16; it was impro-
per to drag Draupadī to face the Kuru
heroes when she was रजस्वला (इदं
त्व् अनार्यं कुरुवीरमध्ये रजस्वलां
यत् परिकर्षसे माम्) 2. 60. 32; (कुरु-
संसदि) 3. 13. 54: (कुरवः) 5. 88. 50,
56; Kurus, including Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Bāhlika,
(Kṛpa), and Somadatta, were then dejected
5. 88. 51; Duḥśāsana asked Draupadī to
wait on the Kurus (कुरून् भजस्व) 2.
60. 20; Draupadī blamed the Kurus present
in the assembly as they simply watched the
transgression of the limits of the Kuru
धर्म (and did not intervene) (यत्-
राभ्यतीतां कुरुधर्मवेलां प्रेक्षन्ति
सर्वे कुरवः सभायाम्) 2. 60. 33; Drau-
padī asked the elderly Kurus in the Sabhā
to answer her question (इमे कुरवः
सभायाम्) 2. 60. 45; she bowed down to
the elders in the Kuru assembly (गुरूणां
कुरुसंसदि) 2. 62. 2; she lamented in the
Sabhā as follows: she who was not seen
before in the open had been brought to the
Kurusabhā; she whom neither wind nor the
sun saw in her house could now be seen in
the Kuru assembly; that the Kurus tolerated
all this showed that the times had changed
(मृष्यन्ते कुरवश् चेमे मन्ये कालस्य
पर्ययम्); although she was a chaste
woman she was standing in the Sabhā
(of the Kurus) 2. 62. 2-5, 7-8; Vidura felt
that what the Kurus in the assembly talked
about was sinful (पापान् मन्त्रान् कुरवो
मन्त्रयन्ति); the Kurus should quickly
recognize what was the धर्म (of the
game of dice); otherwise, the Sabhā would
be at fault; the Kurus should not deviate
from the proper course of धर्म 2. 63.
17-19; Arjuna told the Kurus to recognize
that Yudhiṣṭhira, once he had lost himself,
could not be the master of any one (ईशस्
त्व् अयं कस्य पराजितात्मा तज् जानीध्वं
कुरवः सर्व एव) 2. 63. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
blamed Duryodhana for having argued
with Draupadī in the Sabhā of the Kuru
chiefs (सभायां कुरुपुंगवानाम्) 2.
63. 25; Bhīma was angry to hear what
Karṇa said to Draupadī amidst the Kurus
2. 64. 4; Duḥśāsana asked Draupadī
to choose as her husband any one from
among the Kurus who had assembled in
the Sabhā (एते हि सर्वे कुरवः समेताः)
2. 68. 12; 7. 107. 13; in the Kuru assem-
bly, Karṇa reviled Draupadī as the wife
of the Dāsas (सभामध्ये … दासभार्येति
पाञ्चालीम् अब्रवीत् कुरुसंसदि) 8. 5. 79;
Karṇa spoke bad words to Draupadī in
the presence of the Kuru heroes in the
assembly (सभायां कुरुवीरमध्ये) 8.
46. 39; the Kurus, including Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
were dejected when Draupadī sought help
(in the Sabhā) 15. 23. 12; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
remembered what Bhīma vowed to do
within the hearing of the Kurus (कुरूणां
शृण्वतां तदा) 7. 110. 16; Duryodhana
vowed in the midst of the assembly that
the kingdom of five rivers would be of
Yudhiṣṭhira if he carried out the terms of
the second game of dice, and if the Kaura-
vas were defeated they would live out for
the same period (ब्रवीमि सत्यं कुरु-
संसदीह तवैव ता भारत पञ्च नद्यः)
3. 35. 10-11; it was not proper to act
contrary to what was agreed upon in the
midst of the Kuru heroes (कुरुवी रमध्ये)
3. 35. 18; Duḥśāsana addressed the Pāṇḍa-
vas as ‘cow, cow’ in the midst of the
Kurus (मध्ये कुरूणां … गौर् गौर् इति
स्माह्वयन् मुक्तलज्जः) 2. 68. 19; 5. 126.
10; 5. 135. 21; 9. 58. 7 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 2. 77. 19: मधुपर्के गौर् गौर्
इति त्रिर् निवेदिताया गोर् वध उत्सर्गश् च
दृष्टः।तत्सामान्यात् अन्तकरूपायातिथये
निवेदिताः।पाण्डवपशव उत्सृष्टाः।); the
Kurus in the Sabhā were fortunate that
they were not burnt down by Draupadī
(by the fire of her anger) 2. 70. 6; Nārada
cursed the Kauravas in the midst of the
Kuru assembly (सभा मध्ये कुरूणां
अग्रतः स्थितः) 2. 71. 29; Duryodhana
and Karṇa spoke harsh words to Drau-
padī in the Kuru संसद् 2. 72. 17; that
the Kurus were not killed before, tor-
mented Bhīma's heart 4. 20. 3; Arjuna
challenged Karṇa to carry out everything
of which he boasted in the midst of the
Kurus 4. 55. 3; the Kurus in the assembly
did very sinful things (कर्म पापीय एव
सभामध्ये … कुरूणां) 5. 29. 30; the
Kurus, chief among whom was Bhīṣma,
ignored the harassment of Draupadī (in
the assembly) 5. 29. 31; Duryodhana
offended Bhīma in the presence of the
Kuru chiefs (पश्यतां कुरुमुख्यानाम्)
5. 88. 82; the pieces of dice which Śakuni
threw in the Kuru assembly were, in fact,
arrows and the Kurus assembled there, as
gamblers, formed the army of Duryodhana
(कुरवः पर्यवस्थिताः।सेनां दुरोदरं
विद्धि) 7. 105. 16-17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
7. 130. 18: दुरोदरं द्यूतकारिणम्);
Duryodhana and Śakuni had invited the
wrath of the Pāṇḍavas in the Kuru संसद्
7. 126. 18; 2. Kurus in their general
Sabhā at Hāstinapura: Dhṛtarāṣṭra seated
among the Kurus (in the Sabhā) was to be
informed that the Pāṇḍavas lived happily
due to his prowess (आसीनं कुरुभिः परि-
वारितं।तवैव राजन् वीर्येण सुखं
जीवन्ति पाण्डवाः॥) 5. 31. 5; also Duryo-
dhana seated with the Kurus (in the Sabhā)
to be told not to force the Pāṇḍavas to kill
the Kurus (मध्ये कुरूणां आसीनम् …
मा वधीष्म कुरून् इति) 5. 31. 12-13; Kurus
were to hear Yudhiṣṭhira's message brought
by Saṃjaya in the Sabhā (प्रातः श्रोतारः
कुरवः सभायाम्) 5. 32. 30; Pāṇḍavas,
through Saṃjaya, greeted all the Kurus
in the order of their age 5. 46. 15; Arjuna's
message to be conveyed to Duryodhana in
the midst of the Kurus 5. 47. 3; when
Dhṛtarāṣṭra paid no heed to what Bhīṣma
and Droṇa said, all the Kurus (in the
Sabhā) lost hope of their lives 5. 48.
47; Saṃjaya was asked in the Sabhā of
the Kuru assembly who were the allies
of the Pāṇḍavas (सभायां कुरुसंसदि)
5. 49. 10; Saṃjaya addressed Dhṛtarāṣṭra
in the Sabhā of the Kurus 5. 49. 13;
Bhīṣma spoke to Duryodhana among the
Kurus (मध्ये कुरूणां) 5. 61. 14; Kṛṣṇa
agreed to go to the assembly of the Kurus
(यास्यामि कुरुसंसदम्) 5. 70. 79; Kṛṣṇa
to address Duryodhana in the midst of
the Kurus (कुरुमध्ये) 5. 78. 11; the
divine sages and the royal sages desired
to listen to the words which Kṛṣṇa would
speak to the kings among the Kurus (कुरुषु
राजमध्ये) 5. 81. 69; Kṛṣṇa joked with
the Kurus and, surrounded by them, esta-
blished contact with them (सर्वान् परिह-
सन् कुरून्।आस्ते संबन्धकं कुर्वन्
कुरुभिः परिवारितः) 5. 87. 20 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 5. 89. 20: परिहसन् नर्म कुर्वन् साम्-
बन्धिकं धनञ्जयादिसम्बन्धहेतुकं
व्यवहारम्); Kṛṣṇa had his initial contact
with the Kurus in their assembly after
his arrival at Hāstinapura (कुरुभिः कुरु-
संसदि) 5. 87. 22; Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura
that he would try for conciliation between
Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would otherwise
perish in war (कुरूणां सृञ्जयानां च
संग्रामे विनशिष्यताम्) 5. 91. 8; Kṛṣṇa
honoured by the Kurus while proceeding
to the Sabhā; he honoured them duly in
return (संपूज्यमानः कुरुभिः … यथार्-
हं प्रतिसत्कुर्वन्) 5. 92. 26; Kṛṣṇa
covered the Kurus in the Sabhā with his
lustre 5. 92. 32; Kurus honoured Kṛṣṇa

संसदि) 5. 94. 3; 5. 95. 1; Duryodhana
replied to Kṛṣṇa in the Kuru assembly
(कुरुसंसदि) 5. 125. 1; Krṣṇa's rejoinder
in the Kuru assembly 5. 126. 1; later in
the epic, Kṛṣṇa reported to Uttaṅka that
he had tried to frighten the Kurus point-
ing out the great danger they faced 14. 53.
20; Duḥśāsana spoke to Duryodhana in
the Kuru assembly (कुरुसंसदि) 5. 126.
21; according to Kṛṣṇa, all the Kuru elders
had seriously transgressed (the correct
path) (सर्वेषां कुरुवृद्धानां महान्
अयम् अतिक्रमः) 5. 126. 33; Vidura
alerted Dhṛtarāṣṭra in the Kuru assembly
(कुरुसंसदि) 5. 128. 17; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and others were witness to what transpired
in the Kuru assembly (प्रत्यक्षम् एतद्
भवतां यद् वृत्तं कुरुसंसदि) 5. 129.
30; in the presence of the Kurus (of the
Sabhā) Kṛṣṇa left to meet Kuntī 5. 129.
34; Kṛṣṇa reported to her what transpired
in the Kuru assembly 5. 130. 1; when
Kṛṣṇa left, the Kurus of the assembly
talked among themselves about the great
wonder shown by Kṛṣṇa in the Sabhā 5.
135. 25; when Kṛṣṇa proceeded from the
Kurus to the Pāṇḍavas, Vidura lamented
in the presence of Kuntī 5. 142. 1; Kṛṣṇa
reported to Yudhiṣṭhira what transpired in
the Sabhā of Kurus and also what Bhīṣma
said (मध्ये कुरूणां … सभायाम् 5.
145. 13; (यद् वृत्तम् कुरुसंसदि) 5. 148.
6, 18; Ulūka said that time had come for
Arjuna to prove his boast reported by
Saṃjaya to the Kurus 5. 157. 5; he also
reported what Duryodhana had asked him,
within the hearing of the Kuru heroes, to
convey to the Pāṇḍavas (शृण्वतां कुरुवी-
राणाम्) 5. 158. 6; 5. 160. 10; Duryodhana's
consultations with Karṇa and others in
the Kuru assembly (कर्णः संपृष्टः
कुरुसंसदि) 5. 195. 6; since the Kurus
did not agree to what Kṛṣṇa told them,
he asked the Pāṇḍavas to move out
to the battlefield with him under the
Puṣya constellation (न कुर्वन्ति वचो
मह्यं कुरवः कालचोदिताः।निर्गच्छ-
ध्वं पाण्डवेयाः पुष्येण सहिता मया॥)
9. 34. 9. 3. Kurus in their Sabhā referr-
ed to in some other context: A certain
Brāhmaṇa reviled the Āraṭṭa (Bāhlīka)
country in the assembly of the Kurus (यद्
अन्यो ऽप्य् उक्तवान् अस्मान् ब्राह्मणः कुरु-
संसदि) 8. 30. 34, 41. 4. On one
occasion, not a regular meeting of the
Sabhā, but a meeting of the heroes on
the side of the Kauravas on the battlefield
is referred to as Kuru assembly: Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to tell him the reply
of Droṇa to Duryodhana in the meeting
of the Kurus (द्रोणस् तथोक्तः कुरुसं-
सदि।किम् उक्तवान्) 7. 126. 2.
F. The
term Kuru includes, besides those on the
side of the Kauravas, also the Pāṇḍavas,
or, the term Kuru refers only to the
Pāṇḍavas: When the number of Kurus
was diminished, Uttarā gave birth to
Parikṣit (परिक्षीणेषु कुरुषु) 1. 45. 13;
 14. 66. 2; Janamejaya ruled the kingdom
which came to him in the line of the Kurus
(राज्यं कुरुकुलागतम्) 1. 45. 16; in the
line of the Kurus, no king was born who
was not attentive to his subjects and was
not dear to them 1. 45. 17; the eminent
Kurus (कुरूद्वहाः) were tired at the end
of the day of sports at Pramāṇakoṭi 1.
119. 31; since a teacher who was not quali-
fied could not teach the use of missiles to
the mighty Kurus, Bhīṣma looked for
a special teacher (नाल्पधीर् … विनयेत्
कुरून् अस्त्रे महाबलान्) 1. 121. 2; the
Kurus (i. e. the Pāṇḍavas), delighted,
greeted Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma 1. 183.
5; the eminent Kurus (कुरुपुंगवाः
i. e. the Pāṇḍavas) went to the residence
of Drupada 1. 186. 3; the eminent among
the Kurus (i. e. the Pāṇḍavas) and the
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, enjoyed their time
at Indraprastha; honoured by the Kurus
(i. e. the Pāṇḍavas) the Vṛṣṇi and the
Andhaka chiefs returned to Dvāravatī tak-
ing with them the jewels given by the best
among the Kurus (कुरुसत्तमैः i. e. by the
Pāṇḍavas) 1. 213. 53-56; according to Śiśu-
pāla, the Kurus (i. e. the Pāṇḍavas) were
clearly cheating Kṛṣṇa when they honoured
him first (त्वाम् एव कुरवो व्यक्तं प्रलम्-
भन्ते जनार्दन) 2. 34. 20 (Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 2. 37. 28; प्रलम्भन्ते
अवलम्बन्ते); Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Maitreya
whether the good-brotherliness of the Kurus
would remain undisturbed (कच्चित् कुरू-
णां सौभ्रात्रम् अव्युच्छिन्नं भविष्यति)
3. 11. 10; the Kurus (i. e. the Pāṇḍavas)
helped by Arjuna would not be afraid to
fight even with gods 3. 79. 20; Kurus (i.
e. the Pāṇḍavas) were happy to spend
in forest the approaching twelfth year (ते
द्वादशं वर्षम् अथोपयान्तं वने विहर्-
तुं कुरवः प्रतीताः) 3. 174. 20; Draupadī
and Satyabhāmā told each other stories
of Kurus and Yadus 3. 222. 2; the Kuru
warriors (कुरुपुङ्गवाः i. e. Pāṇḍavas)
followed Virāṭa who started to fight with
Suśarman 4. 30. 25; Vidura told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra that Dhārtarāṣṭras and Pāṇḍavas
should protect each other; the Kurus
should have common enemies and comm-
on friends and should hold mutual con-
sultations (एकारिमित्राः कुरवो ह्य् एकमन्-
त्राः) 5. 36. 70; Bhīma wondered whether
Duryodhana was going to act as fire,
caused by Time, for all the Kurus (includ-
ing Pāṇḍavas) (अप्ययं नः कुरूणां स्याद्
युगान्ते कालसंभृतः … कुलाङ्गारो) 5. 72.
18; Arjuna established suzerainty of the
Kurus over kings (आधिराज्यं … आहृतं
येन … कुरूणां सर्वराजसु) 5. 88. 31;
Kṛṣṇa employed the policy of concilia-
tion wishing to establish good brotherli-
ness and avoid a rift in the Kuru family;
he again employed it for the same purpose
by offering (five villages) (साम आदौ
प्रयुक्तं मे … सौभ्रात्रम् इच्छता।
अभेदात् कुरुवंशस्य) 5. 148. 7; (पुनः
सामाभिसंयुक्तं संप्रदानम् अथाब्रु-
वम्।अभेदात् कुरुवंशस्य) 5. 148. 13;
in the city Udayendu of the Kurus (i. e.
Pāṇḍavas), Sutasoma (son of Arjuna) was
born (पुरे कुरूणां उदयेन्दुनाम्नि) 7.

Dhṛtarāṣṭra urged all the Kurus to foil
their attempt (मा द्रोणम् इति पुत्रास् ते
कुरून् सर्वान् अचोदयन्) 7. 30. 6; it was
as if a game of dice between Kurus
and Pāṇḍavas with Droṇa as a stake

अवर्तत) 7. 30. 7; king Nala burnt the

exhorted Kurus, who were not expert

dratha meant calamity for the Kurus 7. 125.
9; Droṇa decided that Kurus and Sṛñjayas
would continue fighting during the night
7. 126. 38; so the Pāñcālas and Kurus conti-

from the other only by hearing the गोत्र,
family, or personal names (गोत्राणां नाम-

aloud when the Kurus were being destroy-

नेतरे वा) 7. 154. 40-42, 47; all Kurus
then pressed Karṇa to use his शक्ति against
Ghaṭotkaca, since all Kurus were being
killed 7. 154. 48-50; Ghaṭotkca killed
many Kuru warriors (कौरवान्) by assum-

weapons, routed, with their chief heroes

J. References to Kuru
women of Hāstinapura (mostly of the royal
family): Bhīṣma, Vidura, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and
all Kuru women offered water libations to
Pāṇḍu (उदकं चक्रिरे तस्य सर्वाश् च
कुरुयोषिताः) 1. 118. 27; all high-ranking
women of the Kurus (सर्वाः कुरुवरस्त्रि-
यः) were anxious to meet newly-married
Draupadī 1. 198. 23; the desires of Kuru
women would remain unfulfilled after the
death of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra (हत-
संकल्पाः … कुरुस्त्रियः) 3. 224. 8; ser-
vants of Kauravas requested help from
Pāṇḍavas lest the wives of the Kurus were
molested (परामर्शो मा भविष्यत् कुरु-
दारेषु) 3. 237. 7; Gāndhārī and all Kuru
women became unconscious hearing Saṃ-
jaya say that all except ten perished in
battle (सर्वाश् च कुरुयोषितः) 9. 1. 39;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Pāṇḍavas and Kṛṣṇa met
Kuru women (कुरुस्त्रियः समासाद्य)
and they all went to Kurukṣetra; there,
those women whose husbands were killed
(ताः स्त्रियो निहतेश्वराः) saw their dead
sons, brothers, fathers, husbands; seeing
the sight they, lamenting, fell down
from their vehicles (स्त्रियः … यानेभ्यो
विक्रोशन्त्यो निपेतिरे); that was a very piti-
able condition of Pāñcāla and Kuru women
(पाञ्चालकुरुयोषाणां कृपणं तद् अभून्
महत्); Gāndhārī showed to Kṛṣṇa
daughters-in-law who were lamenting like
कुररीस् (स्नुषा मे … प्रकीर्णकेशाः
क्रोशन्तीः कुररीर् इव माधव); they
remembered their near ones and ran to
them separately; those women from
noble families (परमाङ्गनाः), afflicted
by sorrow and grief, lamented; their faces
had dried up (मुखानि परमस्त्रीणाम्;
वक्त्राणि कुरुयोषिताम्); grieving Kuru
women described by Gāndhārī 11. 16. 10-
11, 13, 15, 18-19, 42-58; Kuru women,
took away their ornaments, upper garments,
girdles and, weeping due to excessive grief,
knowing their धर्म, gave water libations
to their relatives and friends; when they were
performing these rites, the river became
fordable and then again spread out widely
(भूषणान्य् उत्तरीयाणि वेष्टनान्य् अवमुच्य
च। … कुरुस्त्रियः।उदकं चक्रिरे सर्वा
रुदन्त्यो भृशदुःखिताः। … धर्मज्ञाः प्र-
चक्रुः सलिलक्रियाः॥) 11. 27. 2-4; all Kuru
women, Kuntī and Draupadī, mounted
different vehicles and went to Hāstinapura
led by Vidura 12. 38. 41; Kuru women
(कुरुयोषितः) held Subhadrā, grieving over
Abhimanyu's death, in their arms and
lamented 14. 60. 26; Citrāṅgadā and Ulupī
approached Draupadī, Subhadrā and other
Kuru women (याश् चान्याः कुरुयोषितः)
with modesty 14. 90. 2; knowing Kuntī's
firm resolve to retire to forest and seeing the
Pāṇḍavas return without her, Kuru women
wept loudly (कुरुस्त्रियः। … प्ररुरुदुस्
तदा॥) 15. 24. 11; wives of Kuru chiefs
followed Pāṇḍavas on foot when they too
on foot started towards the आश्रम of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra (स्त्रियश् च कुरुमुख्यानां
पद्भिर् एवान्वयुस् तदा) 15. 31. 2; Saṃ-
jaya introduced by name Draupadī and
all other Kuru women to the ascetics
in the आश्रम (सर्वान् नामाभिनामतः।
 … सर्वाश् चान्याः कुरुस्त्रियः) 15. 32. 4.

कुशद्वीप
Kuśadvīpa m.: Name of one of the
seven Dvīpas of the terrestrial world.
A. Location: They lie to the north
(apparently of the Jambudvīpa) (उत्तरेषु
तु कौरव्य द्वीपेषु) 6. 13. 1.
B. Disti-
nctive features as described by Saṃjaya
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra 6. 12. 2: (1) It has a bunch
of Kuśa grass in the middle of the country
(कुशद्वीपे कुशस्तम्बो मध्ये जनपद-
स्य ह) 6. 13. 6; (2) There are six exce-
llent mountains (पर्वतोत्तमाः) in the
Kuśadvīpa viz.: (1) Sudhāman, full of
corals and unassailable (विद्रुमैश् चितः
 … दुर्धर्षः), (2) Dyutimant, golden
(हेमपर्वतः), (3) Kumuda, (4) Puṣpa-
vant, (5) Kuśeśaya, and (6) Hari; the
distance between these mountains doubles
as one goes from one mountain to the other
(तेषाम् अन्तरविष्कम्भो द्विगुणः प्रविभा-
गशः) 6. 13. 9-11.
C. Characteristics
common to all the seven Dvīpas: (1) All
Dvīpas are progressively double the size
of the Dvīpa preceding it (as one proceeds
towards the north ?) and they are all sur-
rounded by mountains on all sides (पर-
स्परेण द्विगुणाः सर्वे द्वीपा नराधिप।
सर्वतश् च महाराज पर्वतैः परिवारि-
ताः॥) 6. 13. 3; (2) All Dvīpas receive
different kinds of jewels from Jambudvīpa
(जम्बुद्वीपात् प्रवर्तन्ते रत्नानि विविधान्य्
उत।द्वीपेषु तेषु सर्वेषु) 6. 13. 26; (3)
The state of health and the duration of life
progressively doubles in these Dvīpas owing
to ब्रह्मचर्य, truth, and self-control of
the Brāhmaṇas (विप्राणां ब्रह्मचर्येण
सत्येन च दमेन च।आरोग्यायुःप्रमा-
णाभ्यां द्विगुणं द्विगुणं ततः) 6.
13. 27; (4) In these islands there is
only one Janapada and even if in some
there are many Janapadas there is only
one धर्म in all of them (एको जनपदो
राजन् द्वीपेष्व् एतेषु भारत।उक्ता जनपदा
येषु धर्मश् चैकः प्रदृश्यते॥) 6. 13.
28; (5) Prajāpati himself, raising his
दण्ड, protects the people of these Dvīpas,
both dull and learned; he is their king,
is kind to them, their father, and their
grand-father (ईश्वरो दण्डम् उद्यम्य
स्वयम् एव प्रजापतिः।द्वीपान् एतान् महा-
राज रक्षंस् तिष्ठति नित्यदा॥स राजा
स शिवो … स पिता स पितामहः।गोपायति
नरश्रेष्ठ प्रजाः सजदपण्डिताः॥) 6.
13. 29-30; (3) People eat food received
ready for use (भोजनं चात्र कौरव्य
प्रजाः स्वयम् उपस्थितम्।सिद्धम् एव
महाराज भुञ्जते तत्र नित्यदा॥) 6. 13.
31.

च) 1. 197. 25.
B. Characteristic: Dāśā-
rhas did not try to save their life in war
(न हि … दाशार्हा रणे रक्षन्ति जीवितम्);
they did not go the way the cowards and
the unrighteous do, i. e. they did not
avoid war; during the war they remained
steadfast and did not run away from the

ग्रामे च पलायनम्।भीरूणाम् असतां
मार्गो नैष दाशार्हसेवितः॥ 7. 85. 95-96;

Pāṇḍavas, the Dāśārha people (दाशार्हाः)
would join him 1. 197. 25; (2) Nārada
took leave of Yudhiṣṭhira to go to the
town of the Dāśārha people (दाशार्ह-
नगरीं प्रति) 2. 11. 71; (3) When Pra-

Daśārha heroes (दशार्हवीराः) to return
to their country (and not march against
Kauravas) 3. 120. 28; (6) Kṛṣṇa assured
Yudhiṣṭhira that the Daśārha fighters
would carry out the latter's orders (दशा-
र्हयोधाः … निदेशं तव पालयन्ति) 3.
180. 21; he suggested that Hāstinapura with
Dāśārha army consisting of horse-riders
and foot-soldiers might wait for his return
to Hāstinapura (दाशार्हयोधैस् तु ससादि-
योधं प्रतीक्षताम् नागपुरं भवन्-

along with Kṛṣṇa and excellent Dāśārha
persons (दाशार्हप्रवरैः) 5. 7. 36; (9)
Bhīṣma and Droṇa wanted Duryodhana
to make peace with Pāṇḍavas so that all
kings headed by Dāśārha (= Kṛṣṇa ?)
might shed tears of joy (दाशार्हप्रमुखा
नृपाः) 5. 136. 17; (10) If Karṇa were
to join the Pāṇḍavas, Dāśārha people
would form part of his retinue (दाशार्हाः
परिवारास् ते) 5. 138. 23; (11) The people
of Daśārha country (दाशार्हाः) were angry

tioned among Kṛṣṇa's exploits, his victory
over Daśerakas (दशेरकान् … जितवान् पुण्ड-
रीकाक्षः) 7. 10. 16, 18.

दस्यु
Dasyu m. (pl.): Designation of a
class of people following a mode of life not
approved by the law-makers; sometimes
(especially in the Śāntiparvan) the term
designates robbers; they moved in groups,
hence sometimes referred to as दस्युगण।
A. Location: Lived in the north-east
(प्रागुत्तरां दिशं ये च वसन्त्य् आश्रित्य
दस्यवः) 2. 24. 23; lived on mountains
(दस्यून् पर्वतवासिनः) 2. 24. 15; lived
in forests (अप्य् अरण्यं समाश्रित्य चरेद्
दस्युगणैः सह) 12. 131. 10.
B. Des-
cription: Their heads shaven (लूनमूर्-
धज) 7. 95. 40; sinful (पापकर्मन्), their
minds obsessed by avarice (लोभोपहतचे-
तस्), and their sight inauspicious (अशुभ-
दर्शन) 16. 8. 45; cruel (क्रूर) 8. 49.
43; used sticks as weapons (यष्टिप्रह-
रण) 16. 8. 47.
C. Relations with other
tribes: Ocassionally referred to as Śabara
(तत्रावसत् … शबरालये) 12. 162. 34; (वासो
मे शबरालये) 12. 162. 5; Yavanas,
Kirātas, Gāndhāras, and many other tribes
led the life of Dasyus (सर्वे ते दस्युजी-
विनः) 12. 65. 13-15.
D. Their degraded
status in society revealed in many ways:
(1) By comparing men who behaved
improperly or unlawfully with Dasyus: (i)
A poor man's begging is like an attack;
he thereby annoys others like a Dasyu
(याञ्चाम् आहुर् अनीशस्य अभिहारं च
भारत।उद्वेजयति याचन् हि सदा भूतानि
दस्युवत्॥) 13. 59. 4 (Nī. on Bom.
Ed. 13. 60. 4: अनीशस्य दरिद्रस्य। but
अभिहारं तिरस्कारम्); (ii) A man of
evil conduct considered mean like a Dasyu
(दुराचारस् तु दुर्बुद्धिर् … दस्युर् इवा-
धमः) 12. 166. 9; (iii) Ignorant men
carry on their heads the burden of सं-
सार by considering the wrong direction
(as the right one) just as the Dasyus
carry on their heads the load of flesh
while following the wrong way (प्रकीर्ण-
मेषभारो हि यद्वत् धार्येत दस्युभिः।
प्रतिलोमां दिशं बुद्ध्वा संसारम्
अबुधास् तथा॥) 12. 208. 13 (Nī. Bom. Ed.
12. 215. 14 reads प्रकीर्णमेषभारं हि
and explains: आमिषभारं वहन्तश् चोराः
गम्यां दिशं राजकीयाद्यवरोधात् प्रति-
कूलां बुध्वा (?) आमिषं त्यक्त्वान्यां
दिशम् गच्छन्तो यथा न बध्यन्ते …
प्रकीर्णमेषः विशस्तमेषः आमिषम् इत्य्
अर्थः क्लीबत्वम् आर्षम् see Editors note
on Vol. 16. p. 2169 where Arjunamiśra's
reading मोष, meaning लोप्त्र ‘stolen pro-
perty’, in place of मेष is preferred); but
just as one should abandon the company of
the Dasyus going the wrong way and follow
the wholesome way, similarly one should
give up doing actions dominated by रजस्
and तमस् and gain happiness (तान् एव च
यथा दस्यून् क्षिप्त्वा गच्छेच् छिवां
दिशम्।तथा रजस्तमःकर्माण्य् उत्सृज्य
प्राप्नुयात् सुखम्) 12. 208. 14; (iv)
According to Maitreya what happened in
the सभा of the Kauravas was like imi-
tating the behaviour of Dasyus (दस्यूनाम्
इव यद् वृत्तं सभायाम्) 3. 11. 17; (v)
Draupadī told Virāṭa that his following
the धर्म of Dasyus (since he did
nothing to check Kīcaka) brought no
credit to his Sabhā (दस्यूनाम् इव
धर्मस् ते न हि संसदि शोभते) 4.
15. 24; (vi) Sātyaki's killing Bhūriśravas
in the unlawful way was choosing the
धर्म of Dasyus 7. 131. 2; (2) By referr-
ing to the unlawful and dangerous acts of
Dasyus: (i) Yavanas, Kirātas and others,
though they lived in towns, followed the
way of Dasyus (सर्वे ते दस्युजीविनः) 12.
65. 15; (ii) Māndhātṛ told Indra that
there were Dasyus living in disguise among
all Varṇas and all the Āśramas (दृश्यन्ते
मानवा लोके सर्ववर्णेषु दस्यवः।
लिङ्गान्तरे वर्तमाना आश्रमेषु चतुर्ष्व्
अपि॥) 12. 65. 23; (iii) Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Bhīṣma how should a Brāhmaṇa,
who did not want to give up his sons and
grandsons, live when the धर्म was at
its lowest ebb, when all means of sub-
sistence were under the control of Dasyus
(सर्वस्मिन् दस्युसाद्भूते पृथिव्याम् उप-
जीवने) 12. 130. 1 (दस्यु is equated with
असाधु in 12. 130. 2-3); 12. 138. 1; 12.
139. 6; (iv) Dasyus have been killing
men since old times thinking ‘they have
wealth’; they torture men inflicting on
them various punishments and always
distress them (धनम् अस्येति पुरुषं
पुरा निघ्नन्ति दस्यवः) 12. 171. 36; (v)
As good men do not take what belongs
to others, so do Dasyus not practise
non-violence; people are pleased with
Dasyus if they observe restraint (यथा
सद्भिः परादानम् अहिंसा दस्युभिस् तथा।
अनुरज्यन्ति भूतानि समर्यादेषु दस्युषु॥
12. 131. 14 (Nī., however, who reads
दस्युभिः कृता on 12. 133. 15: सद्भिर्
दस्युभिः परादानं परस्वहरणम् अपि
कृतम् अहिंसा भवति तथा वक्ष्ये इति
शेषः); (vi) Killing some one when he
is not fighting, violation of wives of others,
ungratefulness, robbing a Brāhmaṇa of
his wealth, leaving him without any posse-
ssions (निःशेषकरणं तथा), robbing
women, coersion (परिस्थानम् cf. Critical
Notes Vol. 14. p. 932), all this is practised
by Dasyus and is censurable; and even
if a Dasyu does not practise such acts,
he is all the same a Dasyu (दस्युष्व् एतद्
विगर्हितम्॥स एष एव भवति दस्युऋ
एतानि वर्जयन्) 12. 131. 15-16 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 12. 133. 16: निःशेषकरणम्
सर्वहरणम्); (vii) Death at the hands
of a Dasyu is considered wretched (प्राकृतो
वध उच्यते) and is equated with death
due to poison, hanging, or burns, or
due to getting killed by animals having
jaws 12. 286. 25 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 297.
25 seems to explain प्राकृत as दुर्म-
रण cf. योगी अत्यन्तव्याधिपीडाग्रस्तो ऽपि
दुर्मरणं नेच्छेद् इत्य् अर्थः); (viii)
Dasyus are the limit; (1) even Dasyus
do not trust in those who act merci-
lessly (दस्यवो ऽप्य् उपशङ्कन्ते निरनु-
क्रोशकारिणः) 12. 131. 11; (2) even
Dasyus trust ascetics (तापसेषु हि विश्वा-
सम् अपि कुर्वन्ति दस्यवः) 12. 87. 28;
(3) The Rākṣasas refused to eat the flesh
of the mean Gautama, and suggested that
it might be distributed among the Dasyus;
but even Dasyus did not wish to eat
the flesh of the sinful and unfaithful
Gautama, nor the beasts of prey 12. 166.
18-19, 22-23; (ix) Dasyus are equated
with impious men; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Pāṇḍu and Vidura were born, there were
no Dasyus in the Kuru land, nor other
impious men (नाभवन् दस्यवः केचिन्
नाधर्मरुचयो जनाः) 1. 102. 5; (x) If
Brāhmaṇas parted company with Kṣatri-
yas, the latter became degraded and were
as good as Dasyus (अपध्वस्ता दस्यु-
भूता भवन्ति ये ब्राह्मणाः क्षत्रियान्
संत्यजन्ति) 12. 74. 10.
E. The Duties
of Dasyus: On being questioned by
Māndhātṛ about the धर्म of Dasyus
(कथं धर्मं चरेयुस् ते 12. 65. 15),
Indra told him in details the duties of
Dasyus which included service (शुष्रूषा)
to parents, teachers, elders, ascetics and
kings, gifts to twice-born, observance of
non-violence, truth, purity, faithfulness
and other virtues 12. 65. 17-22; a Dasyu
who lived within limits did not perish
after his death; this is illustrated by
the narrative of Kāpavya; those Dasyus
who observed their धर्म achieved
perfections (अपि ते दस्यवो भूत्वा क्षि-
प्रं सिद्धिम् अवाप्नुयुः) 12. 133. 1-22.
F. Limitations of Dasyus: They are not
able to overpower a person who has no
desires and one who is free from (the fear
of) loss of wealth (न च दस्यवः।
प्रभवन्ति धनज्यानिनिर्मुक्तस्य निरा-
शिषः) 12. 170. 12.
G. King's relationship
with Dasyus: Indra created for a king
his duty and armour, weapon and bow, for
killing Dasyus (इन्द्रेणेदं दस्युवधाय
कर्म उत्पादितं वर्म शस्त्रं धनुश्
च) 5. 29. 27 (But Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 29.
30: कर्म युद्धं); Brahman created
Kṣatriyas for killing Dasyus who obstruct-
ed those that were engaged in agriculture,
cattle-care, trade, and also those who
performed the duties of Hotṛ, Adhvaryu
and Udgātṛ priests (ऊर्ध्वं चैव त्रयी
विद्या) 12. 90. 7-8 (Nī., however, on Bom.
Ed. 12. 89. 7: ऊर्ध्वं स्वर्गम्); a
Kṣatriya should always be ready to kill
Dasyus in battles 12. 60. 14; for a king,
there is no higher duty than destroying
Dasyus 12. 60. 17; their absence, (as
also of beggars), in a kingdom considered
desirable 12. 89. 20; a king should take
his subjects into confidence by drawing
their attention to the danger posed by
his enemies who collaborated with Dasyus
12. 88. 26; a king must protect all the
वर्णस् if the Dasyus tried to plunder
their wives and possessions 13. 47. 44; a
king who saved the beings from Dasyus
and gave them wealth and happiness
was a great king (दस्युभ्यः प्राणदानात्
स धनदः सुखदो विराट्) 12. 98. 8; if
a king did not protect his subjects, they
could be at the mercy of Dasyus (लोको
ऽयं दस्युसाद् भवेत्) 12. 68. 20 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 12. 68. 20: दस्युसात् चोराधी-
नाः); if due to a king's negligence his
subjects were being robbed, such a king
was Kali 12. 12. 27; Yudhiṣṭhira wanted
to know if there were boundaries beyond
which he should not allow Dasyus to
step (अस्ति स्विद् दस्युमर्यादा याम् अहं
परिवर्जये) 12. 140. 1 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 142. 1: दस्यूनाम् अकार्यकारिणाम् अपि
मर्यादा काचिद् अस्ति इतो ऽधिकं दस्यूनां न
कर्तव्यम् इति); when a king behaved dis-
regarding all restraints and in such a state
Dasyus brought about total confusion, then
if all वर्णस् took up weapons (to protect
themselves) no blemish attached to them
(उन्मर्यादे प्रवृत्ते तु दस्युभिः संकरे
कृते।सर्वे वर्णा न दुष्येयुः शस्त्र-
वन्तो … ) 12. 79. 18; if the power of Dasyus
increased (अभ्युत्थिते दस्युबले), then
even a Brāhmaṇa, Vaiśya or Śūdra should
hold the rod of punishment in hand and
protect the subjects from Dasyus; any
one, Śūdra or some one else, whom the
subjects, when tortured by Dasyus, turned
for protection should be honoured (12.
79. 34-35, 38); a king in whose dominion
hordes of Dasyus freely plundered the posse-
ssions of others, as do crows the fishes
in water, was contemptible among the
Kṣatriyas (स वै क्षत्रियपांसनः) 12.
140. 28; Dasyus overpower a kingdom
which has no ruler and which is weak (अनि-
न्द्रम् अबलं राष्ट्रं दस्यवो ऽभिभवन्ति
च) 12. 67. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 67. 2:
अनिन्द्रं अराजकं अत एवाबलम्); kings
in whose dominion Brāhmaṇas were with-
out proper means of subsistence, their oxen
and draught-animals did not prosper, the
churning pot (i. e. the curds in it) was not
churned (because the pot was empty)
when it was gifted, they became degraded
like Dasyus (नैषाम् उक्षा वर्धते नोत
वाहा न गर्गरो मथ्यते संप्रदाने।अप-
ध्वस्ता दस्युभूता भवन्ति येषां राष्ट्रे
ब्राह्मणा वृत्तिहीनाः) 12. 329. 12 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 12. 342. 19: गर्गरः दधी-
क्षुतैलादिनिपीडनयन्त्रम्।येषां राज्ञां
कृष्यादिहीनत्वात् तादृशा राजानो नष्टाश् चोराश्
च भवन्तीत्य् अर्थः; Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 68. 23: गर्गरा मन्थन्यः on the
authority of Medinī); if a king and his
Brāhmaṇa Purohita were opposed to each
other, Dasyus took the side of him who was
stronger of the two (अन्वग्बलं दस्यवस्
तद् भजन्ते) 12. 74. 8 (Nī., however, on
Bom. Ed. 12. 73. 7: अनु पश्चात् प्रकाशमा-
नं बलम् अन्वग्बलं यथा स्यात् तथा);
a king might take away the wealth of Dasyus
(and of those who did not perform sacri-
fices) 12. 134. 2; a king should always
kill Dasyus and should not pardon any
one on any account (निहन्यात् सर्वतो
दस्यून् न कामात् कस्यचित् क्षमेत्) 12. 76.
5; Dyumatsena told Satyavant that if
Dasyus were not awarded capital punish-
ment, there would be chaos everywhere;
in the Kali age, one would say: ‘this was
mine, not his’ and normal life would be
impossible (लोकयात्रा न चैव स्यात्) 12.
259. 6 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12.
267. 6: लोकयात्रा तीर्थगमनवाणिज्या-
दिव्यवहारः कलौ युगे अधर्मप्र-
धाने काले); however, a king should be
careful while giving capital punishment to
Dasyus, because when a Dasyu died, many
other innocents dependent on him, like
his wife, mother, father, son, also got
killed for no fault of theirs (राजा तस्माट्
सम्यक् प्रधारयेत्) 12. 259. 10; but, a
Dasyu, in fact, did not belong to men,
nor to gods, nor to Gandharvas, nor to
Pitṛs; for no one belonged to any one (कः
कस्येह न कश्चन) 12. 259. 21 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 12. 267. 21: दस्युवधे तद्-
भार्यादीनां वधो नास्तीत्य् अर्थः।सम्-
बन्धाभावात्); entering into an agreement
(with Dasyus) who were ignorant and of
confused mind was like trying to find a
lotus in a cemetery or godliness in a Piśāca
(i. e. trying to do what was impossible)
(पद्मं श्मशानाद् आदत्ते पिशाचाच् चापि
दैवतम्।तेषु यः समयं कुर्याद् अज्ञेषु
हतबुद्धिषु॥) 12. 259. 22 (Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 12. 267. 22: पद्मं शवालङ्-
कार(? °रम्) आदत्ते पिशाचात् पिशाचोपह-
तात्।आदत्ते चैलादिकम् इति शेषः।कीदृशं
समयं दैवतं देवताशपथादिरूपम्।;
also cf. Critical Notes to Vol. 16 (p. 2193)
on 12. 259. 22: “Lotus does not grow in
cemetery, and if it does, it is not consi-
dered as holy. Similarly one does not
expect good conduct or divine grace from
persons possessed by ghosts. Cp. (i. e. the
commentary of Paramānanda Bhaṭṭācārya)
remarks at the end as follows: तद् यथा
पद्मं स्वगुणैर् उत्कृष्टं श्मशानाद्
उपादाय कश्चिच् छिरसि कुर्याद् देवाय वा
दद्यात्, तत्राश्वसीत कः।भाविपिशाचाद्यु
पद्रवाशङ्किचेताः स्यात्-इत्य् अर्थः); a king
who, following the Śāstra, teaches Dasyus
to pay attention to place and time is
not touched by sin (देशकालप्रतीक्षे यो
दस्योर् दर्शयते नृपः।शास्त्रजां बुद्धिम्
आस्थाय नैनसा स हि युज्यते॥) 12. 25. 11
(Nī., however, who reads मर्षयते in
Bom. Ed. 12. 24. 11: मर्षयते दस्यून्
अपि न हन्ति एनसा तज्जेन पापेन); in bad
times, if a king had to take resort to a
forest and live with Dasyus he should
not associate with Dasyus who threw
all norms of behaviour to the winds;
it was easy to raise an army of Dasyus
(of good behaviour) for performing fear-
ful acts (अप्य् अरण्यं समाश्रित्य चरेद्
दस्युगणैः सह।न त्व् एवोद्धृतमर्या-
दैर् दस्युभिः सहितश् चरेत्।दस्यूनां
सुलभा सेना रौद्रकर्मसु भारत) 12.
131. 10 (but Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 133. 11:
दस्युभिः दस्युप्रायैर् अमात्यैः); when
a king considered himself more prosperous
than his (Dasyu) adversaries, he should
turn on them and strike the (horde
of) Dasyus without hesitation (यदा बहु-
विधां वृद्धिम् मन्यते प्रतिलोमतः।
तदा विवृत्य प्रहरेद् दस्यूनाम् अविचार-
यन्॥) 12. 104. 38 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12.
103. 39: प्रतिलोमतः शत्रोर् अपेक्षया
विवृत्य प्रकटीभूय दस्यूनां दस्यून्);
Dasyus should not thoroughly annihilate
even those who happened to be under their
control; they should not act in a cruel
manner thinking that they were very strong
(तस्मात् सशेषं कर्तव्यं स्वाधीनम्
अपि दस्युभिः।न बलस्थो ऽहम् अस्मीति
नृशंसानि समाचरेत्) 12. 131. 17; Dasyus,
if not forced to remain within certain
limits of behaviour, acted as robbers
(निर्मर्यादा दस्यवस् तु भवन्ति परि-
पन्थिनः) 12. 101. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
12. 100. 3: ये ऽर्थधर्मयोर् निर्मर्-
यादास् ते परिपन्थीनो नाशका भवन्ति).
H. Epic events: (1) Arjuna, in his
conquest of the north before the Rāja-
sūya, conquered Dasyus who lived on
mountains (दस्यून् पर्वतवासिनः) 2. 24.
15; he also conquered the Dasyus living
in the forest in the northeast (प्रागुत्तरां
दिशम् ये च वसन्त्य् आश्रित्य दस्यवः।
निवसन्ति वने ये च) 2. 24. 23; (2)
Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya whether the
Kauravas, if they encountered the bands
of Dasyus, remembered Arjuna 5. 23. 19;
(3) Arjuna told Saṃjaya that when he
would scatter the hordes of Dasyus gather-
ed for the battle, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and his
sons would repent 5. 47. 59; (4) On the
fourteenth day of war, Sātyaki covered
the earth with the shaven heads of Dasyus
together with their headgears 7. 95. 40; he
killed many Dasyus 7. 97. 20; (5) Kṛṣṇa
told Babhru to protect the Yādava women
so that they were not attacked by Dasyus
due to their greed for wealth (नैता हिं-
स्युर् दस्यवो वित्तलोभात्) 16. 5. 4; (6)
When Arjuna stopped at Pañcanada on his
way to Hāstinapura with Vṛṣṇi women,
Dasyus became greedy and took counsel
among themselves; then, thousands of
them, using sticks as weapons, attacked
Vṛṣṇis desirous of looting property; they
disregarded Arjuna's warning and continued
their attack; Arjuna could not check them
as he forgot his अस्त्रस्; the Vṛṣṇi warriors
could not stop Dasyus running away with
Vṛṣṇi women; Arjuna and the Vṛṣṇi
warriors killed some of the plundering
Dasyus with arrows; when Arjuna's arrows
were exhausted, he killed Dasyus with the
tip of his bow; but that was of no avail;
before his very eyes, Dasyus (म्लेच्छस्)
took away Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka women 16.
8. 44-61.
I. Past events: (1) Nahuṣa,
during his rule, had killed hordes of
Dasyus 1. 70. 26; (2) Yayāti pleased the
Dasyus by completely controlling them
(अतर्पयद् … दस्यून् संनिग्रहेण च) 1.
80. 3-4; (3) Dasyus who had stolen wealth,
when pursued by royal guards, reached the
hermitage of Māṇḍavya; they kept the loot
in the आश्रम and hid themselves due
to fear; the guards asked Māṇḍavya
which way the Dasyus had fled; when
Māṇḍavya did not reply they searched
the आश्रम and found the hidden thieves
(चोरान्); the guards reported them and
Māṇḍavya to the king; the king asked to
kill the thieves (Dasyus) and Māṇḍavya
(तं राजा सह तैश् चोरैर् अन्वशाद्
वध्यताम् इति) 1. 101. 4-11; (4) some
Dasyus were in search of men who,
afraid of the Dasyus, had entered a forest;
the Dasyus asked the ascetic Kauśika
which way the men had disappeared;
Kauśika told them that they had taken
resort to the forest; the cruel Dasyus
found them out and killed them 8. 49. 43-
45; (5) Aśvagrīva (= Hayagrīva), whose
limbs were cut off while fighting with
Dasyus, enjoyed life in heaven 12. 25. 25;
(6) In order to illustrate that a Dasyu,
who observed proper limits, did not perish
after death (यथा दस्युः समर्यादः
प्रेत्यभावे न नश्यति) is told the story
of Kāpavya; he was born of a Niṣādī by a
Kṣatriya; he obtained perfection on account
of his being a (good) Dasyu (since he
lived righteously carrying out the duties
of a Kṣatriya) (दस्युत्वात् सिद्धिम् आप्तवान्);
when the Brāhmaṇas, who had retired to
a forest, did not accept food brought to
them by Kāpavya because he was a Dasyu,
he left some of it in their homes and went
away early in the morning; many Dasyus
who behaved cruelly disregarding the rules
elected Kāpavya as their leader; they
agreed to live as instructed by him and
requested him to act as their father
and mother; he taught them the way they
should live and ended by saying that
Dasyus, if they observed the rules of
धर्म, would obtain perfection in spite
of their being Dasyus (ये पुनर् धर्म-
शास्त्रेण वर्तेरन्न् इह दस्यवः।अपि ते
दस्यवो भूत्वा क्षिप्रं सिद्धिम् अवा-
प्नुयुः॥); the Dasyus carried out the
instructions of Kāpavya and abstained
from sinful deeds; Kāpavya, who by his act
turned the Dasyus away from committing
sins, obtained great perfection (मह
तीं सिद्धिम् आप्तवान्।साधूनाम् आचरन्
क्षेमं दस्यून् पापान् निवर्तयन्॥) 12.
133. 1-24; (7) A certain Brāhmaṇa,
Gautama by name, happened to take
shelter in the house of a wealthy Dasyu
who was truthful and generous; Gautama
got from the Dasyu new garments and
wife; he lived there happily and helped the
Dasyu to maintain his family; like the
Dasyus, Gautama began to kill geese
(वक्राङ्गान्) with arrows (Nī. who reads
चक्राङ्गान् explains it as हंसान्, Bom. Ed.
12. 168. 36): the Brāhmaṇa Gautama, due
to contact with Dasyus and leading their
life, became similar to them (दस्युभिः
समताम् इयात्); many months passed while
Gautama lived happily in the settlement of
the Dasyus (दस्युग्रामे) killing many
birds (पक्षिणः); once another Brāhmaṇa
happened to arrive in that settlement of the
Dasyus (दस्युग्रामम्); in that settlement
which was full of Dasyus (ग्रामे दस्यु-
जनाकीर्णे) he searched everywhere for a
Brāhmaṇa; he entered the house where
Gautama lived; he recognized that Gautama
belonged to Madhyadeśa; he asked Gau-
tama how he came to live like a Dasyu
(मध्यदेशपरिज्ञातो दस्युभावं गतः
कथम्) 12. 162. 29-44.
J. Mytho-
logical events: Gods appointed Kṛṣṇa to
kill Dasyus (here Asura Naraka and
his Asura followers are meant by the
word Dasyu) (न्ययोजयन् दस्युवधाय
कृष्णम्) 5. 47. 74, 76.
K. Future
event: Kalki will always be engaged in
killing Dasyus; they would perish crying
pitiable words like ‘oh father, oh son’
(कल्किश् चरिष्यति महीं सदा दस्यु-
वधे रतः॥हा तात हा सुतेत्य् एवं
तास् ता वाचः सुदारुणाः।विक्रोशमानान्
सुभृशं दस्यून् नेष्यति संशयम्॥) 3.

large army of Dākṣiṇātyas stood immedia-
tely behind the army of Āvantyas close to
Droṇa; according to Sātyaki, the southern

दाक्षिणात्याश् च … एते ऽर्जुनस्य क्रुद्ध-
स्य कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम्) 7. 86. 28-29;
Sātyaki asked his charioteer to drive his

D.
Epic events: Drupada became the king of
the Uttara Pāñcāla after his father's death
1. 121. 10; (2) Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas
attacked the Pāñcālas and crushed the
capital town of Drupada (ममृदुस् तस्य
नगरं द्रुपदस्य) 1. 128. 4; (3) After
his defeat, Drupada was allowed by Droṇa
to rule over the southern Pāñcālas, with
Kāmpilya as its capital 1. 128. 12, 15;
(4) After their escape from Vāraṇāvata,
Pāṇḍavas passed through many countries,
one of them being Pāñcāla 1. 144. 2; (5)
A certain Brāhmaṇa told Pāṇḍavas about
the स्वयंवर to be held in the Pāñcāla
country 1. 153. 7; (6) When Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna arose from the sacrificial fire,
delighted Pāñcālas shouted ‘good, good’
( … प्रणेदुः पाञ्चालाः प्रहृष्टाः साधु
साध्व् इति); an invisible being in the sky
(महद् भूतम् अदृश्यं खेचरं) declar-
ed that Dhṛṣṭadyumna would remove the
fear of the Pāñcālas and bring them fame
1. 155. 39-40; (7) When Pāñcālas heard
the heavenly voice at the rise of Draupadī
from the sacrificial altar, they roared like a
horde of lions; the earth could not bear
their burden who were filled with joy
(प्रणेदुः सिंहसंघवत्।न चैतान्
हर्षसंपूर्णान् इयं सेहे वसौंधरा)
1. 155. 46; (8) Kuntī suggested to Pāṇḍavas
to go to Pāñcāla 1. 156. 6; Vyāsa too
advised them to go to the town of Pāñcālas
(Kāmpilya) for the स्वयंवर (पाञ्चाल-
नगरं … प्रविशध्वम्) 1. 157. 15; trave-
lling Brāhmaṇas advised Pāṇḍavas to do
the same 1. 175. 5; (9) Pāṇḍavas started
for the southern Pāñcālas and reached it
1. 176. 2, 5; this event is referred to
earlier in the summary narration of the
Mahābhārata in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan
1. 2. 86, and again at 1. 55. 21; (10)
The southern Pāñcālas, afraid of Jarā-
sandha, left their land and went further
south; they also fled in different directions
(दक्षिणा ये च पाञ्चालाः … तथोत्तरां
दिशम् आश्रिताः॥ … तथैव सर्वपाञ्चाला
जरासन्धभयार्दिताः॥स्वराष्ट्रं सं-
परित्यज्य विद्रुताः सर्वतोदिशम्॥) 2. 13.
26-28; (11) Bhīmasena, in his expedi-
tion to the east (ययौ प्राचीं दिशं
प्रति 2. 26. 1; also 2. 23. 9); before the
Rājasūya, won over Pāñcālas by various
means of conciliation (पाञ्चालान् विविधो-
पायैः सान्त्वयाम् आस) 2. 26. 3; this event is
referred to later in 4. 5. 19 where, however,
it is said that he defeated them in battle
(पाञ्चालान् … संग्रामे भीमसेनोऽजयत्);
Pāñcālas did not pay tribute for Rājasūya
because they had marriage-relationship
with Pāṇḍavas (वैवाहिकेन पाञ्चालाः) 2.
48. 42; (12) Vidura told Kauravas that
Pāñcālas would not forgive the torture to
Draupadī (in the Sabhā); Arjuna, prote-
cted by Pāñcālas, would invade them 2.
72. 29-30; (13) Pāñcālas meeting the
Pāṇḍavas in the forest (3. 13. 2) referred
to in the narration of the contents of the
Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 106; (14) Drau-
padī complained to Kṛṣṇa that though
Pāñcālas were alive Kauravas desired
to treat Draupadī as a Dāsī 3. 13. 56; (15)
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was afraid that later Pāñ-
cālas, protected by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the
Kaurava army 3. 48. 6; (16) Bhīma
feared that if Arjuna (who had departed
to get weapons) was dead, Pāñcālas,
Pāṇḍavas and the rest would perish 3. 49.
6; (17) Bhīma told Draupadī that Pāñcā-
las, with the support of Arjuna, would not
be afraid of even gods if they had to fight
with them 3. 79. 20; (18) Before the
अज्ञातवास, Yudhiṣṭhira asked the women
who attended on Draupadī, as also cooks
and chief cooks, to go to the Pāñcāla
country 4. 4. 4; (19) According to Drau-
padī, the affliction she had to suffer
while living as Sairandhrī meant insult
to Kurus and Pāñcālas 4. 19. 11; (20)
Karṇa told Bhīṣma that Pāṇḍavas were
claiming their share because they depen-
ded on the force of Pāñcālas and Matsyas
(राज्यम् इच्छन्ति पैतृकम्।बलम् आश्रित्य
मत्स्यानां पाञ्चालानां च) 5. 21. 11;
(21) Yudhiṣṭhira could have resorted to
war without going into exile since the
Pāñcālas were always available to him for
guidance (नित्यं पाञ्चालाः सचिवास् तवे-
मे) 5. 27. 17; (22) By avoiding war,
Yudhiṣṭhira wished Pāñcālas to meet Kurus
with a smile; he desired both of them to
remain uninjured and, well-disposed, live
in peace (अक्षतान् कुरुपाञ्चालान् पश्येम …
सर्वे सुमनसस् तात शाम्याम) 5. 31. 21-
22; (23) Saṃjaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas were waiting for
the orders of Yudhiṣṭhira (राज्ञो मुखम्
उदीक्षन्ते); they, riding chariots, greeted
him when he approached them 5. 49. 4-7;
Saṃjaya also told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcā-
las did not honour him and that they des-
pised him (नार्हन्ति पाञ्चालाश् … सर्वे
त्वाम् अवजानते) 5. 53. 17; (24) Pāñcālas
mentioned by Dhṛtarāṣṭra among those
who sided with Pāṇḍavas 5. 56. 33; (25)
Duryodhana assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
Pāñcālas would be attacked by his chariot-
fighters with arrows 5. 56. 42; he also told
him that he would soon hear Pāñcālas
defeated by him 5. 60. 25; (26) Pāñcālas
and Pāṇḍavas counted on Dhṛṣṭadyumna's
fortitude and valour 5. 56. 51; (27) Karṇa
told Duryodhana that the ब्रह्मास्त्र
he had obtained from Paraśurāma was still
with him and hence due to the favour of
the ऋषि (Paraśurāma) he would kill Pāñcā-
las and the rest in no time; that was his
responsibility (ततस् तद् अस्त्रम् मम
सावशेषं।तस्मात् समर्थो ऽस्मि ममैष
भारः॥ … तम् ऋषिप्रसादम् अवाप्य पाञ्-
चाल° … ।निहत्य) 5. 61. 4-5 (Nī., however,
on Bom. Ed. 5. 62. 4: सावशेषं मम
आयुर् अस्ति।अतो ऽन्तकालस्यानुपस्थितत्वात् तद्
अस्त्रं ममास्तीत्य् अहं समर्थो ऽस्मि);
(28) Yudhiṣṭhira, although backed by
Pāñcālas and others, chose to ask for five
villages 5. 70. 14; (29) Even when Pāñcālas
were alive, Draupadī was looked upon as
a दासी in the Sabhā of the wretched
Kauravas 5. 80. 25; (30) Kṛṣṇa told
Karṇa that the Pāñcālas and others
would consecrate him as king; Pāñcālas
would follow him in his procession 5.
138. 16-17, 23; (31) Vidura told Kuntī
that Yudhiṣṭhira was supported by Pāñ-
cālas 5. 142. 3; there was nothing more
painful to Kuntī than Pāñcālas and others
fighting with Bhāratas 5. 142. 3, 12; (32)
When Pāñcālas proceeded towards Kuru-
kṣetra, they were led by Bhīmasena 5. 149.
50; (33) Duryodhana and others were to
kill Pāñcālas in battle 5. 162. 22; Droṇa was
to burn Pāñcālas (प्रधक्ष्यति स पाञ्चा-
लान्) 5. 164. 20; Pāñcālas would run in all
directions when they encountered Karṇa 5.
165. 21; (34) Pāñcālas and Prabhadrakas
formed the army of Śikhaṇḍin 5. 168. 3;
(35) Hiraṇyavarman's friends wanted to
kill Drupada and instal another king in
the Pāñcāla country if Śikhaṇḍin proved to
be a girl 5. 191. 8; (36) Saṃjaya reported
that Bhīṣma showered arrows on Pāñcālas
6. 15. 25; on the first day of war, Bhīṣma's
chariot moved very often among Pāñcālas
and he killed them 6. 45. 4, 54; (37) On
the second day, Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to take
him to Bhīṣma since Droṇa and others,
protected by Bhīṣma, would kill Pāñcālas
6. 48. 15 (13); Pāñcālas cheered loudly
when Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off a fierce and
shining arrow discharged at him by Droṇa
6. 49. 13; Bhīma was honoured by Pāñcā-
las when he killed Kaliṅga warriors 6. 50.
110 (108); (38) On the third day,
Pāñcālas stood in the middle of the Ardha-
candravyūha of the Pāṇḍavas 6. 52. 14, 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how the
Pāñcālas fared against Bhīṣma 6. 55. 2;
seeing the river of blood made to flow by
Arjuna's sharp arrows, Pāñcālas delight-
fully raised a loud roar 6. 55. 126, (121-
125); (39) On the fourth day, the chief
warriors of Pāñcālas stood at the same
place of the same व्यूह as they did on
the previous day 6. 56. 11; when Bhīṣma
and others marched to help Bhagadatta,
Pāñcālas and others chased them; since
Bhīṣma did not like to continue fighting
with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and others he
thought of declaring the end of the war
for that day 6. 60. 64, 68; (40) On the
fifth day, although Pāñcālas were getting
killed by Bhīṣma, they rushed at him with
spirited mind (आर्यां युद्धे मतिं कृत्वा)
6. 68. 31; (41) On the sixth day, Bhīṣma
put to death the armies of Pāñcālas with
arrows the joints of which were smooth
6. 75. 57; (42) On the seventh day,
Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas (व्यध-
मत्) 6. 82. 38; (43) On the eighth day,
Bhīṣma felled down great Pāñcāla archers,
but not afraid of death (त्यक्त्वा मृत्युकृतं
भयम्), they attacked Bhīṣma; he cut off
their hands and heads and broke their
chariots; those who fought from horse-
backs also lost their heads 6. 84. 3-6;
Bhīṣma strove to kill Pāñcālas while Arjuna
fought with their adversaries to protect
them 6. 89. 9; when Bhagadatta wanted
to reach Yudhiṣṭhira, he had to fight
a fierce battle with Pāñcālas who were
prepared to fight with weapons (उद्यता-
युधैः) 6. 91. 80; on the night of
that day, Duryodhana reminded Bhīṣma
of his vow to kill Pāñcālas 6. 93. 37;
Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that he
would kill all Pāñcālas who were taking
part in the war or would get himself killed
by them 6. 94. 14-15; (44) On the ninth
day, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana that if
they protected Bhīṣma, he would kill
Pāñcālas who had made a common cause
with Pāṇḍavas (यत्तान् पाञ्चालान् पाण्डवैः
सह) 6. 101. 4; (45) On the tenth day,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, protected by Pāñcālas,
stood behind Sātyaki and Cekitāna in the
Sarvaśatrunibarhaṇavyūha of Pāṇḍavas;
Bhīṣma rushed towards them 6. 104. 4, 6,
29; Pāñcālas tried to check Bhīṣma who
was killing his opponents 6. 105. 8; Bhīṣma
dried up the lustre of the eminent and
very strong Pāñcāla princes (पाञ्चालानां
च ये श्रेष्ठा राजपुत्रा महाबलाः।तेषां
आदत्त तेजांसि) 6. 105. 31; Bhīṣma sugge-
sted to Yudhiṣṭhira, who was close to him,
that if he desired Bhīṣma to be killed,
Arjuna, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas should
jointly lead the attack on him; accor-
dingly Arjuna, along with Pāñcālas and
Cedis, and led by Śikhaṇḍin, marched
towards Bhīṣma 6. 111. 15, 26; Bhīṣma
in his battle with Matsyas and Pāñcālas,
alone, killed innumerable elephants and
horses, seven great chariot-fighters, and
in addition five thousand chariot-fighters
and fourteen thousand footsoldiers 6. 113.
21-22; when Bhīṣma killed seven great
chariot-fighters, there arose a great roar
(किलकिलाशब्दः) among Pāñcālas and
others who, riding horses, chariots, ele-
phants, and also those who fought on foot
attacked Bhīṣma 6. 113. 46-48; when Bhīṣma
fell, Pāñcālas blew conches 6. 114. 107; at
his fall in the evening of the tenth day
(सायाह्ने) Pāñcālas were delighted 6. 115.
7; (46) In the summary narration of the
events which occurred while Droṇa was
the general of the Kaurava army, it is
mentioned that the large army of Pāñcālas
was scattered by Droṇa when he agitated
it and penetrated it (संक्षोभ्यमाणा
द्रोणेन भिद्यमाना महाचमूः); they,
led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, trembled (समकम्-
पन्त) while they got killed by Droṇa
7. 6. 34, 36; whenever Pāñcālas attacked
Droṇa he killed them along with their
horses and broke their chariots; ultimately
Pāñcālas killed Droṇa by doing evil and
cruel deeds (पाञ्चालैर् अशिवैः क्रूरकर्म-
भिः।हतो रुक्मरथो राजन् कृत्वा कर्म
सुदुष्करम्॥) 7. 7. 20-21, 32; (47) On
the eleventh day, Pāñcālas attacked the
warriors led by Aśvatthāman who attacked
Draupadī's sons 7. 15. 11; at the end of
that day, they praised Arjuna when he
declared the end of the war for the day
7. 15. 50; (48) On the twelfth day, Pāñcā-
las attacked Droṇa; he scattered them
away and repeatedly defeated them 7. 20.
18-19, 23; when a Pāñcāla prince (पाञ्चा-
ल्य, not named) was killed by Droṇa,
Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill
Droṇa, kill Droṇa’; in the fierce battle,
Droṇa threw the excessively angered Pāñ-
cālas (भृशसंक्रुद्धान्) into disorder
7. 20. 46, 48-49; Pāñcālas, getting killed by
Droṇa, trembled (समकम्पन्त) 7. 20.
53; they were broken (भग्न) by Droṇa
7. 21. 1; pierced by Droṇa's arrows, they
were thrown back from their positions
(चलितान्); Duryodhana pointed out to
Karṇa Droṇa's feat and described the
plight of Pāñcālas 7. 21. 7, 11-14; Pāñcālas
gathered around Bhīma 7. 21. 23; of the
twelve thousand great warriors of Pāñcālas
six thousand followed Śikhaṇḍin 7. 22.
14; the remaining six thousand Prabha-
drakas (Pāñcālas), riding chariots, with
raised weapons and stretched bows, and
making death as their common goal
(समानमृत्यवो भूत्वा) followed Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna 7. 22. 36-37; Bhagadatta was en-
circled by Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālas; Bhaga-
datta, riding his elephant, scattered them
away; he forced them to run away 7. 25. 24,
26, 41; Pāñcālas, shouting ‘(attack) Droṇa’
(द्रोणम् द्रोणम् इति … पाञ्चालाः समचो-
दयन्) incited one other; wherever Droṇa
attacked the group of Pāñcāla chariot-
fighters, Dhṛṣṭadyumna went to their help
7. 30. 6, 8; although afflicted by Droṇa's
arrows (शरार्ताः), Pāñcālas did not give up
fighting with him; Droṇa killed many of
them 7. 31. 38-39; (49) On the thirteenth
day, Pāñcālas, checked by Droṇa's arrows
could not approach him who was protecting
Kaurava army; that was a wonderful feat
(तद् अद्भुतम् अपश्याम … ।यद् एनं
नाभ्यवर्तन्त पाञ्चालाः … ) 7. 34. 10;
Bhīma assured Abhimanyu that he, Pāñcā-
las and others would follow him when he
entered the Cakravyūha 7. 34. 22; Duḥśā-
sana told Duryodhana that he would kill
Abhimanyu in the presence of Pāṇḍavas
and Pāñcālas 7. 38. 22; when Duḥśāsana
swooned in his encounter with Abhimanyu,
Pāñcālas raised a loud roar; led by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira they then attacked Droṇa's army
7. 39. 17-18; Pāñcālas and others attacked
Jayadratha who foiled their attempt to
follow Abhimanyu 7. 42. 18; Arjuna would
have himself protected Abhimanyu if he
had known that Pāñcālas could not do
that 7. 50. 74; Subhadrā wondered who
could kill Abhimanyu as though he was
helpless when heroic Pāñcālas were there
to help him 7. 55. 9; she felt contempt for
the strength of Pāñcālas (पाञ्चालानां च
धिग् बलम्) 7. 55. 12; (50) Saṃjaya told
the grieving Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālas would (at the end of the war)
realize that the calamity was due to his fail-
ure to adopt the right course (तत् ते बुद्धि-
व्यभीचारम् उपलप्स्यन्ति … ।पाञ्चाला … )
7. 62. 7; (51) On the fourteenth day,
Pāñcālas fought a fierce battle with Kurus in
front of the व्यूह of Droṇa; Droṇa and
many other kings on the side of Kauravas
checked the onward march of Pāñcālas;
when Kaurava army was being killed by
Pāṇḍavas, Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas
with arrows 7. 70. 3, 13-14, 27; Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters saved Dhṛṣṭadyumna from
the attack of Droṇa 7. 72. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya what did the Pāñcālas do
when in their attempt to get close to Arjuna,
they were checked by Droṇa (भारद्वाजेन
संवृताः); Saṃjaya told him that in
the afternoon of that day Kurus and
Pāñcālas fought each other with Droṇa
as the bet (अपराह्णे महाराज संग्रा-
मे … ।पाञ्चालानां कुरूणां च द्रोणे
द्यूतम् अवर्तत॥); Pāñcālas, wanting
to kill Droṇa showered arrows on him;
in the fierce battle, Pāñcālas, wanting to
break the army, used important missiles
(तदनीकं बिभित्सन्तो महास्त्राणि व्यदर्-
शयन्) 7. 81. 1-5; demon Alambusa made
a river of blood flow carrying away
(dead) Pāñcālas 7. 83. 30; Droṇa killed
twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors, known as great
chariot-fighters and honoured by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna (महारथसमाख्याता धृष्ट-
द्युम्नस्य संमताः); he killed choice
Pāñcāla warriors (पाञ्चालानां … वरान्
वरान्) 7. 85. 28-29; when Droṇa defeated
hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas and
killed many of them there went up a cry (of
grief) (तेषाम् समभवच् छब्दो वध्य-
तां द्रोणसायकैः) 7. 85. 31-32; gods, Gan-
dharvas and others who were watching the
battle pointed out to one another the runn-
ing away Pāñcālas 7. 85. 33; in the absence
of Sātyaki, Yudhiṣṭhira was to be prote-
cted by Pāñcālas and others 7. 86. 45;
Pāñcālas, when they faced Kṛtavarman,
were attacked by him; hence they lost enthu-
siasm (विगतोत्साहाः); but soon, like noble
men, were ready to fight again desirous
of attaining great fame (अतिष्ठन्न् आर्य-
वद् वीराः प्रार्थयन्तो महद् यशः) 7. 88.
57-59 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 113. 67: आर्यवत्
कुलीनवत् कुलीनत्वाद् इति यावत्); when
defeated by Kṛtavarman they fled hither and
thither 7. 90. 47-48; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wanted to
know how Pāñcālas fought with Droṇa;
both were deeply inimical to each other
and Pāñcālas desired victory for Yudhi-
ṣṭhira 7. 89. 41; Droṇa, having seen that his
व्यूह was put into disorder by Pāṇḍavas
and Pāñcālas, endeavoured to put it into
order; he succeeded in pushing back
Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 7. 93. 35; brave
Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas rushed from all
sides on Droṇa to kill him 7. 97. 51; Duḥśā-
sana had formed great enmity with Pāñcā-
las 7. 98. 4; Droṇa hastened moderately to-
wards Pāñcālas (जवम् आस्थाय मध्य-
मम्) and put them to flight; announcing
his name while fighting (नाम विश्राव्य
संयुगे) he killed many of them 7. 98. 24-
26; Pāñcālas covered Droṇa from all sides
when he was checked by Vīraketu; they
showered Droṇa with fiery arrows, costly
Tomaras (तोमरैश् च महाधनैः) and
various other weapons; Droṇa broke their
arrows 7. 98. 30-32; Pāñcālas shouted that
Droṇa would surrender to their king (वशम्
एष्यति नो राज्ञः) 7. 98. 55; when the horses
of Dhṛṣṭadyumna's chariot ran in all
directions, Droṇa forced Pāñcālas to run
away; defeating them Droṇa put his व्यूह
in order (स्वं व्यूहं पुनर् आस्थाय) 7.
98. 57-58; when Duryodhana challenged
Yudhiṣṭhira, Pāñcālas rushed towards
him; Droṇa checked their advance 7.
100. 36-38; Dhṛṣṭaketu wanted to attack
Droṇa who was killing Pāñcāla army 7.
101. 23; Pāñcālas trembled (समकम्-
पन्त) as they were getting killed by
Droṇa 7. 101. 47, 53; the great fighters of
Pāñcālas were as though held at their thighs
by Droṇa (ऊरुग्राहगृहीता हि पाञ्चालानां
महारथाः) 7. 101. 49 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
7. 125. 52: ऊरुग्राहः ऊरुस्तम्भः); when
Cekitāna's charioteer was killed, Pāñcālas
were afraid; Droṇa made them run away
7. 101. 67-68; when Pāñcāla army was
reduced in number by Droṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira
did not know who could go to save them
7. 102. 3-4; when the व्यूहस् of Pāṇḍavas
were put into disorder, Pāñcālas and
Pārthas went back a long way (व्यूहेष्व्
आलोड्यमानेषु पाण्डवानां ततस् ततः।
सुदूरम् अन्वयुः पार्थाः पाञ्चालाः सह
सोमकैः॥) 7. 102. 1; when Bhīma started
to help Arjuna, Pāñcālas followed him 7.
102. 67: Droṇa wanted to remain at his
place to check the advancing Pāñcālas 7.
105. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra told Saṃjaya that if
ever Pāñcālas were to fight with Bhīma
they would not be able to protect their
lives (न भीममुखसंप्राप्तो मुच्येतेति
मतिर् मम । … न पाञ्चाला … जानन्ति
युधि संरब्धा जीवितं परिरक्षितुम्)
7. 110. 22-23; Duryodhana pointed out
to Droṇa, Śikhaṇḍin who led the Pāñcāla
army 7. 125. 11; he told Droṇa that
either he would kill Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-
vas or else get killed by them 7. 125. 25;
Droṇa felt himself sinking in the sin of
Dhṛṣṭadyumna since he had not yet killed
him, Śikhaṇḍin and Pāñcālas (मज्जन्तम्
इव चात्मानं धृष्टद्युम्नस्य किल्बिषे);
he could not take off his armour until he
had killed Pāñcālas 7. 126. 25, 32; (52)
In the fierce battle that was fought during
the night between fourteenth and fifteenth
day the reporters on the battlefield like
Saṃjaya could distinguish the Pāñcālas from
Kurus only by hearing their personal names
and the names of their respective गोत्रस्
and families (गोत्रानां नामधेयानां
कुलानां चैव तुआरिष।श्रवणाद् धि
विजानीमः पाञ्चालान् कुरुभिः सह॥);
Pāñcālas fled in all directions when
they were being killed by Duryodhana
7. 128. 2, 8, 17; at that time Pāñcālas led
by Bhīma attacked Duryodhana; when
deeply wounded, Duryodhana sat down in
his chariot, Pāñcālas felt he was dead and
delightfully they raised a loud cry 7. 128.
21, 23; when Duryodhana attacked Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, Pāñcālas advanced towards him;
Droṇa faced them 7. 128. 33; Drupada,
protected by Pāñcālas turned towards
Droṇa; six thousand Pāñcālas, led by Śikha-
ṇḍin, rushed towards Droṇa 7. 129. 8, 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya when Droṇa,
after the death of Jayadratha and Bhūriśra-
vas, attacked Pāñcālas, what did Arjuna
do ? when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army,
how was he (later) killed ? 7. 130. 3, 7;
when Droṇa used Vāyavyāstra, Pāñcālas
ran away due to fear; but when Bhīma
and Arjuna invaded the Kaurava army,
Pāñcālas followed them 7. 132. 38, 41;
Karṇa asked Duryodhana to save the
Kaurava warriors attacked on all sides by
Pāñcālas and others; Pāñcāla chariot-
fighters, feeling victorious and delighted,
were making loud sound; he assured
Duryodhana that he would kill Pāñcālas
who had come forward to fight 7. 133. 3,
4, 6, 11; the victorious Pāñcālas raised a
cry seeing Karṇa engaged in battle with
Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana asked his army to
stand still for he was going to kill the atta-
cking Pāñcālas; he also requested Aśva-
tthāman to kill Pāñcālas since they, feeling
victorious, moved in the Kaurava army
like forest-fire; Aśvatthāman was born for
killing Pāñcālas and make the world devoid
of them; that was declared by the Siddhas,
and it was bound to be true (करिष्यसि
जगत् सर्वम् अपाञ्चालं किलाच्युत।एवं
सिद्धाब्रुवन् वाचो भविष्यति च तत्
तथा।); Pāñcālas would not be able to
withstand the अस्त्रस् of Aśvatthāman 7.
134. 11, 54, 76-77, 79-81; Aśvatthāman
assured Duryodhana that he would fight
with Pāñcālas for Duryodhana's delight;
they would run away in all directions when
burnt down by his arrows; when Yudhiṣṭhira
would see Pāñcālas dead, he would be
dejected; Aśvatthāman then challenged Pāñ-
cālas to steady themselves and fight with
him; he asked their great chariot-fighters
to strike him showing their skill in the use
of अस्त्रस् (प्रहरध्वम् इतः सर्वे मम
गात्रे महारथाः।स्थिरीभूताश् च युध्य-
ध्वं दर्शयन्तो ऽस्त्रलाघवम्॥); when
addressed, Pāñcālas showered weapons
(arrows ?) on Aśvatthāman (शस्त्रवृष्टिम्
अपातयन्); Aśvatthāman repulsed the
arrows and killed ten heroes in the
presence of Pāṇḍavas and Dhṛṣtadyumna;
when Pāñcālas were getting killed, they
ran away in all directions; seeing that,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna rushed at Aśvatthāman; in
the duel that ensued, Dhṛṣṭadyumna was
covered on all sides by the entire Pāñcāla
army; Aśvatthāman, by his well-joined
arrows, forced hundreds and thousands of
Pāñcālas to flee (बाणैः संनतपर्व-
भिः); he killed a hundred Pāñcālas with
a hundred arrows (शतेन च शतं हत्वा),
and three great chariot-fighters with three
sharp arrows (त्रिभिश् च निशितैर् बाणैर्
हत्वा त्रीन् वै महारथान्); he thus killed
a large number of those Pāñcālas who
were prepared for fight (नाशयाम् आस
पाञ्चालान् भूयिष्ठं ये व्यवस्थिताः);
Pāñcālas, thus getting killed, left Aśvatthā-
man and went away with their chariots
and banners shattered; Aśvatthāman having
defeated his enemies, uttered a loud roar 7.
135. 10, 11, 13; 16-21; 36, 47, 49-52;
Droṇa used वायव्यास्त्र against Pāñcālas;
getting killed, they ran away; when Bhīma
and Arjuna attacked the left and the right
flank respectively (बीभत्सुर् दक्षिणं
पार्श्वम् उत्तरं तु वृकोदरः), great
chariot-fighters among Pāñcālas followed
them; Droṇa blew away (व्यधमत्) the
Pāṇḍava army and Pāñcālas at the start of
the night (रजनीमुखे) 7. 136. 11, 14; 7.
137. 51; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya, when
Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army and
burnt their hosts of chariots who prote-
cted him on all the four sides 7. 139. 12-14;
when Pāñcālas and Kauravas killed one
another they raised a fierce sound (आसीन्
निष्टानको घोरो निघ्नताम् इतरेतरम्) 7.
139. 32; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Pāñcālas and
others to attack Droṇa to kill him; then,
raising fearful cries they attacked him 7.
140. 2-3; when Aśvatthāman swooned
while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas
raised a loud roar 7. 141. 32; when Duryo-
dhana, while fighting with Bhīma, lost his
charioteer and horses, he was considered
dead; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa 7. 141.
60; after defeating Sahadeva, Karṇa turned
towards Pāñcālas 7. 142. 16; when Śikha-
ṇḍin was defeated by Kṛpa. Pāñcālas
covered him on all sides 7. 144. 27; they
also covered him when he attacked Droṇa
7. 145. 3; in the great battle that followed
between the two heroes, Pāñcālas also
took part 7. 145. 68; when Sātyaki and
Duryodhana were engaged in battle, there
was confused and fierce fighting between
Bhāratas and Pāñcālas (ततः समभवद्
युद्धम् आकुलम् … ।पाञ्चालानां च सर्वे-
षां भारतानां च दारुणम्॥) 7. 146. 17;
incited by Duryodhana, Droṇa fought
fiercely and started killing Pāñcālas; then
they raised a tumultuous cry; when they
were broken and shattered, dejected Kṛṣṇa
pointed out to Arjuna their plight 7. 147.
15, 22-23; he advised Arjuna to assist
their great chariot-fighters, as well as Bhīma,
to give encouragement to the entire army
(आश्वासनार्थं सर्वेषां सैन्यानाम्) 7.
147. 29; Karṇa oppressed the great chariot-
fighters among Pāñcālas (पाञ्चालानां
महारथान्।अभ्यपीडयत्); pressed hard
by Karṇa, the large Pāñcāla army ran away
(सा पीड्यमाना तु कर्णेन पाञ्चालानां
महाचमूः।संप्राद्रवत् सुसंत्रस्ता);
their warriors fell down from horses, ele-
phants and chariots; Karṇa cut off their
hands, heads and thighs; Droṇa assisted
him 7. 148. 9-19; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to
Ghaṭotkaca their plight 7. 148. 45; Pāñcālas,
smiling, watched the battle between Karṇa
and Ghaṭotkaca 7. 152. 5; Pāñcālas,
oppressed excessively by Alāyudha, had no
peace of mind (न शान्तिं लेभिरे तत्र …
भृशपीडिताः) 7. 152. 31; Karṇa forced
the Pāñcāla महारथस् to run away;
then they fought with Droṇa; they raised
a loud roar when Alāyudha was killed by
Ghaṭotkaca 7. 153. 8, 10, 33; Karṇa attack-
ed Pāñcālas led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Śikhaṇḍin 7. 154. 3-4; Saṃjaya told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that every night Duryodhana
asked Karṇa to kill next day Arjuna (or
Kṛṣṇa) with his शक्ति so that the Pāñ-
cālas could be ruled as if they were
servants (प्रेष्यवत् पाण्डुपाञ्चालान् उप-
भोक्ष्यामहे ततः)—Pāñcālas who were
like the leaves of a tree in the form of
the Pāṇḍavas (पाञ्चालाः पत्रसंज्ञिताः)
7. 157. 19-22; Dhṛtarāṣṭra was curious to
know how the Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas who,
armed and in battle-arrays (व्यूढानीकाः
प्रहारिणः) fought with Droṇa when they
attacked him (7. 158. 13); when, Yudhi-
ṣṭhira after the death of Ghaṭotkaca started
to fight with Kauravas, Pāñcālas armed
for battle (दंशिताः) beat भेरिस् and
blew conches 7. 158. 50; Droṇa vowed
that he would take off his armour only
after he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 160. 12;
towards the end of the night war, Droṇa
divided his army into two parts and,
led by Duryodhana, attacked Pāñcālas;
they were specifically afflicted by the arrows
of Droṇa; yet, although suffering from
excessive pain, Pāñcālas continued to
fight (पाञ्चालास् तु विशेषेण द्रोणसायक-
पीडिताः।समसज्जन्त राजेन्द्र समरे
भृशवेदनाः) 7. 161. 3, 28; when Droṇa
killed Virāṭa, Drupada, and other warriors
of Pāñcālas, Dhṛṣṭadyumna cursed the
Pāñcāla warriors who would let Droṇa
remain alive or turn away from him;
Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa, but they
could not even look at Droṇa although
they tried, protected as he was by Duryo-
dhana and others (यतमानापि पाञ्चाला
न शेकुः परिवीक्षितुम्) 7. 161. 35-37, 38,
40; (53) On the fifteenth day, when the
large armies of Kauravas and Pāñcālas
clashed with one another, everything
was in turmoil and nothing was quite
clear (आविग्नम् अभवत् सर्वम् … न
प्राज्ञायत किंचन); in the raised dust
it was difficult to know who were Kaura-
veyas and who Pāñcālas 7. 162. 22, 27-28;
during the duel between Karṇa and Bhīma,
Yudhiṣṭhira addressed the chief heroes of
Pāñcālas and urged them to go and help the
chief warriors of Pāṇḍavas (पाञ्चालानां
नरव्याघ्रान् … तत्र गच्छत यत्रैते
युध्यन्ते मामका रथाः); Pāñcālas, thus
urged, divided their army into four parts
(चतुर्धा वाहिनीं कृत्वा): a part hit
Droṇa with arrows; others, led by Bhīma,
covered him from another side (पाञ्चा-
लास् त्व् एकतो द्रोणम् अभ्यघ्नन् बहुभिः
शरैः।भीमसेनपुरोगाश् च एकतः पर्य-
वारयन्॥); Arjuna was urged to separate
Kurus from Droṇa; then Pāñcālas would
kill Droṇa whose protectors were slain; but
Droṇa attacked Pāñcālas and killed them;
however, they continued to attack Droṇa;
as they were getting killed a fearful sound
was raised by them; when Pāñcālas were
thus getting killed, Pāṇḍavas were afraid
and they lost hope of victory (वध्य-
मानेषु संग्रामे पाञ्चालेषु॥।पाण्डवान्
भयम् आविशत्। … नाशंसुर् विजयं तदा॥)
7. 164. 48-54, 56-58, 60-63; after the
false news of Aśvatthāman's death twenty
thousand Pāñcāla principal heroes (नर-
र्षभाः) showered arrows from all sides on
Droṇa; he then used ब्रह्मास्त्र to kill
Pāñcālas; with that missile he cut off their
heads and large arms adorned with gold
ornaments (तथैव परिघाकारान् बाहून्
कनकभूषणान्) and killed twenty thou-
sand Pāñcāla chariot-fighters (विंशति-
साहस्रान् पाञ्चालानां रथव्रजान्) 7. 164.
78-83; that day Kauravas, led by Droṇa,
had started fighting only with Pāñcālas
(पाञ्चालैर् एव केवलैः), and when Droṇa
released the ब्रह्मास्त्र, especially Pāñcālas
were killed (पाञ्चालाश् च विशेषतः। … व्यन-
शन्); when their armies were thus thrashed,
Pāñcālas, (though) angered, turned away
from battle (अमर्षवशम् आपन्नाः पाञ्चाला
विमुखाभवन्) 7. 165. 98, 100-101, 104;
Droṇa killed hosts of chariot-fighters of
Pāñcālas but was killed 8. 4. 5; (54) After
the death of Droṇa, Aśvatthāman assured
Duryodhana that he would try to kill
Pāñcālas by all sorts of means, whether
soft or harsh (सर्वोपायाइर् … कर्मणा
येन तेनेह मृदुना दारुणेन वा); only
after killing Pāñcālas he would have peace
of mind; he would force Pāñcālas to run
away by the use of Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 166.
28-29, 52; Sahadeva, in order to pacify
Sātyaki, told him that the Pāṇḍavas had
no allies other than Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and
Pāñcālas; similarly the Pāñcālas had no
allies other than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7.
169. 48, 50; when, after the death of Droṇa,
Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Pāñcālas became
ready to fight, Aśvatthāman aimed his
Nārāyaṇāstra against the Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālas; Yudhiṣṭhira, afraid of the effects
produced by the अस्त्र, asked Dhṛṣṭadyu-
mna to run away with Pāñcāla army; he
also remembered that Pāñcālas. led by
Satyajit and making effort for his victory,
were totally destroyed by Droṇa (पाञ्चालाः
सत्यजिन्मुखाः।कुर्वाणा मज्जये यत्नं
समूला विनिपातिताः) 7. 170. 10, 15, 26, 34;
Duryodhana urged Aśvatthāman to use
Nārāyaṇāstra again when Pāficālas, wishing
victory, had steadied themselves (व्यवस्थिता
हि पाञ्चालाः पुनर् एव जयैषिणः); Aśva-
tthāman told him his inability to do that
but he forced Pāñcālas to run away wound-
ing them with arrows; when Aśvatthāman
succeeded in killing many prominent
(Pāñcāla) heroes on the side of Pāṇḍavas
he blew his large conch with delight;
hearing that all Pāñcālas, and even Bhīma,
ran in all directions leaving Dhṛṣṭadyumna
behind 7. 171. 25, 45, 67; (55) Saṃjaya,
summarizing the events between the death
of Droṇa and that of Karṇa, told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra that Duryodhana assured his army
that they would be witnesses to the heroism
of Karṇa and Aśvatthāman against the
Pāñcālas; Karṇa killed and afflicted many
Pāñcālas, but was ultimately killed by
Arjuna 8. 2. 15, 18, 20; 8. 5. 30; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had once be-
fore defeated Pāñcālas and made them pay
tribute (अजैषीत् … पाञ्चालांश् च … चक्रे
बलिभृतः पुरा) 8. 5. 18-20 (reference
to Karṇa's conquests before the Vaiṣṇava
sacrifice of Duryodhana 3. 241. 29, 32; 3.
App. I. 24. 28-34); (56) On the sixteenth
day, Duryodhana requested Karṇa to lead
the Kaurava army because when Pāñcālas
would see him they would run away;
Pāṇḍavas together with Pāñcālas would be
disheartened on seeing Karṇa ready to
fight (पाण्डवा गतचेतसः … पाञ्चालैः
सह); the bards urged Karṇa to kill
Pāñcālas and bring victory to Kauravas;
they also said that Pāñcālas would not be
able to withstand Karṇa ready with his
arms 8. 6. 30-31, 40, 42; Pāñcālas and
others rushed at the Kaurava army; their
chariot-fighters, elephant-riders and impor-
tant foot-soldiers, delighted, danced and
laughed making different sounds (नाना-
विधरवैर् हृष्टा नृत्यन्ति च हसन्ति च)
8. 8. 19-20; Karṇa put to death twenty
Pāñcāla chariot-fighters along with their
horses and charioteers and felled down
their banners; he also killed many other
Pāñcālas; then Pāñcāla princes (? पाञ्चाल-
पुत्राश् च) attacked Karṇa 8. 16. 16, 22-23;
heroes from the east and south, skilled
in elephant-warfare, showered arrows,
तोमरस् and नाराचस् on Pāñcālas; Pāñcā-
las, with sharp weapons, surrounded the
elephants and showered arrows on them;
they covered Nakula to protect him from
those who were fighting from elephants;
Karṇa, after defeating Nakula, turned
towards Pāñcālas; Pāṇḍavas raised a loud
cry seeing Karṇa approach Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters (दृष्ट्वा सेनापतिं यान्तं
पाञ्चालानां रथव्रजान् 8. 17. 99); their
chariots then were carried away (by horses)
with or without the charioteers and
their axles broken; those Pāñcāla महा-
रथस् who survived began to run away;
Karṇa, showering arrows, persecuted Pāñ-
cālas whose armours and banners were
broken and tormented them with arrows 8.
17. 7, 21, 98-99, 101, 119-120; Ulūka, after
defeating Yuyutsu, turned towards Pāñcālas
striking them with arrows 8. 18. 11; when
Yudhiṣṭhira fought a duel with Duryo-
dhana, Pāñcālas attacked Kauravas making
sounds (क्ष्वेडाः किलकिलाशाब्दाः) and
striking thousands of तूर्यस्; men fought
against men, elephants against elephants,
chariots against chariot-fighters and horses
against horse-riders; those duels were for
a while pleasing to watch (द्वन्द्वान्य् आसन्
महाराज प्रेक्षणीयानि संयुगे; मुहूर्-
तम् एव तद् युद्धम् आसीन् मधुरदर्श-
नम्); all fought the battle according to the
rules; nobody struck the opponent from
behind (अन्योन्यं समरे जघ्नुर् योध-
व्रतम् अनुष्ठिताः।न हि ते समरं चक्रुः
पृष्थतो वै कथंचन॥) 8. 19. 45-49;
but later the battle was fought disregarding
the proper norms; the battle described
in 8. 19. 49 ff.; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas 8. 19.
74; (57) On the seventeenth day, Duryo-
dhana wanted Karṇa and Śalya together
to kill Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; Karṇa asked Śalya to
drive his chariot to Pāñcālas and others;
either he would kill them or they would
kill him; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa that
the banners and the chariots of Pāñcālas
were making sound (ध्वजाः कणकणा-
यन्ते … सपताका रथाश् चापि पाञ्चालानाम्)
8. 31. 51; a fierce battle broke out between
Pāñcālas and Kauravas; Duryodhana
protected Karṇa fighting with Pāñcālas and
other heroes; Karṇa rushed towards
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Pāñcālas who rushed
at him; Karṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla
warriors with equal number of arrows;
hosts of Pāñcāla chariot-fighters then
surrounded Karṇa; Karṇa killed with five
arrows five Pāñcāla prominent warriors viz.
Bhānudeva, Citrasena, Senābindu, Tapana
and Śūrasena; then there was a loud cry
of anger among the Pāñcālas (हाहाकारो
महान् आसीत् पाञ्चालानां महाहवे); but
Pāñcālas, equipped (दंशिताः), attacked
Karṇa 8. 32. 15, 20, 25-26, 33, 35-38,
43; they checked the advance of Karṇa; he
could not break through their resistance
to reach Yudhiṣṭhira; when he reached
Yudhiṣṭhira and defeated him the latter
turned back and Pāñcālas followed him 8.
33. 7, 9, 15, 41; Pāñcālas and others gathered
together and, disregarding the terrible fear
of death (त्यक्त्वा मृत्युभयं घोरम्),
attacked Aśvatthāman 8. 39. 10; Karṇa
killed Pāñcālas by thousands 8. 40. 4-5;
when he attacked them, no one of them
turned back; they attacked Karṇa from all
sides; he moved among them unafraid;
he made hosts of their chariot-fighters run
away 8. 40. 42, 44, 58-59; Karṇa, single-
handed, announcing his name (विश्राव्य
नाम) killed many Pāñcālas, respected by
brave (शूरसंमताः); onlookers like
Saṃjaya felt that no Pāñcāla warrior
would be allowed to live by Karṇa; Karṇa,
while blowing away Pāñcālas (विधमन्),
rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira; he, alone,
fought with Cedis, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas
8. 40. 62-64, 68; Pāñcālas, led by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna, followed Bhīma and returned to
battle (तम् एते ऽनु निवर्तन्ते) 8. 41. 3;
Karṇa, alone, held back Pāñcālas and
others; when Pāñcālas saw that Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna was saved by Arjuna, they, consi-
dering themselves victorious, sounded
musical instruments by thousands and
made loud roar 8. 42. 32, 54-55; Pāñcālas
quickly rallied round Yudhiṣṭhira to help
him; in the presence of Pāñcālas and
others, Karṇa broke the banner on the
chariot of Yudhiṣṭhira; he destroyed the
army of Pāṇḍavas (including Pāñcālas);
Pāñcālas started to run away; Karṇa had
already defeated them; it was felt that Karṇa
attacking them would extirpate Pāñcālas
(समुच्छेत्स्यति); but when Bhīma appear-
ed, Pāñcālas started killing Kaurava army
8. 43. 3, 22-29, 31-32, 50, 53; chariot-
fighters (रथिनः) of Kauravas, struck
by Pāñcālas, fell down from their chariots;
Pāñcālas returned towards the army of
Kauravas (धार्तराष्ट्रान्) and killed those
who, riding elephants, horses and chariots,
were fighting; supported by Bhīma, Pāñcālas
disregarded their lives and crushed their
enemies; while killing their adversaries,
they blew conches and shouted; when the
Pāñcālas were thus killing the Kaurava
army, Kṛpa, Karṇa and other heroes made
great attempt to stop their attack 8. 43.
59-65; but Pāñcālas, enraged and feeling
victorious, attacked the Kaurava army
from all sides 8. 44. 8; Karṇa assured Śalya
that he would kill all Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-
vas and then released his Bhārgavāstra
against them; Pāñcālas, afflicted by that
missile, raised a loud cry (हाहाकारो महान्
आसीत् पाञ्चालानाम् … ); getting killed by the
missile Pāñcālas were all confused (तत्र
तत्र व्यमुह्यन्त) 8. 45. 32, 37, 41; Karṇa
cut off the banner of Yudhiṣṭhira and killed
his two side-charioteers in the presence of
Pāñcālas (हतौ च पार्ष्णिसारथी) 8.
46. 12; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: all Pāñcālas,
under Arjuna's guidance, were ready to
fight; protected by him, they had killed
enemies; Bhīṣma had earlier killed Pāñcālas;
Arjuna now should kill the enemies, viz.
the five great warriors Aśvatthāman, Kṛta-
varman, Karṇa, Śalya and Kṛpa, so that
Pāñcālas might rejoice (अद्य मोदन्तु पाञ्-
चाला … ); Pāñcālas wished to rescue Pāṇḍa-
vas (पाण्डवान् उज्जिहीर्षवः) but were fleeing
as they got killed by Karṇa; they were as
good as under the control of Karṇa (विद्धि
कर्णवशं गतान्); Pāñcālas, struck by
Karṇa, raised a fierce cry (श्रूयते निनदो
घोरस् … ); when they faced Bhīṣma, they
never turned back (नासन् पराङ्मुखाः);
they would not turn back due to fear of
Karṇa; Karṇa was killing the attacking
Pāñcālas by hundreds — Pāñcālas who
gave lives for their friends; Pāñcālas were
fleeing in all directions (एते चरन्ति पाञ्चाला
दिक्षु सर्वासु) as they faced the irresisti-
ble अस्त्र of Karṇa obtained by him from
Bhārgava (8. 51. 101); if Karṇa was
neglected (उपेक्षितः कर्णो … ); he would
kill Pāñcālas and the rest 8. 51. 5-6, 12, 27,
54, 91-96, 98-100, 104, 106; Arjuna saw
Pāñcāla army running away; he desired to
pay back the debt he owed to Pāñcālas
by killing Karṇa (पाञ्चालानां च माधव।
अद्यानृण्यं गमिष्यामि) 8. 52. 5, 28; as
desired by Karṇa, Śalya drove his chariot
towards Pāñcālas; entering their army,
Śalya stopped Karṇa's chariot wherever
he desired; seeing Karṇa's chariot, the
Pāñcālas trembled (त्रस्ता आसन्); when
Karṇa killed Pāñcālas a loud cry arose
among them (तत्राक्रन्दो महान् आसीत्);
although the great Pāñcāla archers were
defeated, they returned to fight till death
(मृत्युं कृत्वा निवर्तनम्); Karṇa killed
twentyfive chariot-fighters and more than
hundred horse-riders; the wonderful
heroism of Pāñcālas was witnessed by
others when Pāñcālas did not abandon
fighting although they were getting killed
(तत्राद्भुतम् अपश्याम पाञ्चालानां
पराक्रमम्।वध्यमानापि कर्णेन
नाजहू रणमूर्धनि॥); two sons (not
named) of Karṇa killed strong Pāñcālas
8. 56. 8-11, 23, 31, 47, 49, 54, 56; but
at one stage Pāñcālas, afraid of Karṇa,
began to flee (एते द्रवन्ति पाञ्चालाः कर्णात्
त्रस्ता … ) 8. 57. 3; Karṇa rushed towards
Pāñcālas in spite of Arjuna (पश्यतः
सव्यसाचिनः); he killed Pāñcālas by releas-
ing thousands of arrows; there was fierce
battle of Karṇa with Pāñcālas who were
getting killed while fighting for the sake
of their allies (वध्यतां सूतपुत्रेण
मित्रार्थे ऽमित्रघातिनां) 8. 59. 42, 44-45;
Karṇa scattered away Pāñcāla princes
(? पाञ्चालपुत्रान्); Karṇa was making the
Pāṇḍava army devoid of Pāñcālas (अपाञ्चा-
ल्यं क्रियते); then five senior Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters, Uttamaujas and others,
attacked Karṇa but were not able to fell
down Karṇa from his chariot; all of them
were hit by Karṇa with arrows after he cut
off their bows and banners and killed their
horses and chariots; all of them were
defeated by Karṇa; when they were rescued
by Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki, the five
chariot-fighters got other chariots and, well-
armed, they rallied round Sātyaki to
protect him 8. 60. 1, 10, 15-17, 21-22, 26;
Karṇa tormented Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas
by the lustre of his missiles (प्रताप्य
 … अस्त्रतेजसा), but was thoroughly paci-
fied by the lustre of Arjuna (i. e. by
his missiles) (संशान्तः पार्थतेजसा)
8. 68. 43; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas honour-
ed Arjuna when Karṇa was killed 8. 69.
37; (58) In the evening of the seven-
teenth day Duryodhana told Śalya that
when he would be on the battle-field
Pāñcālas would give up all effort (निरुद्य-
माः) 9. 5. 24; Śalya, when chosen by
Duryodhana to lead his army, assured him
that he would kill all Pāñcālas in battle:
“let them see in battle my heroism, strength
of my arms and bow, my skill and power
of my missiles” (विक्रमं मम पश्यन्तु
धनुषश् च महद् बलम्।लाघवं
चास्त्रवीर्यं च भुजयोश् च बलं युधि॥)
9. 6. 11, 13-14; after listening to Kṛṣṇa's
advice, Yudhiṣṭhira permitted all Pāñcālas
to leave and he slept that night freed of
all care; all Pāñcālas too, delighted at
Karṇa's death, slept (happily) that night
9. 6. 38-40; (59) On the eighteenth day,
the victorious Pāñcālas went to the battle-
field 9. 7. 42; seeing Śalya's heroism, Duryo-
dhana felt Pāñcālas, Sṛṃjayas and Pāṇḍa-
vas as good as dead 9. 12. 28; having
heard Yudhiṣṭhira's vow to kill Śalya, all
Pāñcālas felt delighted; they blew conches,
beat भेरिस् and पुष्करस् by hundreds and
made loud roar in anticipation of the ful-
filment of the vow (ततः प्रहर्षः … पुनर्
आसीत् … पाञ्चालानां … प्रतिज्ञाम् तां च सं-
ग्रामे धर्मराजस्य पूरयन्) 9. 15. 27-
28; Pāñcālas and others, angered by Śalya's
killing their army, surrounded him 9. 16. 6;
when the Madra army, incited by Duryo-
dhana, entered the Pāṇḍava army, Pāñcālas
and others surrounded Yudhiṣṭhira wishing
his safety (युधिष्ठिरं परीप्सन्तः);
Madra warriors shouted: “where are the
great warriors of Pāñcālas (पाञ्चालानां
महावीर्याः) 9. 17. 8, 13; when the Kau-
rava army fled after the death of Śalya,
Pāñcālas, desirous of victory, persecuted
them; seeing the Kaurava army, oppressed
by fear, running away, Pāñcālas and
Pāṇḍavas spoke to each other about the
victory of Yudhiṣṭhira and the defeat of
Duryodhana 9. 18. 11, 13-14; seeing Śālva's
heroism, Pāñcālas raised cries of despair
(हाहाकारैर् नादयन्तः) and surrounded
his elephant 9. 19. 21; hearing the loud
roar of delighted Kauravas (सिंहनादः
प्रहृष्टानां … ), Pāñcālas were dejected;
when Kṛtavarman and Sātyaki were engaged
in a duel, Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas acted as
spectators (प्रेक्षकाः समपद्यन्त);
when Kaurava army started running away
at the defeat of Kṛtavarman, Duryodhana
attacked Pāñcālas and halted them with
arrows 9. 20. 6-7, 11, 33-34; Pāṇḍavas,
helped by Pāñcālas, stopped the advance of
Kurus and killed their seven hundred
chariot-fighters; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saha-
deva to kill Śakuni; he himself, along with
Pāñcālas, would guard the division of
chariots (रथानीकम् अहं रक्ष्ये) 9. 22.
14, 34; (60) Aśvatthāman left the army of
Pāñcāla king (पाञ्चालराजस्य तद् अनीकम्,
i. e. Pāñcālas) and went to Śakuni 9. 24.
42; (61) Aśvatthāman assured Duryo-
dhana, who had hid himself in water, that
he would that very day kill all Pāñcālas,
or else he would not remove his armour; on
learning the whereabouts of Duryodhana,
when Pāṇḍavas started towards the lake,
the delighted Pāñcālas raised a loud roar
(किलकिलाशब्दः प्रादुरासीद् … ); those
Pāñcālas who survived the war of eighteen
days followed Pāṇḍavas to the lake (पाञ्-
चालानां च ये शिष्टाः) 9. 29. 21, 46, 52:
Duryodhana even in that condition wished
to destroy the enthusiasm of Pāñcālas 9. 30.
43; Duryodhana was not afraid of either
Pāṇḍavas or Pāñcālas; with mace in his
hand he was confident to defeat them in
battle; equipped with mace, he appeared
to Pāñcālas like Indra with his वज्र or
Śiva with his शूल; Pāñcālas and other
Pāṇḍava warriors clapped each other's
palms (अन्योन्यस्य तलान् ददुः); Duryo-
dhana considered that to be his insult;
angered, he said that he would send Pāṇḍa-
vas and Pāñcālas to the abode of Yama
9. 31. 13, 30, 40-44; Pāñcālas welcomed
the decision of Bhīma to fight with Duryo-
dhana and kill him (तद् वचो भीमसेन-
स्य सर्व एवाभ्यपूजयन्) 9. 32. 27; hear-
ing Duryodhana's challenging words, they
also applauded him (संपूजयाम् आसुस्
तद् वचः) 9. 32. 50; seeing the bad omens
which occurred at the time of the down-
fall of Duryodhana, Pāñcālas were dejected
(आविग्नमनसः) 9. 57. 57; they were not
very happy when Balarāma, displeased
with the way Duryodhana was made to
lie low, left for Dvārakā (नातिप्रमनसो
ऽभवन्) 9. 59. 27; when Duryodhana
fell down, Pāñcālas, delighted (प्रहृष्ट-
मनसः), threw up their upper garments
and made roaring sounds; some expressed
their joy by stretching their bows, others
by sounding bow-strings; some blew big
conches and still others beat दुन्दुभिस्;
some made sportive gestures and laughed
(चिक्रीडुश् च तथैवान्ये जहर्षुश् च); they
said many things in praise of Bhīmasena
9. 60. 3-16; hearing that, Kṛṣṇa rebuked
them 9. 60. 17-18; hearing Kṛṣṇa's words
reassuring Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas for the
means they adopted to defeat Kauravas,
Pāñcālas were very much delighted; they
roared like herds of lions (भृशसंहृष्टा
विनेदुः सिंहसंघवत्); Aśvatthāman
assured Duryodhana that he would kill
all Pāñcālas with all sorts of means in the
very presence of Kṛṣṇa (सर्वोपायैर् हि
नेष्यामि प्रेतराजनिवेशनम्) 9. 64. 35;
(a reference to this incident in 1. 2. 180);
(62) References to what happened during
the night of the eighteenth day are found
at the beginning of the Śalyaparvan: (i)
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that during
that night the three heroes on the side of
Kauravas who survived the war (हतशिष्टास्
त्रयो रथाः) killed the entire Pāñcāla
army; that was told by Saṃjaya to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra 9. 1. 13, 30; (ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remem-
bered that Duryodhana had assured him
that he would kill all Pāñcālas; he then
asked Saṃjaya to tell him how all Pāñcā-
las, together with foot-soldiers, were killed
(पाञ्चालाश् च यथा सर्वे निहताः सपदा-
नुगाः) 9. 2. 22, 63; (63) In the night
of the eighteenth day Aśvatthāman re-
solved to kill Pāñcālas when they were
asleep; he told Kṛpa that Pāñcālas, tired
due to exertion, would sleep that night
delightfully, trustfully, feeling themselves
victorious, unyoking their horses and keep-
ing away their armours; he would storm
Pāñcālas in their camp to kill them with his
sword and then get peace of mind; he would
repay the debt he owed to his father by
killing Pāñcālas; by killing the Pāñcāla army
at night he will have done his duty and
feel happy 10. 1. 53; 10. 3. 25, 28-32, 34-
35; earlier when Bhīma had stepped on
Duryodhana's head, Pāñcālas growled,
laughed, blew conches and sounded
दुन्दुभिस् 10. 1. 58-59; Kṛpa told Aśva-
tthāman that they should kill Pāñcālas next
day in battle; Aśvatthāman was quite
capable of defeating the Pāñcāla army while
fighting with them; they would return
from the battle-field only after killing the
wretched Pāñcālas or get themselves killed
10. 4. 4, 15, 18; but Aśvatthāman was un-
able to live even for a while since he had
heard Pāñcālas saying: “Droṇa was
killed”; they deserved to be killed by him
10. 4. 25-26; Kṛpa tried to dissuade Aśva-
tthāman by telling him that it would not
be proper to kill Pāñcālas when they were
trustfully asleep 10. 5. 11; but Aśvatthā-
man asked Kṛpa why he did not blame
Pāñcālas who had committed sin by not
following धर्म and broken all norms
of life (एवम् अधार्मिकाः पापाः पाञ्चाला
भिन्नसेतवः); he had therefore decided
to kill them during their sleep 10. 5. 24-
25; Mahādeva told Aśvatthāman that he
formerly protected Pāñcālas only out of
regard for Kṛṣṇa; but now they were over-
powered by Kāla and did not deserve to live
(अभिभूतास् तु कालेन नैषाम् अद्यास्ति
जीवितम्) 10. 7. 63; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman
did what was expected of them or
whether they were killed by Pāñcālas
10. 8. 4; when Aśvatthāman came out
of the camp, Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told
him that they had killed Pāñcālas (when
they tried to escape) by thousands; Aśva-
tthāman told them that he had killed the
rest of the Pāñcālas in the camp 10. 8. 141,
150; after killing all Pāñcālas, the three
of them went to Duryodhana; they told
him that all Pāñcālas were killed by them
10. 9. 1, 9, 49; the killing of Pāñcālas
referred to earlier by Dhṛtarāṣṭra as a
disgusting and disgraceful act of Aśva-
tthāman and others 1. 1. 153; 1. 2. 181;
Kṛṣṇa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira by telling
him that Pāñcālas and their companions
(पाञ्चालाश् च सहानुगाः) were killed by
Mahādeva (and not by Aśvatthāman) 10.
18. 26; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was on his way
to the battlefield, Aśvatthāman and others
told him and Gāndhārī that they had
killed Pāñcālas and others 11. 10. 12; (64)
When Yudhiṣṭhira started to meet Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Pāñcāla women present there,
followed him (सह पाञ्चालयोषिद्भिर् यास्
तत्रासन् समागताः) 11. 11. 4; (65)
When Pāñcāla and Kuru women saw their
husbands and relatives lying dead on the
battlefield they fell down from their
chariots; tired and helpless they were
almost deprived of their consciousness
(श्रान्तानां चाप्य् अनाथानां नासीत् काचन
चेतना) 11. 16. 13-15; Gāndhārī told Kṛṣṇa
that looking at the destruction of Kurus
and Pāñcālas, she burnt with grief 11. 16.
25; she asked him how was young Abhi-
manyu killed by many in the presence of
Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 11. 20. 18; (66)
Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that he was much
more grieved to learn the truth about
Karṇa's birth than by the death of Pāñcālas
and others (ततः शतगुणं दुःखम्)
11. 27. 18-19; (67) Yudhiṣṭhira, repent-
ing after the war, said that Pāñcālas and
Kurus were no doubt killed; but those
of them who were not killed would, after
death, go to the lowest regions on account
of their (i. e. of both Pāñcālas and
Kurus) acts 12. 7. 20; Yudhiṣṭhira while
taking leave of Kuntī said that Pāñcālas
(i. e. their males) were very much depleted,
only their daughters remained (पञ्चालाः
सुभृशं क्षीणाः कन्यामात्रावशेषिताः); he
did not know who would establish their
line again, since most of them were redu-
ced to ashes by Droṇa and those who
survived were killed by Aśvatthāman at
night 15. 44. 32-33.

as an adj. (fem. -ई) mostly to refer to the
lineage or the army of the Kauravas, occa-
sionally used also to refer to their narrative
and town.
A. Origin: The family was named
Bhārata after Bharata; his descendants as
well as those who preceded him (?) were
known as Bhāratas; the fame of Bhāratas
was due to Bharata (भरताद् भाराती
कीर्तिर् येनेदं भारतं कुलम्।अपरे ये
च पूर्वे च भारता इति विश्रुताः) 1. 69. 49;

teacher Vyāsa was eager to narrate the
narrative of Bhāratas to Janamejaya, who
was a worthy person to listen to it (श्रोतुं
पात्रं च राजंस् त्वं प्राप्येमां भार-
तीं कथाम्।गुरोर् वक्तुं परिस्पन्दो
मुदा प्रोत्साहतीव माम्॥) 1. 55. 3; it
was told in the सर्पसत्र of king Jana-
mejaya (कथेयम् … भारतानाम्) 1. 2.
74; one who listened to the narration of
the birth of Bhāratas has no fear from
diseases, least of all of the next world; it
was holy, brought wealth, fame, long life
and heaven; it is also large and leads to
bliss (भारतानां महज् जन्म शृण्वताम्
 … ।नास्ति व्याधिभयं तेषां परलोक-
भयं कुतः॥धन्यं यशस्यम् आयु-
ष्यं स्वर्ग्यं पुण्यं तथैवच) 1. 56.

च पुण्यं स्वस्त्ययनं महत्।धन्यं
यशस्यम् आयुष्यं कीर्तयिष्यामि ते ऽन-

not give Pāṇḍavas their share, that would
bring calamity to Bharatas (भरतानाम्
अभूतये) 3. 30. 48; (17) Yudhiṣṭhira re-
minded Bhīma what Duryodhana had stipu-
lated for his single bait in the presence
of all Bharatas (एकग्लहार्थं भरता-
नां समक्षम्); he had said that if the
Pāṇḍavas were found out by the spies of

spend another twelve years in the forest
(अवभोत्स्यन्ते भारतानां चराः स्म) 3.

would address words to be honoured by
Bhāratas (Kauravas and others on their
side) (ईरयन्तं भारतीं भारतानां
अभ्यर्चनीयां … ) 5. 69. 2 (Nī., however,

ving complete well-being and health for
Bhāratas (Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas) (चर
स्वस्त्ययनं कृत्स्नं भारतानाम् अनाम-
यम्) 5. 123. 25; Kṛṣṇa requested Bhāratas

rāṣṭra the great war of the Bhāratas
(Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas) 6. 16. 10; (39)
On the fourth day, Bhīṣma led the army
of the Bhāratas (भारतानाम् अनीकिनीनां
प्रमुखे) 6. 56. 1; (40) Abhimanyu
tormented the large army of Bhāratas
(भारती सा महाचमूः) 6. 96. 18; (41)
On the tenth day, bad omens occurred for
the army of Bhāratas (Kauravas) 6. 108. 6;
according to Droṇa, the wrath of Yudhi-
ṣṭhira was burning Bhāratas (Kauravas) 6.
108. 32; after Bhīṣma's fall, he was praised
by the ancient forefathers of Bharatas
(पितरश् चैव प्रशशंसुर् … ।भरतानां
च ये पूर्वे) 6. 114. 111; with the fall of
Bhīṣma, the army of the Bhāratas (Kaura-
vas) (भारती … सेना) was like a boat in
a big ocean, shaken by wind in all dire-
ctions and shattered 7. 1. 27-28; hearing
Bhīṣma's fall Dhṛtarāṣṭra swooned,
surrounded and touched by Bharata women
(भरतस्त्रियः परिवव्रुर् महाराजम्
अस्पृशंश् चैव पाणिभिः) 7. 9. 3; (42) On
the eleventh day, the eminent Bharatas (on
both sides) took their arms and started
for the war (निर्ययुर् भरतश्रेष्ठाः
शश्त्राण्य् आदाय सर्वशः) 7. 1. 21; (43)
Arjuna wielded in war the same bow
against Kṣatriyas (Kauravas) which once
before proved beneficial for Bharatas
(Kauravas) fleeing in their fight (with
Gandharvas cf. 3. 230 ff.) (यत् तद् अनाम-
यज् जिष्णुर् भरतानाम् अपायिनाम्।धनुः
क्षेमकरं संख्ये … ।तद् एव … क्षत्र-
विनाशाय धनुर् आयच्छद् अर्जुनः॥)
7. 27. 15-16; (44) On the thirteenth
day, Abhimanyu attacked the army of
Bhāratas (Kauravas) (अभ्यपतत् सेनां
भारतीम्) 7. 40. 11; Abhimanyu, lying
on the ground, was like the sun that
had set after tormenting the army of
Bhāratas (तप्त्वा भारतवाहिनीम्) 7. 48.
16; (45) On the fourteenth day, Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra remembered that he had told Duryo-
dhana that Pāṇḍavas would do what was
in his interest if Bhīṣma and other elderly
magnanimous Bharatas spoke to them
on his behalf (भीष्मस्य च महात्मनः।
 … अन्येषां चैव वृद्धानां भरतानां
महात्मनाम्) 7. 61. 33-34; Arjuna saw
many omens when the Bharatas (Kauravas),
desirous of fighting, were slowly getting
ready for the battle (अभिहारयत्सु शन-
कैर् भरतेषु युयुत्सुषु) 7. 64. 3 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 7. 88. 3: अभिहारयत्सु
सन्नह्यमानेषु अभियुज्यमानेषु वा
प्रहरत्स्व् इति केचित्); Arjuna attacked
the army of Bhāratas (Kauravas) killing
their eminent warriors (अभ्यगाद् भार-
तीं सेनाम्) 7. 68. 26, (प्राविशद्) 56;
the army of the Bhāratas was getting torn
to pieces (दीर्यमाणां च भारतीम्) 7.
85. 70; Arjuna had entered the army of
Bhāratas (प्रविष्टस् तात भारतीम्) 7. 85.
80, 82; the army of Bhāratas was reduced
to a miserable condition (शोच्येयं भारती
सेना) 7. 98. 8; Sātyaki had entered the
army of Bhāratas (भारतीं सेनाम्) 7. 102.
16; (भारतीम् चमूम्) 7. 102. 34; the
army of Bhāratas was besieged from be-
hind and in front (सा पुरस्ताच् च पश्चाच्
च गृहीता भारती चमूः) 7. 105. 12;
Bhīma discharged arrows towards Bhārata
warriors (sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra 7. 112. 28)
who cut them asunder 7. 112. 26; Sātyaki
was in the midst of the army of Bhāratas
(here, the army of the Trigartas cf. 7. 116.
2) (भारतीमध्यम्); this army is descri-
bed as full of the sound made by palms of
hands and equipped with swords, शक्तिस्
and maces (तलघोषसमाकुल, असिशक्ति-
गदापूर्ण) 7. 116. 5; Sātyaki had entered
the army of Bhāratas (भारतीं सेनाम्)
after Arjuna had fought with Bhārata
heroes of great prowess (योधितश् च महा-
वीर्यैः सर्वैर् भारत भारतत्ः) 7. 117.
43; Droṇa took it for granted that with
the fall of Bhīṣma the army of the Bhāratas
was as good as perished (तदैवाज्ञासिषम्
अहं नेयम् अस्तीति भारती) 7. 126. 8 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 7. 126. 8: इयं सेना नास्तित्य् अस्य
नष्टेत्य् अर्थः); (46) Night war: During
the night, the army of Bhāratas (भारती
सेना) adorned with jewels and gold and
with ornaments like अङ्गदस्, ear-orna-
ments, निष्कस् and weapons shone like the
sky full of नक्षत्रस् (द्यौर् त्वासीत् सन-
क्षत्रा) 7. 129. 24, 27; the army of Bhāratas
(भारती सेना) was getting killed by
Arjuna 7. 132. 42; 7. 136. 16; when the
Bhārata warriors (on the side of Kauravas)
were in a difficult situation no one could
offer them protection (मज्जतां भारतास्
नां न स्म द्वीपस् तत्र कश्चिद् बभूव)
7. 154. 41; Duryodhana proposed to divide
the army of Bhāratas (on his side) and
kill Arjuna (द्वैधीकृत्याद्य भारतीम्) 7.
160. 22; (47) On the sixteenth day,
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna the terrible
destruction of the Bharatas (on both sides)
that had taken place (महारौद्रो वर्तते
भरतक्षयः) 8. 14. 27; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
remembered that Arjuna had once prote-
cted Bharatas (Kauravas) (reference to
the fight with Gandharvas 3. 230. ff.) (एको
ऽभ्यरक्षद् भरतान्) 8. 22. 4; (48) On
the seventeenth day, the army of Bhāratas
(Kauravas 8. 43. 54) running away when
attacked by Bhīma's arrows appeared
pitiable (भारती सेना … कृपणदर्शना)
8. 43. 55; Arjuna boasted that he laid low
the army of Bhāratas (on the side of Kaura-
vas) which shone like the army of gods
(भारतीचमु … देवचमूप्रकाशा) 8. 49.
97; when the important heroes and other
warriors as well as horses and elephants in
the army of the Bhāratas (army of Kaura-
vas) were killed in battle it looked like the
sky devoid of the sun, the moon and the
नक्षत्रस् (हीना सूर्येन्दुनक्षत्रैर् द्यौर्
इवाभाति भारती॥ … सेनेयम्) 8. 51. 48-49;
the army of Bhāratas (भारती), along with
that of the Saṃśaptakas, led by Duḥśā-
sana attacked Bhīma 8. 53. 9; the army of
Bhāratas, afraid, was scattered by Bhīma
in all directions (बलं … भारतानां …
भीतं दिशो ऽकीर्यत भीमनुन्नम्) 8. 54.
9; Bhīma showed to his charioteer the
army of Bhāratas running away because
it was covered by the arrows of Arjuna
(भारतीं दीर्यमाणां … सैन्यं ह्य् एतच्
छादयत्य् आशु बाणैः) 8. 54. 21; (49) On
the eighteenth day, Arjuna, after the death
of Śalya, killed Śuśarman, his sons and
followers, and then turned towards the
remaining army of Bhāratas (अभ्यगाद्
भारतीं सेनां हतशेषाम्) 9. 26. 46;
(50) It was proper for Yuyutsu to return
to Kauravas after the destruction of Bhara-
tas (on Kaurava's side) (भरतक्षये) 9.
28. 91; (51) At the end of the war,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to narrate to
him how the Bharatas (on both sides 9. 3.
1) were completely destroyed (भरतानां
महाक्षयम्) 9. 2. 62; (52) Scenes on the
battlefield: Some of the women of Bharatas
(Kauravas) stumbled, and some fell
on the ground after visiting the battlefield
(भरतस्त्रियः (कुरुस्त्रियः 11. 16. 10) ।
शरीरेष्व् अस्खलन्न् अन्या न्यपतंश् चापरा
भुवि) 11. 16. 14; some of them (भरत-
योषितः) were not able to recognize their
husbands whose bodies were mutilated 11.
16. 53; (pitiable condition of the widows
described by Gāndhārī 11. 16. 42-58);
according to Somadatta's wife her husband
was fortunate in that he was not alive to
witness the terrible destruction of Bharatas
(दारुणं भरतक्षयम्) 11. 24. 4; Gān-
dhārī cursed Kṛṣṇa saying that Yādava
women, with their husbands and relatives
killed, would fall on the ground like the
Bharata women (यथैते भरतस्त्रियः)
11. 25. 42; (53) Bhagavān had told his
son Apāntaratamas (Vyāsa 12. 337. 38, 43)
that when Tiṣya (i. e. Kaliyuga) would
arrive Kurus, called Bhāratas, would be-
come famous kings, but there would be
family feud resulting in mutual destruction
(पुनस् तिष्ये च संप्राप्ते कुरवो नाम
भारताः। … तेषां त्वत्तः प्रसूतानां
कुलभेदो भविष्यति।परस्परविनाशार्-
थम्) 12. 337. 42-43; (54) Bhīṣma, be-
fore abandoning his body, saw all Bhāratas
(Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas) standing around
him 13. 153. 24; after Bhīṣma's cremation,
eminent Kurus, followed by Bharata women
(अनुगम्यमाना … भरतस्त्रीभिर्) went to
Bhāgīrathī 13. 154. 16; (55) Arjuna and
Kṛṣṇa saw Subhadrā and all other Bharata
women surrounding Gāndhārī (सर्वा
भरतानां स्त्रियस् तथा … स्थिताः सर्वा
गान्धारीं परिवार्य वै) 14. 51. 27; (56)
Uttaṅka asked Kṛṣṇa whether he (Kṛṣṇa)
did what Uttaṅka had expected him to do
in respect of Bharatas (Kauravas and
Pāṇḍavas) (या मे संभावना तात त्वयि
नित्यम् अवर्तत।अपि सा सफला कृष्ण कृता
ते भरतान् प्रति) 14. 52. 14; (57) Kuntī
and all Bharata women cried in grief when
they saw Uttarā fallen on the ground
(सर्वाश् च भरतस्त्रियः) 14. 68. 2; when
Parikṣit was brought back to life, Bharata
women were delighted and asked Brāhma-
ṇas to recite स्वस्तिमन्त्रस् for the benefit
of Parikṣit (भरतस्त्रियः।ब्राह्मणान्
वाचयाम् आसुः) 14. 69. 4 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
14. 70. 5: वाचयाम् आसुः स्वस्तीति शेषः);
(स्त्रियो भरतसिंहानाम्) 14. 69. 5; (58)
The best of the Bharatas (भरतसत्तमाः
i. e. Pāṇḍavas) on their ‘great journey’
made a प्रदक्षिणा of the earth 17. 1. 44.
F. Past events: (1) When Saṃvaraṇa
was the ruler of the Bhāratas, the land was
oppressed by many calamities; a certain
king of the Pāñcālas (not named) attacked
the Bhāratas; Saṃvaraṇa fled with his
wife and others from his country; the
Bhāratas lived for a long time in an inacce-
ssible place near a mountain in a country
near the river Sindhu; Vasiṣṭha then visited
the Bharatas; all Bhāratas welcomed him
with a respectful guest offering and told him
their condition; Saṃvaraṇa chose Vasiṣṭha,
who had lived with them for eight years,
to act as their पुरोहित; he said ‘yes’ to
Bhāratas; Saṃvaraṇa again occupied the
town which was formerly held by Bharatas
(अभ्यघ्नन् भारतांश् चैव सपत्नानां

G. भारत as
adj.: Besides its adjectival use in conne-
ction with वंश (m.) or कुल (nt.), and
सेना or चमू (f.) (for which see above
B and E), भारत is also occasionally used
in connection with समिति, श्री or कीर्ति (all
f.) and पुर (nt.): (1) Gathering
(समिति): The brilliant gathering of Bhāra-
tas (both Kauravas and Pāṇḍavas) around
Bhīṣma lying on the bed of arrows shone
like the sun in the sky (शुशुभे भारती
दीप्ता दिवी वादित्यमण्डलम्) 6. 116. 7; (2)
Glory (श्री) or fame (कीर्ति): (i) Bhīṣma
appealed to Duryodhana not to destroy the
glory of Bhāratas shining brightly among
all kings (इमां श्रियं प्रज्वलितां भार-
तीं सर्वराजसु) 5. 123. 5; (ii) The fame
of Bhāratas had its origin in Bharata
(भरताद् भारती कीर्तिर् … ) 1. 69. 49; (3)
Town (pura) i. e. Indraprastha: Described
as the best town (पुरोत्तमं … भारतं
पुरम्) 2. 30. 14-15.
H. Several persons
referred to simply as belonging to the
Bhāratas or as tiger or bull among the
Bhā̆ratas, best or chief of them, rarely as
an outcaste among the Bhāratas: A. Born

17.
C. History of Bhṛgus: The detailed
lineage of Bhṛgu described by Sūta to
Śaunaka in the Paulomaparvan (cf. 1. 2.
34) since Śaunaka desired to hear it (1.
5. 3) (पौलोमे भृगुवंशस्य विस्तारः
परिकीर्तितः) 1. 2. 72 (i. e. अध्यायस् 1. 5-
12); 1. 5. 6; 1. 53. 27-28;
D. Epic events;
(1) Sages of different families among whom
are mentioned Bhṛgus, Aṅgirases and others,
protected by Yudhiṣṭhira, observed व्रतस्
(धृतव्रताः) and followed their धर्म
in the Dvaitavana (चरन्ति धर्मं … )
3. 27. 7-8; (2) Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases are
mentioned among the ascetics (तापसान्)
who were honoured by Yudhiṣṭhira on
the Mahendra mountain 3. 115. 2; (3)
Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases mentioned among
those sages who appeared on the battle-
field to blame Droṇa since he fought
against धर्म; they told him it was time
for him to abandon life (अधर्मतः
कृतं युद्धं समयो निधनस्य ते) 7.
164. 88-89.
E. Past events: (1) Bhṛgus
acted as priests in the sacrifices of Kṛtavīrya
(also cf. 13. 56. 2); he gave them corn
and wealth at the end of Soma sacrifices
(धान्येन च धनेन च); after the death
of Kṛtavīrya, his kinsmen, when in need
of money, asked eminent Bhṛgus to give it
since they knew Bhṛgus had wealth; some
Bhṛgus, afraid of Kṣatriyas, parted with
their wealth, but others hid it underground;
when one of the kings was digging the
ground he, by chance, found wealth in the
house of a Bhṛgu; the assembled Kṣatriyas,
due to anger, disregarded the supplications
of the Bhṛgus and killed them all with
sharp arrows; they killed even children,
yet unborn (आ गर्भाद् अनुकृन्तन्तश् … )
(also cf. 13. 56. 3); when Bhṛgus were thus
being extirpated their wives took shelter
in mountain Himavant; one of them held
her embryo in her thigh for the conti-
nuation of the line of her husband (तासाम्
अन्यतमा गर्भं भयाद् दाधार तैज-
सम्।ऊरुणैकेन वामोरूर् भर्तुर् कुल-
विवृद्धये॥); when the embryo came out
breaking the thigh he deprived the Kṣatrī-
yas of their eyesight; the Kṣatriyas begged
pardon of the Bhṛgu wife 1. 169. 11-22;
the Bhṛgupatnī told the Kṣatriyas that she
had not deprived them of their eyesight;
that was done by the angry Bhārgava
(Aurva); since the Kṣatriyas started killing
even the unborn Bhṛgus she had held her
embryo in the thigh for a hundred years;
in order to do a favour to the Bhṛgu line-
age, the entire Veda along with the six
Vedāṅgas entered her child even when he
was unborn; the child angered by the death
of his ancestors (Bhṛgus) at the hands of
Kṣatriyas had deprived them of their
eyesight and wished to kill them 1. 170.
1-5; Aurva told the Kṣatriyas born in
the lineage of Kṛtavīrya that while he
was in the thigh of his mother he had
heard the cry of his mothers (आरावं
मातृवर्गस्य भृगूणां) due to the
killings of Kṣatriya; he was angered
because the wretched Kṣatriyas killed
Bhṛgus not sparing even those unborn;
when nobody offered shelter to the wives
of Bhṛgus due to fear, one of them had
concealed him in her thigh (1. 171. 5, 6, 8);
Aurva practised severe penance to take
revenge of the Bhṛgus who were killed
by destroying the worlds; he thought he
would delight the dead Bhṛgus (इच्छन्न्
अपचितिं कर्तुं भृगूणां भृगुसत्तमः
1. 170. 11; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 1.
179. 10: आत्मनो मनः सर्वेषां अपचितिं
कर्तुं प्रवणं उन्मुखं इच्छन् स्व-
मनोपचितिं कर्तुं योजयतीत्य् अर्थः);
the dead Bhṛgus then descended from the
world of Fathers (पितृलोकाद् उपागम्य)
and asked him to control his anger; they
assured him that the Bhṛgus disregarded
their getting killed by Kṣatriyas not because
of their weakness; they preferred getting
killed by Kṣatriyas because they themselves
were tired of their long life (आयुषा हि
प्रकृष्टेन यदा नः खेद आविशत्।तदा-
स्माभिर् वधस् तात क्षत्रियैर् ईप्सितः
स्वयम्॥); some one hid wealth in the
house of a Bhṛgu in order to anger Kṣatri-
yas; Bhṛgus desired heaven, and had no
longing for wealth, however, death was
powerless to overtake Bhṛgus and suicide
would deprive them from getting good
worlds; hence they found some other way
out (to get killed by Kṣatriyas); what
Aurva had wanted to achieve by the
exercise of his penance was not approved
by Bhṛgus; so they asked him to desist
from doing the sinful act of destroying
the worlds 1. 170. 11-21; (2) Cyavana
told Kuśika the above account and added
that due to the energy of Bhṛgus (भृगू-
णाम् एव तेजसा) in his dynasty his grand-
son would be an ascetic Brāhmaṇa (विप्र
for विप्रः ?) having the lustre of fire; he
also told him that a matrimonial alliance
would be established between him (Kuśi-
ka's line) and the Bhṛgus (भविता त्वं
च संबन्धी भृगूणां भावितात्मनाम्)
13. 56. 1-14); (भृगूणां कुशिकानां च
प्रति संबन्धकारणम्) 13. 56. 19; (3)
Rāma Jāmadagnya filled at Samantapañ-
caka five ponds with blood of Kṣatriyas
where he offered libations to his fore-
fathers (i. e. Bhṛgus) (त्रिःसप्तकृत्वः
पृथिवीं कृत्वा निःक्षत्रियां प्रभुः।
समन्तपञ्चके पञ्च चकार रुधिरह्र-
दान्॥स तेषु तर्पयाम् आस पितॄन् भृगु-
कुलोद्वहः) 3. 117. 9-10; (4) Vāyu told
Arjuna (Kārtavīrya) that he would face
in future a great danger from the Bhṛgus
(भृगुभ्यस् ते भयं घोरं … ) 13.
142. 23; (5) As an instance of the super-
iority of Brahmanical lustre and strength
over that of the Kṣatriyas was cited the
past event of Bhṛgus defeating Tālajaṅghas
(भृगवो ऽजयंस् तालजङ्घान्) 13. 34. 16;
(6) Bhṛgus and Aṅgirases mentioned
among those who attended the anointment
of Skanda as the leader of the army of the
gods 9. 44. 8; (7) At the Raudra मुहूर्त
Indra saw in the east Agni entering the
sun with offerings which were offered by
Aṅgirases and Bhṛgus 3. 213. 29.

Duryodhana assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that he
would defeat Matsyas (मत्स्यांश् च … श्रो-
तासि विजितान् मया) 5. 60. 25; Karṇa assured
Duryodhana that he would kill Matsyas
with his ब्रह्मास्त्र 5. 61. 5; (20) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira was prepared for peace for only
five villages although he was supported,
among others, by Matsyas ( … मत्स्यैश् च
मधुसूदन।भवता चैव नाथेन पञ्च
ग्रामा वृता मया) 5. 70. 14; (21) Mat-
syas included among those who protected
the army of Duryodhana (राजचमूं समे-
ताम्। … गुप्ताम् … समत्स्यैः) 5. 158. 19-
20; they are listed among the twelve heroic
Janapadas whose chariot-fighters protected
Bhīṣma in the war (द्वादशैते जनपदाः
सर्वे शूरास् तनूत्यजः।महता रथ-
वंशेन ते ऽभ्यरक्षन् पितामहं॥)
6. 18. 13-14; at the start of the war,
Matsyas were stationed in the middle
of the army (सर्वसैन्यस्य मध्ये)
6. 20. 12 (were these Matsyas on the
side of the Kauravas from Aparamatsya
of the south who had fled from the main
stock due to fear of Jarāsandha ? 2. 28.
4; 2. 13. 27); (22) On the first day
of war, Bhīṣma killed (पातयाम् आस)
Matsyas (those fighting for Pāṇḍavas) 6.

showered many arrows on them (ववर्ष
शरवर्षाणि) 6. 48. 9; Matsyas (on the
Pāṇḍavas' side) led by Bhīma attacked
Niṣādas 6. 50. 8; later, when Bhīma killed
Kaliṅgas, they honoured him 6. 50. 110;
(24) On the third day, Matsyas led by
Aśvatthāman and Kṛpa were stationed at
the head of the Garuḍavyūha (6. 52. 2) of
Kauravas 6. 52. 4; those who fought on the
side of Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar when
they attacked the army of Kauravas 6. 55.
126; (25) On the fifth day, Matsyas
marched on Duryodhana and Śakuni 6. 67.
20; they surrounded Arjuna fighting with
Bhīṣma (परिवव्रुस् तदा पार्थम्) 6. 70. 33;
(26) On the tenth day, Bhīṣma alone killed
innumerable horses and elephants as also
seven great warriors (सप्त महारथाः)
from Matsyas and Pāñcālas; he also killed
five thousand chariot-fighters and fourteen
thousand foot-soldiers (पञ्च सहस्राणि
रथिनाम् … ।नराणां च … सहस्राणि चतुर्-
दश) 6. 113. 21-22. Matsya and Pāñcāla
warriors, while attacking Bhīṣma, raised
cries (किलकिलाशब्दः); they covered him
(छादयाम् आसुः) with excellent horses,
hosts of chariots and elephants and foot-
soldiers 6. 113. 47-48; (27) Dhṛtarāṣṭra
enquired who opposed Droṇa when he
wanted to fight with the chariot-fighters
(रथानीकम्) of Virāṭa, the Matsya 7.
9. 67; he imagined that Dhṛṣṭadyumna
must have killed Droṇa when he was
encircled and excessively distracted by
Matsyas and the rest (तैर् वृतः सर्वतः
 … मत्स्यैर् अन्यैश् च भूमिपईः व्याकुली-
कृतम् आचार्यम्) 7. 8. 27-28; (28) On
the eleventh day, after assuming charge of
the Kaurava army when Droṇa attacked
Pāṇḍavas, their heroes and army, includ-
ing Matsyas, checked his advance (and
that of his army); that angered Droṇa
(पर्यगृह्णंस् ततः सर्वे समायान्तम् …
संगृह्यमाणां तां दृष्ट्वा … वाहिनीम्)
7. 7. 4, 7; assisted by Matsyas Virāṭa
opposed Karṇa 7. 13. 36; Pāṇḍavas along
with Matsyas held back Kaurava chariot-
fighters headed by Aśvatthāman 7. 15.
11; (29) On the twelfth day, Matsyas
attacked Droṇa when he killed Satyajit;
they fled when Droṇa killed Śatānīka;
Droṇa defeated Matsyas 7. 20. 18, 22-23;
mighty Droṇa threw Matsyas into disorder
(व्यक्षोभयत्) who were very much anger-
ed due to the death of a Pāñcālya prince;
when they got killed they trembled
(मत्स्याः समकम्पन्त) 7. 20. 49, 53;
pushed back by the arrows of Droṇa they
were shaken (चलितान्) 7. 21. 7; Karṇa
pointed out to Duryodhana Matsyas who,
when instigated by Bhīma, followed him
7. 21. 23; the war between Matsyas and
Kekayas (on the side of Kauravas) in
which horses, elephants and chariot-fighters
were not afraid became extremely confused
(उत्पिञ्जलकं युद्धम् … अभीताश्वरथ-
द्विपम्) 7. 24. 21 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 25.
21: उत्पिञ्जलकम् अत्यन्ताकुलम्); (30)
On the thirteenth day, when Abhimanyu
attempted to break through the चक्रव्यूह
Matsyas were to follow him 7. 34. 22; led
by Yudhiṣṭhira they attacked the army of
Droṇa to break it (द्रोणानीकं बिभित्स-
वः) 7. 39. 17; striking Matsyas arranged
properly their forces (व्यूढानीकाः प्र-
हारिणः) and attacked Kaurava army; as
a result Kaurava army turned back 7. 41.
3-4; Matsyas tried to attack Jayadratha
7. 42. 18; when Abhimanyu's death was
reported to Subhadrā she expressed her
disgust for Matsyas and others who could
not help Abhimanyu (धिक् … मत्स्याञ् … )
7. 55. 13; (31) On the fourteenth day,
Matsyas led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, rushed
straight towards Droṇa in order to help
Sātyaki (आजग्मुर् अञ्जसा) 7. 73. 50; Droṇa
defeated hundreds and thousands of
Matsyas (अजयन् महाबाहुः शतशो ऽथ
सहस्रशः) 7. 85. 31; Droṇa uttered
loudly his own name while attacking oppo-
nents (नाम विश्राव्य संयुगे) and killed
many Matsyas (प्रचक्रे कदनं महत्)
7. 98. 26; Yudhiṣṭhira remembered Arjuna's
former victory over Kauravas when Pāṇḍas
vas lived in the town of Matsyas 7. 103.
38; at the advent of night, Matsyas led by
Virāṭa attacked Droṇa (सायाह्ने 7. 129. 5;
बभूव रजनी घोरा 7. 129. 12) 7. 129, 7;
(32) During the night-war (14th-15th day)
Matsyas followed Arjuna and Bhīma who
intended to oppress respectively the sou-
thern and the northern flanks of Kaurava
army (बीभत्सुर् दक्षिणं पार्श्वम् उत्त-
रं तु वृकोदरः) 7. 132. 40-41; 7. 136.
14; Duryodhana asked Karṇa to protect
the army which was engulfed by angered
Matsyas (मत्स्यकैकेयैः … ।वृतान् समन्-
तात् संक्रुद्धैर्) 7. 133. 2-3; when every-
body believed that Duryodhana was killed
by Bhīma, Matsyas rushed towards Droṇa
to fight with him with utmost effort (सर्वो-
द्योगेनाभिजग्मुर् द्रोणम् एव युयुत्सया)
7. 141. 60; Droṇa defeated all Matsyas
and even killed many of them (मत्स्यांश्
चैवाजयत् सर्वान् … हतेषु मत्स्येषु) 7.
161. 32. 35; (33) On the fifteenth day,
Yudhiṣṭhira urged Matsya heroes (नरर्-
षभान्) to go to help Bhīma and others;
then their chariot-fighters attacked Droṇa
7. 164. 48-53; Droṇa killed five hundred
Matsyas with his ब्रह्मास्त्र (पञ्चशतान्
मत्स्यान्) 7. 164. 85, 79; later, Kṛpa inform-
ed Aśvatthāman that when Matsyas tried
to attack Droṇa they perished as dictated
by Fate (संख्ये द्रोणरथं प्राप्य
व्यनशन् कालचोदिताः) 7. 165. 101; Aśvat-
thāman promised Duryodhana that he
would rout Matsyas by his नारायणास्त्र
(विद्रावयिष्यामि) 7. 166. 52; when Pāṇḍava
army was routed by Aśvatthāman, Arjuna
supported by Matsyas faced Kauravas 7.
172. 3; (34) On the sixteenth day, Matsyas
and the rest surrounded Karṇa with their
chariots, horses, elephants and valorous
foot-soldiers and struck him with various
weapons; bent on killing Karṇa they spoke
harsh words to him (भाषन्तो वाग्भिर्
उग्राभिः सर्वे कर्णवधे वृताः) 8. 21. 26-
27; Karṇa scattered them away (अपोवाह)
and killed them 8. 21. 28-29; (35) On
the seventeenth day, Kṛpa, Kṛtavarman
and Śakuni fought with Matsyas; prepared
for the fight (दंशिताः), they attacked
Karṇa and struck him with various wea-
pons and showers of arrows 8. 32. 17, 43-
44; the surviving Matsyas (मत्स्यशेषाः),
to help Yudhiṣṭhira, checked Karṇa 8. 33.
22; Matsyas and others, protected by
Arjuna were able to reduce the army of
Kauravas (कृतः शत्रुगणक्षयः) 8. 51.
6; Kṛṣṇa remembered that earlier in the
war, Bhīṣma had killed Matsyas with
arrows 8. 51. 27; when Matsyas were gett-
ing killed (वध्यमानाः) they attacked
Karṇa and afflicted him with arrows
(शरसंघैः समार्दयन्); but Karṇa
killed them with sharp arrows 8. 56. 24;
later, when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was informed that
Karṇa was killed by Arjuna he remembered
Karṇa's former victory over Matsyas
8. 5. 18; (36) On the last day of the
war, Matsyas, especially, were again
delighted while encouraging Yudhiṣṭhira
to fulfil his vow to kill Śalya (ततः प्र-
हर्षः … पुनर् आसीत् … ।मत्स्यानां च
विशेषतः।प्रतिज्ञां … धर्मराजस्य
पूरयन्॥) 9. 15. 26-27; beholding the
feat of Śālva, Matsyas uttered cries of
despair; their excellent heroes obstru-
cted the elephant of Śālva from all sides
(हाहाकारैर् नादयन्तः स्म युद्धे।
द्विपं समन्ताद् रुरुधुर् नराग्र्याः) 9.
19. 21; (37) Night of the eighteenth day:
after the massacre in the camp of Pāṇḍavas,
Aśvatthāman boasted that he had killed
all the surviving Matsyas and reported the
event to Duryodhana (मत्स्यशेषाश् च सर्वे
विनिहता मया) 10. 8. 150; 10. 9. 49; the
event later reported to Kuntī by Yudhiṣṭhira
15. 44. 33-34; (38) Gāndhārī pointed
out to Kṛṣṇa the women of noble family of
Virāṭa (मत्स्यराजकुलस्त्रियः) trying to
take away Uttarā from the dead body of
Abhimanyu; then they themselves, more
afflicted, cried and lamented over the
death of Virāṭa 11. 20. 27-28.
E. Past
event: King Sahaja of Cedis and Matsyas
listed by Bhīma among eighteen kings who
extirpated their kinsmen, friends and rela-
tives 5. 72. 16.

मद्र
Madra, Madraka m. (pl.): Name of
a country and its people; referred to as
Madraka specially when derision was in-
tended (8. अध्यायस् 27, 30); otherwise
मद्रक for मद्र very likely due to
metrical reasons.
A. Location: Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of Bhāratavarṣa (अत
ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध) 6. 10. 37, 5;
(सौधा मद्रा … ) 6. 10. 40.
B. Origin:
Bhadrā, wife of Vyuṣitāśva, gave birth to
four Madra sons (सा … सुषुवे देवी …
चतुरो मद्रान् सुतान् … ) 1. 112. 33.
C.
Description: Of their warriors; brave
(शूर) 9. 17. 4, 14, 35; heroic (वीर) 9. 7.
23; 9. 17. 1, 17; energetic (तरस्विन्) 9. 22.
25; of great valour (महावीर्य) 8. 31. 21;
great chariot-fighters (महारथ) 8. 32.
19; 9. 6. 7; 9. 17. 5, 11; skilled in fight-
ing while riding elephants (गजयोधिन्;
गजयुद्धेषु कुशलाः) 8. 17. 2-3; great
archers (महेष्वास) 9. 17. 23; versed in
the science of archery (धनुर्वेदविद्) and
difficult to be conquered by enemies (अजेयाः
शत्रुभिर् युधि) 6. 57. 13; of the people in
general; wicked (दुरात्मन्) 8. 27. 71, 74;
vile, of despicable speech (नराधम,
क्षुद्रवाक्य) 8. 27. 73; untruthful, not
straightforward (नित्यं चानृतिको ऽनृजुः)
8. 27. 74; croocked (जिह्म) 8. 30. 62;
imprudent (अचेतस्) 8. 30. 55; fickle
(मद्रको हि सचापलः) 8. 27. 80; their
country rated by Karṇa as reprehensible
(कुदेश), sinful (पापदेश) 8. 27. 67-68,
70, 91.
D. Their nature, behaviour:
Although they lived in countries they led
the life of Dasyus (सर्वे विषयवासिनः। …
सर्वे ते दस्युजीविनः॥) 12. 65. 15; Karṇa
repeated for Śalya गाथास् describing the
nature and behaviour of Madrakas, which
were once recited by certain Brāhmaṇas in
the royal assembly of Kurus: a Madraka
was a habitual violator of contracts; who-
ever hated Brāhmaṇas was a Madraka;
there could be no companionship with a
Madraka; Madrakas were wicked to the
bitter end (मित्रध्रुङ् मद्रको नित्यं
यो नो द्वेष्टि स मद्रकः।मद्रके
संगतं नास्ति … यावदन्तं हि दौरा-
त्म्यं मद्रकेष्व् इति नः श्रुतम्॥) 8.
27. 73-74; Madraka men and women
united with one another without regard
for family or any other relationship; they
could never be religious; they ate churn-
ed meal, drank wine, ate beef, roared
and danced 8. 27. 75-78; one should
neither form friendship nor have enmity
with Madrakas with whom religion was lost
and whose unauspicious deeds were well
known (मद्रकेषु विलुप्तेषु प्रख्याता-
शुभकर्मसु।नापि वैरं न सौहार्दं
मद्रकेषु समाचरेत्॥) 8. 27. 79; one
should not touch Madrakas (मद्रकेषु च
दुःस्पर्शम्) 8. 27. 80; Madraka women
are severely criticized for their shameful
acts and licentious behaviour 8. 27. 85-
89; from beginning to the end Madrakas
followed reprehensible bad paths; they
were म्लेच्छस् born in sinful countries
and had no sense of religion; there could
be no question of their knowing धर्म
(शक्यं वक्तुं भवेद् बहु।आ केशाग्रान्
नखाग्राच् च वक्तव्येषु कुवर्त्मसु॥
मद्रका … धर्मं विद्युः कथं त्य्
थ।पापदेशोद्भवा म्लेच्छा धर्माणाम्
अविचक्षणाः॥) 8. 27. 90-91; one of the
old Brāhmaṇas who had visited many
countries, when he met Dhṛtarāṣṭra, he
condemned Bāhlīkas and also Madras
(मद्रांश् च कुत्सयन् वाक्यम् अब्रवीत्)
8. 30. 9; therefore what he said despising
specifically the Bāhlīkas applied also to
Madrakas 8. 30. 10-26; a certain Brāh-
maṇa told an artisan (शील्पिन्) what he
had heard about Madrakas: among
Madrakas in every family there was only
one wise person, the rest behaved as they
liked; their behaviour led to confusion
of धर्म (भवत्य् एकः कुले विप्रः
शिष्टान्ये कामचारिणः।एतन् मया श्रुतं
तत्र धर्मसंकरकारकम्।) 8. 30. 55-
56; another Brāhmaṇa told the Kuru
assembly describing Madras as croocked
and said that all countries, except Madras
and Pañcanadas, followed the ancient
धर्म (धर्मं पुराणम् उपजीवन्ति
सन्तो मद्रान् ऋते पञ्चनदांश् च जिह्मान्)
8. 30. 62; according to a Rākṣasa named
Kalmāṣapāda, who was held by a king,
Madra women were as good as the
dirt on the bodies of women (स्त्रीणां
मद्रस्त्रियो मलम्) 8. 30. 68; he further
said that the dirt on the bodies of Madra-
kas, whose sacrifices were performed by
those whose sacrificial priests were of
warrior class, would be the dirt of the
king if he did not release Kalmāṣapāda
(राजयाजकयाज्यानां मद्रकाणां च यन्
मलम्।तद् भवेद् वै तव मलं यद्य्
अस्मान् न विमुञ्चसि॥) 8. 30. 71.
E.
Epic events: (1) Bhīṣma went to the town
of Madras (मद्राणां पुटभेदनम्) and

birth of Arjuna (जातमात्रे कुमारे तु 1.
114. 28) a noncorporeal voice prophesied
that he (Arjuna) would bring Madras under
control (मद्रान् वशे कृत्वा) 1. 114. 31;
(according to a later reference, this event
happened a week after Arjuna was born
सप्ताहजाते त्वयि 8. 48. 6); (3) Nakula in
his expedition to the west before the Rāja-
sūya (2. 29. 2; 1. 23. 10) went to Śākala,
the town of Madras (मद्राणाम् पुट-
भेदनम्) and subdued Śalya with affection
(प्रीतिपूर्वेण … चक्रे वशे बली) 2. 29.
13; (4) Madra Kṣatriyas brought wealth
in hundreds as tribute for Yudhiṣṭhira

शतशो ऽजातशत्रवे) 2. 48. 13, 16; (5)
On the second day of war, Madrakas
were to protect Bhīṣma (मद्रकाः …

On the third day, Madrakas (मद्रकाः)
were posted at the ‘neck’ (ग्रीवायाम्) of
the Gāruḍavyūha of Kauravas 6. 52. 2, 5;
(7) On the fourth day, principal Madra
warriors (मद्राश् च … मुख्याः) with
Trigartas and Kekayas, thirtyfive thousand
strong, encircled Arjuna and Abhimanyu;
then Dhṛṣṭadyumna, assisted by a large
army, attacked Madraka army (मद्रका-
नीकम्) and killed them, each one with

दशभिः शरैः) 6. 57. 12-13, 16, 19;
(8) On the fifth day, Madras collected
round the king of Kaliṅgas 6. 67. 13; (9)

6. 71. 18, 14; (10) On the eleventh day,
Madras led by Duryodhana followed
Karṇa in the Śakaṭavyūha of Kauravas 7.
6. 6-7, 15; (11) On the twelfth day,
Suśarman, supported by Madrakas (सहितो
मद्रकैर् अपि), took oath to kill Arjuna
7. 16. 20; on that day, Madras stood at
the neck (ग्रीवायाम्) of the Suparṇavyūha
(7. 19. 4) by hundreds of thousands with
elephants, horses, chariots and foot-soldiers
(मद्रकेकयाः।गजाश्वरथपत्त्यौघास्
तस्थुः शतसहस्रशः॥) 7. 19. 8; Madras
were also posted at the back of the Vyūha
(पृष्ठे … पौण्ड्रमद्रकाः) 7. 19. 11;
(12) During the night war, Yudhiṣṭhira
killed a large number of Madrakas
(मद्रकाणां गणान् युधि) 7. 132. 25;
Arjuna did the same 7. 136. 5; (13) In
the summary narration of the first
fifteen days of war Saṃjaya mentioned
Madrakas among those who were killed
by Arjuna (मालवा मद्रकाश् चैव) 8. 4.
46; (14) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that
Karṇa had once defeated Madrakas
and made them pay tribute (अजईषीद्॥।
मद्रकान् … यो जित्वा समरे वीरश् चक्रे
बलिभृतः पुरा) 8. 5. 18, 20; (a reference
to Karṇa's दिग्विजय before Duryodhana's
Vaiṣṇavayāga (3. 241. 29, 32; 3. App. I.
24. 28-34); (15) On the sixteenth day,
Śalya with his large army of Madra warriors
stood at the left foot of the Makaravyūha
of Kauravas (अनुपादस् तु वामस् …
महत्या सेनया सार्धं मद्रदेशसमु-
त्थया॥) 8. 7. 19, 14; on the same
day, elephant drivers drove Madra and
other warriors, skilled in fighting battles
while riding elephants; they showered
Dhṛṣṭadyumna with arrows, तोमरस् and
नाराच arrows; Dhṛṣṭadyumna pierced the
enemy elephants with arrows—each one
with ten, six or eight arrows; the Pāṇḍava
warriors succeeded in routing the attack of
the elephants (हस्तिभिस् तु महामात्रास् …
पार्षतम् अभ्ययुः॥ … गजयोधिनः …
मद्रा दशार्णा … गजयुद्धेषु कुश-
लाः … ॥) 8. 17. 1-6; (एवं हत्वा तव
गजान्) 8. 17. 28; (16) On the seventeenth
day, Duryodhana, protected by Madras and
Kekayas, followed Duḥśāsana, who was
at the back (व्यूहस्य पृष्ठतः) of the
Bārhaspatyavyūha of Kauravas 8. 31. 19,
21, 26; Duryodhana protected by Madra
महारथस् was guarding Karṇa from all
sides 8. 32. 19; angered Bhīma fought with
Madras along with Kurus and Kekayas;
he killed their chariot-fighters by thousands
along with their charioteers, horses, ele-
phants and foot-soldiers 8. 40. 69, 71-73;
(17) On the eighteenth day, when Śalya
was consecrated as the सेनापति of Kaura-
vas, Madrakas were delighted and they
praised Śalya (हृष्टाश् चासन् … मद्रकाश् च
 … ।तुष्टुवुश् चैव) 9. 6. 7; Śalya was at the
head of the Sarvatobhadravyūha (मुखं
व्यूहस्य) along with Madraka heroes
(मद्रकैः सहितो वीरैः) 9. 7. 23, 19;
(18) On the eighteenth day, Duryodhana
tried to check seven hundred chariot-fighters
of Madras who rushed forward from the
main army to continue to fight even after
the death of Śalya (मद्रराजपदानुगाः।
रथाः सप्त शता वीरा निर्ययुर् महतो
बलात्॥न गन्तव्यं न गन्तव्यम् इति
मद्रान् अवारयत्); though they were repea-
tedly asked to stop marching forward,
Madras entered the army of Pāṇḍavas to
kill Yudhiṣṭhira; intent on fighting (कृत-
चित्ताः स्म योधने) they made twangs
from their bows and fought with Pāṇḍavas
9. 17. 1-4; Arjuna rushed to help Yudhi-
ṣṭhira who was oppressed by great Madra
chariot-fighters desirous of doing what
was dear to the king of Madras (धर्म-
पुत्रं च पीडितम्।मद्रराजप्रिये युक्तैर्
मद्रकाणां महारथैः॥); encircled
by Pāṇḍavas, Madra heroes repeatedly
agitated their army (ते समन्तात् परिवृताः
पाण्डवैः पुरुषर्षभाः।क्षोभयन्ति
स्म तां सेनाम्॥।।;अक्षोभ्यत तदा
राजन् पाण्डूनां ध्वजिनी पुणः); fighting
whole-heartedly the Madra chariot-fighters
made their opponents tremble (त्यक्ता-
त्मानः … कम्पयन्ति स्म) 9. 17. 5, 9-
11; they shouted loudly asking the where-
abouts of Yudhiṣṭhira and other Pāṇḍava
warriors; Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki
attacked them; Madras, with the wheels
of their chariots and flag-staffs broken,
were killed by Pāṇḍavas 9. 17. 12, 14-
15; when they again rushed at Pāṇḍavas,
Duryodhana tried to pacify them urging
them to return; but no one listened to him
9. 17. 16-17; Śakuni blamed Duryodhana
since Madras were being killed in the
very presence of Kaurava heroes; he
reminded him that Kurus and Madras
had decided to fight together (सहितैर् नाम
योद्धव्यम् इत्य् एष समयः कृतः) 9. 17.
17-20; when Duryodhana complained that
the Madra warriors did not listen to him
when he tried to check them, Śakuni told
him that angered fighters do not obey the
orders of their seniors; that was not the
time either to get angry with Madras or
neglect them (अलं क्रोद्धुं तथल्तेषां
नायं काल उपेक्षितुम्); he advised Duryo-
dhana collectively to go to save the great
(Madra) archers who were loyal to Śalya
(परित्रातुं महेष्वासान् मद्रराजपदानु-
गान्) 9. 17. 21-24; accordingly Duryo-
dhana with his large army went to the
help of Madra warriors; Pāṇḍavas, seeing
Madra warriors fighting, attacked them;
in the battle that ensued Madras were
killed 9. 17. 25-28; the battle described
9. 17. 30-37; when Duryodhana's army
realized that the large army of Śalya was
being killed, they again turned away from
the scene of fight (ततो हतम् अभिप्रेक्ष्य
मद्रराजबलं महत्।दुर्योधनबलं
सर्वं पुनर् आसीत् पराङ्मुखम्) 9. 17. 38;
Śakuni told the energetic (तरस्विनः)
Madra warriors to attack the vanguard
of the Pāṇḍava army and that he himself,
would take in the rear (युध्यध्वम्
अग्रतो यावत् पृष्ठतो हन्मि पाण्डवान्);
they raised sound and attacked Pāṇḍavas
who showered arrows and killed the
army of Śalya; seeing that, Duryo-
dhana's army again turned away; Śakuni
again blamed them and pointed out that
the Madra army consisting of ten thousand
horses and fighting with bright lances had
fought heroically and brought about great
destruction of the enemies (अनीकं दश-
साहस्रम् अश्वानां … ।आसिद् गान्धारराजस्य
विमलप्रासयोधिनाम्।बलेन तेन विक्र-
म्य वर्तमाने जनक्षये) 9. 22. 24-30.
F. Past event; Māndhātṛ once asked Indra
how kings like him could make Madrakas
who lived like Dasyus, follow religion and
how he could control them (कथं धर्-

स्थाप्या … ); thereupon Indra told him the
duties of Dasyus 12. 65. 13, 15, 17-22.

उपाद्रवन्) 2. 19. 12, 17 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2.
21. 15: चैत्यकं नगरसूचकम्); when
they had entered the town, the Magadha
people, seeing them, were wonderstruck
2. 19. 19, 27; Kṛṣṇa advised Jarāsandha
not to disregard others because he had
the support of the large and strong army
of Māgadhas (मागधैर् विपुलैः सैन्यैर्
बाहुल्यबलदर्पितैः) 2. 20. 18; hearing
the loud roar of Bhīma and Jarāsandha
the people of Magadha were much afraid,
their pregnant women lost their foetus
(स्त्रीणां गर्भाश् च सुस्रुवुः); they
wondered whether the Himālaya had
broken down or whether the earth was
being torn apart (किं नु स्विद् धिमवान्
भिन्नः किं नु स्विद् दीर्यते मही।इति स्म
मागधा जज्ञुर् … ) 2. 22. 8-9; when the

Magadha; there he pacified the son of
Jarāsandha and collected tribute from him
(ततः सुह्मान् प्राच्यसुह्मान् … विजित्य …

यित्वा करे च विनिवेश्य ह) 2. 27. 14, 16;

On the fourth day, the Magadha army of
ten thousand energetic elephants led by
Jayatsena (not named) attacked Bhīma

स्विनां।मागधं पुरतः कृत्वा भीम-
सेनं समभ्ययात्॥) 6. 58. 31; (10)
On the eighth day, Bhagadatta, along
with Māgadha warriors and others follow-
ed Droṇa in the Mahāvyūha of Kauravas

Māgadhas and others were stationed at the
back (पृष्ठे) of the Suparṇavyūha of the
Kauravas 7. 19. 11, 4-5; (12) On the
fourteenth day, when Vyāghradatta was
killed by Sātyaki, Māgadhas rushed towards
Sātyaki and showered him with arrows and
तोमरस् by thousands and also with
भिण्डिपाल, प्रास and मुद्गर; but Sātyaki
easily defeated them all and they fled 7. 82.
33-36; (13) After the death of Droṇa,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, lamenting, recalled Kṛṣṇa's
exploits which included his victory over
Māgadhas 7. 10. 15; (14) On the sixteenth
day, Māgadhas (on Pāṇḍavas' side) attack-
ed the Kaurava army (मागधाश् चापि
दुद्रुवुः) 8. 8. 19; (15) The same day,
Māgadhas and others on the side of Kaura-
vas, skilled in fighting while riding ele-
phants, were driven by the elephant-riders
towards Dhṛṣṭadyumna; they showered
him with arrows, तोमरस् and नाराचस्;
Dhṛṣṭadyumna pierced the elephants of
the enemies with arrows-each one with
ten, six or eight arrows; Dhṛṣṭadyumna
and Pāṇḍava heroes succeeded in routing
the attack of elephants (हस्तिभिस् तु
महामात्रा … पार्षतम् अभ्ययुः॥ … गज-
योधिनः। … मागधास् ताम्रलिप्तकाः॥
गजयुद्देषु कुशलाः … ) 8. 17. 1-6; (एवं
हत्वा तव गजान्॥) 8. 17. 28; (16) On
the seventeenth day, Kṛpa, along with the
energetic Māgadha warriors, stood on the
right side of the Bārhaspatyavyūha (8. 31.
26) of the Kauravas (कृपः शारद्वतो
राजन् मागधश् च (for मागधाश् च ?)
तरस्विनः।सात्वतः कृतवर्मा च दक्षि-
णं पक्षम् आश्रिताः॥ 8. 31. 11 (the cr.
edn. adopts the reading मागधः (sg.);
but it is almost certain that we have to
read मागधाः (pl.); the plural तरस्विनः
is hardly meant to include Kṛpa, Kṛtavar-
man and some Māgadha prince (sg.); he
cannot be Jayatsena since he was already
killed by Abhimanyu; adjective like
तरस्विनः are used with reference to
general warriors; there are variant read-
ings to support मागधाः; the editor has
no note on the stanza); the same day,
Bhīma killed many Māgadhas (siding
with Kauravas) 8. 49. 79; (17) On the
eighteenth day, to praise Bhīma before his
duel with Duryodhana, Kṛṣṇa reminded
him that he had formerly killed many
Māgadhas along with other warriors 9.
32. 32; (18) After the war Gāndhārī
pointed out to Kṛṣṇa Māgadhī women,
who in grief had discarded their gold
ornaments, surrounding the dead body
of Jayatsena and weeping; they rolled on
the ground; their wailing sound deluded
the mind of Gāndhārī ( … प्ररुदिता
मागध्यः पश्य योषितः॥प्रकीर्ण-
स्वर्णाभरणा रुदन्त्यः शोककर्शिताः। …
मागध्यः शेरते भुवि॥) 11. 25. 7, 9;
(आसां … मनःश्रुतिहरो नादो मनो
मोहयतीव मे) 11. 25. 8; (19) While
recounting Kṛṣṇa's past exploits, Vasu-
deva remembered that Kṛṣṇa had slain
Māgadha Kings (चक्रे (विदेहान्) कालिङ्ग-
मागधान्) 16. 7. 10.
E. Past events;
(1) The eight sons of Asurī Kālakā
were born as kings; the first of them,
the great Asura, was Jayatsena who was
the illustrious king of the Magadha country
(कालकायास् तु ये पुत्रास् तेषाम् अष्टौ
नराधिपाः।जज्ञिरे … ॥मगधेषु जयत्-
सेनः श्रीमान् आसीत् स पार्थिवः।अष्टानां
प्रवरस् तेषां कालेयानां महासुरः॥)
1. 61. 45-46; (2) Kākṣīva(t) and others
were born of Śūdrā Auśīnarī from the
magnanimous sage Gautama in Maga-
dha; Gautama took his residence in
Magadha; since the kings favoured him,
he took resort with the Magadha dynasty
(शूद्रायां गौतमो यत्र महात्मा सं-
शितव्रतः।औशीनर्याम् अजनयत् काक्षीवा-
दीन् सुतान् ऋषिः॥गौतमः क्षयणाद् अस्माद्

 … ॥ … म्लेच्छजातयः।) 6. 10. 63, 64, 5;
in the north (उदीच्यां दिशि यद् वृत्तं
म्लेच्छेषु) 12. 162. 28; on the foot-hills
of Himavant: Pāṇḍavas saw them on
their way to Gandhamādana (देशान्
म्लेच्छगणाकीर्णान् … ददृशुर् गिरिपादांश्
च) 3. 145. 12; they lived also in the in-
accessible places of the Himavant moun-
tain (हिमवद्दुर्गवासिनाम्) 7. 87. 37; some
lived on the Vindhya mountain as well
(विन्ध्यनिलया म्लेच्छाः) 12. 59. 103; in
forests in general (वनं … म्लेच्छतस्क-
रनिषेवितम्) 3. 61. 2; located also in east
and south (प्राच्याश् च दाक्षिणात्याश् च; ते
म्लेच्छैः प्रेषिता नागाः) 8. 17. 2, 9; near
the oceans: they lived by the gulf of the
western ocean (reference to Nakula's
expedition to the west 2. 29. 2) (सागर-
कुक्षिस्थान् म्लेच्छान्) 2. 29. 15; along the
eastern ocean (सागरानूपवासिभिः) -here
they are mentioned along with Bhagadatta
of the east 2. 31. 9-10; 2. 47. 12; along
the ocean in general (सागरानूपगांश्
चैव) 3. 48. 19; (सागरानूपवासिनः) 8.
51. 19; समुद्रवासिनः) 1. 202. 8; on the
islands of the eastern ocean (reference

ocean (reference to Sahadeva's expedi-
tion to the south 2. 28. 1) (सागरद्वीप-
वासांश् च नृपतीन् म्लेच्छयोनिजान्) 2. 28.
44; along the seacoast in Vaṅga, Puṇḍra
and Kerala (see epic event No. 15); they
did not exist in the Varṣas of the द्वीपस्
of Uttara Kuru (न तेषु दस्यवः सन्ति
म्लेच्छजात्योऽपि वा … ) 6. 13. 15, 1.
C.
Different Origins: (1) In the bygone
days, the sages churned the right thigh
of king Vena whom they had killed;
from it arose a dwarfish person (ह्रस्वा-
ङ्गः); him, the sages said ‘sit down’
(निषीद); from him were born Niṣādas
and other Mlecchas in hundreds and
thousands living on Vindhya mountain
(तस्मान् निषादाः संभूताः … ये चान्ये
विन्ध्यनिलयाः म्लेच्छाः शतसहस्रशः)
12. 59. 101-103; (2) Mlecchas were
produced by Nandinī, Vasiṣṭha's cow, from
her foam; they and other peoples produced
by Nandinī formed a large army; they wore
different armours and held different wea-
pons (म्लेच्छान् फेनतः सा ससर्ज ह॥
तैर् विसृष्टैर् महत् सैन्यं नानाम्लेच्छ-
गणैस् तदा।नानावरणसंछन्नैर् नाना-
युधधरैस् तथा) 1. 165. 36-37 (perhaps,
here the term म्लेच्छगण is used to in-
clude Pallavas and others who were also
then produced by Nandinī); the origin
of Mlecchas from cows also referred to in
7. 68. 42 (गोयोनिप्रभवा म्लेच्छाः) and
in 7. 87. 36 (सन्ति गोयोनयश् चात्र); (3)
All Mleccha tribes sprang from Anu, the
son of Yayāti (अनोस् तु म्लेच्छजातयः) 1.
80. 26; (4) Originally all were Brāhmaṇas
(न विशेषो ऽस्ति वर्णानां सर्वं ब्राह्मम्
इदं जगत्) 12. 181. 10; later, Brāhmaṇas
who did not know (the धर्म and did not
observe the vows and regulations) became
different tribes such as Mlecchas (ब्रह्म
चैतत् पुरा सृष्टं ये न जानन्त्य् अतद्विदः।
तेषां बहुविधास् त्व् अन्यास् तत्र तत्र हि
जातयः। … बहुधा म्लेच्छजातयः) 12.
181. 18; (5) Sinful men who lived under
the influence of greed and temptation were
born as Mlecchas who did not deserve
to be associated with (असंवासाः प्रजा-
यन्ते म्लेच्छाश् चापि न संशयः।नराः
पापसमाचारा लोभमोहसमन्विताः॥) 13.
112. 108.
D. Description and characte-
ristics: (1) Of Mlecchas in general: im-
pure (अशुचि) 7. 68. 44; sinful (पाप) 1. 79.
13; (पापकर्तृ) 7. 87. 37; bad (असत्)
7. 87. 37; cruel, harsh in all acts, eat
anything (म्लेच्छाः क्रूराः सर्वभक्षा
दारुणाः सर्वकर्मसु) 3. 188. 52; 6. 10.
64; (परमदारुण) 2. 29. 15; lusting after
the wives of their teachers, they follow
the laws of animals and are therefore as
good as born animals (गुरुदारप्रसक्तेषु
तिर्यग्योनिगतेषु च।पशुधर्मिषु …
म्लेच्छेषु) 1. 79. 13; their heads were
shaven, or half shaven, or they wore
twisted hair; their faces were bearded
(मुण्डार्धमुण्डजटिलान् … जटिलाननान्)
7. 68. 44; they had queer appearances
(नानाविकृतदर्शन) 7. 68. 37; Mlecchas
were born in sinful countries and were igno-
rant of धर्मस् (पापदेशोद्भवा म्लेच्छा
धर्माणाम् अविचक्षणाः) 8. 27. 91; they
lost knowledge and higher knowledge and
hence behaved as they liked (प्रनष्टज्ञान-
विज्ञानाः स्वच्छन्दाचारचेष्टिताः) 12. 181.
18; Rākṣasa Kalmāṣapāda told a certain
king that Mlecchas were the dirt of human
beings and Mauṣṭikas were the dirt of
Mlecchas (मानुषाणां मलं म्लेच्छा
म्लेच्छानां मौष्टिका मलम्) 8. 30. 70;
all varṇas including Mlecchas observe fast
(सर्वेषाम् एव वर्णानां म्लेच्छानां च … ।
उपवासे मतिर् … ) 13. 109. 1; they did not
deserve to be associated with (असंवासाः)
13. 112. 108; Mlecchas understood only
their own conventions (म्लेच्छाः स्वसंज्ञा-
नियताः) 8. 30. 80 (Nī., however, on Bom.
Ed. 8. 45. 36: (स्वससंज्ञायां स्वीयैः
कृतो यो धर्मसङ्केतस् तत्रैव नियताः
वैदिकं धर्मं न मानयन्तीत्य् अर्थः);
When the Pāṇḍavas left for Vāraṇāvata
Vidura spoke to Yudhiṣṭhira in the speech
of Mlecchas (unintelligible to others)
(उक्तो म्लेच्छवाचासि पाण्डव) 1. 135. 6;
(2) Mleccha warriors: Wore different kinds
of dresses (नानावेषधर) 7. 68. 38; they
were brave (शूर) 8. 31. 22, strong (बलिन्),
furious (संरम्भिन्), fond of battles
(युद्धशौण्ड) and firm-fisted (दृब्ध-
पाणि) 8. 51. 19; 7. 87. 17; skilled in fighting
battles (युद्धविशारद) 7. 103. 22; they
did not turn their backs to the enemies
(अनिवर्तिन्) 7. 98. 23; fought heroically with
various kinds of weapons (नानायुधवीर्य-
वन्त्) 5. 22. 21; (नानाशस्त्रौघसंवृत)
7. 68. 38; (विविधायुधपाणि) 7. 95. 13;
they were skilled in fighting while riding
elephants (गजयोधिन्, गजयुद्धेषु
कुशलाः) 8. 17. 2-3; their fights from ele-
phant-backs often mentioned 7. 68. 37,
40, 46 (also horses); 7. 87. 16-18; 8. 31.
22; their elephant-force known as अञ्जनक;
the elephants never turned back once they
were goaded to attack the enemies; they
preferred death to defeat (यद् एतत् कुञ्ज-
रानीकं साहस्रम् अनुपश्यसि।कुलम्
अञ्जनकं नाम … ; नैते जातु निवर्तेरन्
प्रेषिता हस्तिसादिभिः।अन्यत्र हि वधाद्
एषां नास्ति राजन् पराजयः) 7. 87. 16-17;
(3) Mleccha Kings: Acted as their teachers
(म्लेच्छाचार्याश् च राजानः) 12. 4. 8 (cf. S.
B. Belvalkar's note on this stanza in Vol.
13, p. 638. 1: “Mleccha kings of the west
were also the आचार्यस् or the spiritual heads
of their domain”).
E. Epic events:
(1) Duḥṣanta ruled over the entire earth
including the countries of the Mlecchas
and Āṭavikas (आ म्लेच्छाटविकान् सर्वान्)
1. 62. 5; (2) Bhīma in his expedition
to the east before the Rājasūya (ययौ
प्राचीं दिशं प्रति 2. 26. 1, 7; 2. 23. 9)
defeated Mleccha hordes who lived on the
islands of the eastern ocean (ये च सागर-
वासिनः।सर्वान् म्लेच्छगनांश् चैव
विजिग्ये) 2. 27. 23; he made their kings
pay tribute in the form of jewels and many
other precious articles including gold,
silver etc. (स सर्वान् म्लेच्छनृपतीन् सागर-
द्वीपवासिनः।करम् आहारयाम् आस रत्नान्त्
विविधानि च) 2. 27. 25-26; Sahadeva in
his expedition to the south (प्रययौ
दक्षिणां दिशम् 2. 28. 1; 2. 23. 9) brought
under control Mleccha kings living in
islands and made them pay tribute for the
Rājasūya (सागरद्वीपवासांश् च नृपतीन्
म्लेच्छयोनिजान्; करदान् पार्थिवान् कृत्वा)
2. 28. 44, 54; Nakula in his expedition to
the west (निर्याय खाण्डवप्रस्थात् प्रती-
चीम् अभितो दिशम् 2. 29. 2; 2. 23. 10)
brought under control Mlecchas living
along the western ocean (ततः सागरकुक्षि-
स्थान् म्लेच्छान्) 2. 29. 15; 5. 49. 26; Mle-
cchas were among those who made a crowd
at the Rājasūya (सर्वे म्लेच्छाः … ।पर्-
यस्त इव लोको ऽयं युधिष्ठिरनिवेशने)
2. 48. 33; Kṛṣṇa saw Mlecchas among
those who worked as attendants at the
Rājasūya (अहम् अद्राक्षं यज्ञे ते परि-
वेषकान्) 3. 48. 19; (3) Pāṇḍavas on
their way to Viśālā Badarī saw countries
inhabited by hordes of Mlecchas (देशान्
म्लेच्छगणाकीर्णान्) 3. 145. 12; (4) Some
Mlecchas had joined the army of Pāṇḍavas
(पाण्डवार्थे निविष्टाः) 5. 22. 21; others
had joined the army of Duryodhana
(राजचमूं समेताम्। … म्लेच्छैः) 5.
158. 19-20; (5) Mlecchas and Āryas, who
had gathered for war and who had seen
or heard about the conduct of Pāṇḍavas
wept with choked throats (म्लेच्छाश्
चार्याश् च … ददृशुः शुश्रुवुस् तदा।तद्
वृत्तं पाण्डुपुत्राणां रुरुदुस् ते सगद्-
गदाः॥) 6. 41. 103; (6) On the fourteenth
day, countless Mlecchas, along with the
elephants who carried them, were killed by
Arjuna with the माया of his अस्त्रस् (अस्त्र-
मायया); वडस्, कङ्कस् and wolves were
glad to drink their blood 7. 68. 37, 42,
44, 46; 7. 69. 30; (7) On the same day,
Sātyaki noticed the large army of Añjanaka
elephants ridden by Mlecchas 7. 87. 16-18;
having secured that large army of elephants
of Mlecchas, Duryodhana had felt contempt
for Pāṇḍavas (एतद् दुर्योधनो लब्ध्वा
समग्रं नागमण्डलम् … अवमन्यत
पाण्डवान्॥) 7. 87. 37-39; Sātyaki pointed
out to his charioteer the Mlecchas who,
riding chariots, horses and elephants, and
equipped with different weapons, desired to
fight with him 7. 95. 13-14; (8) Duḥśā-
sana, rebuked by Droṇa, attacked Sātyaki
along with a large army of Mlecchas (सै-
न्येन महता युक्तो म्लेच्छानाम् अनिवर्ति-
नाम्) 7. 98. 23; (9) The same day, Bhīma
defeated and passed beyond many hordes
of Mlecchas in order to get near Arjuna
7. 103. 32; (10) On the fifteenth day,
Bhīma while scolding Droṇa mentioned
that he, like a Cāṇḍāla, had killed many
hordes of Mlecchas 7. 165. 30; (11) On
the sixteenth day, Mlecchas (8. 17. 9) riding
elephants fought a severe battle with
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and other Pāṇḍava promi-
nent warriors 8. 17. 1-28 (for details of
the battle see Mekala); (12) On the
seventeenth day, Mlecchas riding elephants
in rut, led by Aśvatthāman and others,
followed the chariot-army of Duryodhana
at the back of the Bārhaspatyavyūha (8.
31. 26) of Kauravas 8. 31. 19-20, 22; the
same day, Kṛṣṇa in order to encourage
Arjuna said that Mlecchas who had asso-
ciated themselves with Kurus in the interest
of Duryodhana could not be conquered
by any one else except him (म्लेच्छाश् च …
एते सुयोधनस्यार्थे संरब्धाः कुरुभिः
सह।न शक्या युधि निर्जेतुं त्वदन्येन
परंतप॥) 8. 51. 19-20; Mlecchas, riding
thirteen hundred elephants in rut, attacked,
as directed by Duryodhana, Arjuna from
one side (पार्श्वतः); they showered
Arjuna with कर्णिन्, नालीक, and नाराच
arrows as also with तोमरस्, प्रासस्, शक्तिस्,
कम्पनस् and भिण्डिपालस्; Arjuna cut off
the shower of their arrows and weapons
with भल्ल and अर्धचन्द्र arrows; he
killed their elephants with different kinds
of महाशरस्; the elephants began to run
in all directions 8. 59. 10-16; (13)
After the war was over, while Saṃjaya
was reporting events of the eighteenth
day to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the latter remembered
that once the whole earth, including
the Mlecchas and Āṭavikas was sustained
due to the graciousness of Duryodhana
(इयं च पृथिवी सर्वा सम्लेछाटविका … ।
प्रसादाद् ध्रियते यस्य) 9. 31. 3; later,
Saṃjaya in his account listed Mlecchas
among those who were killed in the great
war (म्लेच्छाश् च … निपातिताः) 9. 1. 26;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Duryodhana,
before the war, counted Mlecchas among
those who, in thousands, were ready
to fight and give up their lives for him;
it was with their support that he was
going to fight with Pāṇḍavas (म्लेच्छाश्
च बहुसाहश्राः … मदर्थम् उद्यताः
सर्वे प्राणांस् त्यक्त्वा रणे प्रभो॥) 9.
2. 18, 21-22; that they were killed by
thousands, was due to bad fate according
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (हता … म्लेच्छाश् च
बहुसाहस्रा किम् अन्यद् भागधेयतः।)
9. 2. 36; (14) Mlecchācāryas were
among those who attended the स्वयं-
वर of the Kaliṅga princess at Rājapura
12. 4. 8; (15) Arjuna in his wanderings
with the Aśvamedha horse had to fight
with Mlecchas who were formerly, in the
war, offended by him (म्लेच्छाश् चान्ये
बहुविधा पूर्वं विनिकृता रणे) 14,
72. 24; when the horse wandered along
the seacoast through Vaṅga, Puṇḍra and
Kerala countries, Arjuna defeated many
Mleccha armies many times (ततः समुद्र-
तीरेण वङ्गान् पुण्ड्रान् सकेरलान्॥तत्र
तत्र च भूरीणी म्लेच्छसैन्यान्य् अने-
कशः।विजिग्ये) 14. 83. 30; at the end of the
Aśvamedha sacrifice, the sacrificial priests
distributed a large quantity of gold among
the Brāhmaṇas; after that, what wealth
(gold) remained that was taken away
over a long period by Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas,
Śūdras and Mleccha tribes (अनन्तरं
ब्राह्मणेभ्यः क्षत्रिया जह्रिरे वसु।
तथा विट्शूद्रसंघाश् च तथान्ये म्ले-
च्छजातयः।कालेन महता जह्रुस् तत्
सुवर्णम् ततस् ततः॥) 14. 91. 25; (16)
On Arjuna's way from Dvārakā to Hāstina-
pura, Mlecchas abducted Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka women 16. 8. 61.
F. Past
events: (1) Demons Sunda and Upasunda
conquered all Mleccha tribes living in the
ocean (समुद्रवासिनः सर्वान् म्लेच्छ-
जातीन् विजिग्यतुः) 1. 202. 8; (2) Damayantī,
forsaken by Nala, entered a forest inhabited
by Mlecchas and thieves (म्लेच्छतस्कर-
सेवितम्) 3. 61. 2; (3) Indra taught king
Māndhātṛ the duties of Dasyus which term
included Mlecchas 12. 65. 14, 17-22; (4)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira a story related
to Mlecchas who lived in the north (the
term Dasyu is used in the story for
Mlecchas) 12. 162. 28 ff.; (5) Yayāti
cursed his son Turvasu to the effect that
he would be born among the Mlecchas
(म्लेच्छेषु प्रभविष्यसि) 1. 79. 13.
G.
Future event: Mārkaṇḍeya foretold that
in the Kali age (कलौ युगे 3. 186. 27)
there would be many Mleccha kings on
this earth; they would be sinful, given to
lies and rule the world the wrong way
(बहवो म्लेच्छराजानः पृथिव्यां … ।
मिथ्यानुशासिनः पापा मृषावादपराय-
णाः) 3. 186. 29; when the end of the aeon
will have arrived (युगान्ते समनुप्राप्ते
3. 186. 33; युगान्ते पर्युपस्थिते 3. 188.
19, 43-44. 47, 54, 76, 81-83; युगान्ते 3.

at the end of the aeon described in 3. 186.
24-57; 3. 188. 14-85; A Brāhmaṇa named
Kalki Viṣṇuyaśas would be born in the
Sambhala town; he would become a
sovereign king (राजा चक्रवर्ती), destroy
all the Mleccha hordes, and give a turn
to the Yuga (युगस्य परिवर्तकः। …

यदु
Yadu, Yādava m. (pl.): Name of
a people, often identified with Vṛṣṇis so
that their accounts get mixed up; some-
times mentioned also along with Andhakas
and Bhojas.
A. Origin: Yādavas were born in
the line of Yadu, son of Yayāti (यदोस्
तु यादवा जाताः) 1. 80. 26; (यदुश् च …
यादवानां कुलकरो … ) 5. 147. 6-7; the
lineage of Yadus is traced back to Viva-
svant (पुत्रा विवस्वतः सर्वे … तेभ्यो
ऽयं कुरुवंशश् च यदूनां भरतस्य
च) 1. 1. 41, 44; Other accounts: (1)
Baladeva and Kṛṣṇa were born from the
two hair-one white and the other black-
plucked by Hari and which entered Rohiṇī
and Devakī of the lineage of Yadus;
(स चापि केशौ हरिर् उद्बबर्ह शुक्लम्
एकम् अपरं चापि कृष्णम्।तौ चापि
केशौ विशतां यदूनां कुले स्त्रियौ
रोहिणीं देवकीं च।तयोर् एको बलदेवो
बभूव कृष्णो द्वितीयः) 1. 189. 31;
(2) Nārāyaṇa was born on this earth
(as Kṛṣṇa) in the house of Yadus and
in the lineage of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis
( … नारायणः … अजायत यदुक्षये।क्षिताव्-
अन्धकवृष्णीनां वंशे) 2. 33. 16-17
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 2. 36. 16; यदुक्षये
यदुगृहे).
B. Glorification of the family
of Yadus and of their narrative: Kings born
in the lineage of Yadus were incarnations
of gods (इति देवासुराणां ते … अंशावतर-
णं राजन् … कीर्तितम्॥ … महात्मानो
यदूनां च ये जाता विपुले कुले) 1. 61.
99-100, also cf. 92; the narrative of the
family of Yādavas, as also of Pauravas
and Bhāratas, is holy, leads to well-being,
brings wealth, fame and long life (यादवा-
नाम् इमं वंशं … पुण्यं स्वस्त्यय-
नं महत्।धन्यं यशस्यम् आयुष्यं … )
1. 70. 2.
C. Description: Of unlimited
energy (अमितौजस्) 16. 9. 12; spirited, of
true valour, very strong; led by Kṛṣṇa, they
all were like Indra and got all enjoyments
(कृष्णप्रणीताः सर्व एवेन्द्रकल्पाः।
मनस्विनः सत्यपराक्रमाश् च।महा-
बला यादवा भोगवन्तः॥) 5. 28. 12 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 28. 12; कृष्णप्रणीताः
कृष्णेनल्व नीतिपथं नीताः); their kings
were magnanimous (महात्मन्) 1. 61. 100.
D. Epic events: (1) Yādavas, Andhakas
and Bhojas had abandoned Kaṃsa in
the interest of the family; after he was
killed by Kṛṣṇa, all his kinsmen lived
happily for a hundred years (अन्धका
यादवा भोजाः समेताः कंसम् अत्यजन्। …
एवं ते ज्ञातयः सर्वे मोदमानाः शतं
समाः॥) 2. 55. 6-7; कंसम् एकं परि-
त्यज्य कुलार्थे सर्वयादवाः।संभूय
सुखम् एधन्ते … अन्धकवृष्णयः॥)
5. 126. 39; (2) Karṇa advised Duryo-
dhana to use force against Pāṇḍavas before
Kṛṣṇa came with the army of Yādavas to
help them (कर्षन् यादववाहिनीम्) 1. 194.
15; (3) The messenger sent by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira to Kṛṣṇa reached the country of
Yādavas and saw him in Dvārakā (प्राप्य

he remembered again and again the des-
truction of Yadus of unlimited energy and
of Kṛṣṇa (पुनः पुनर् न मृश्यामि विनाशम्
अमितौजसाम्।चिन्तयानो यदूनां च
कृष्णस्य च … ) 16. 9. 12 (the event of
Arjuna's seeing the great destruction of
Yadu heroes in a drinking bout is mention-
ed earlier in the summary of Mausala-
parvan in 1. 2. 224 (ददर्श यदुवीराणाम्
आपाने वैशसं महत्; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 2.
355: आपाने सुरापानस्थाने); (16) When
Pāṇḍavas started on their Great Journey
(महाप्रस्थान) Yudhiṣṭhira made Vajra,
who survived the destruction of Yadus,

Sātyaki to fight with him; but Sātyaki
was going to kill them all, foot-soldiers
and those driving in chariots or riding
elephants along with their horses and ele-
phants, and break their chariots, (यत्रैते
सतनुत्राणाः सुयोधनपुरोगमाः। …
शरबाणासनधरा यवनाश् च प्रहारिणः)
7. 95. 11-14; when Sātyaki reached the
Yavanas, many of them, quick in action
(लघुहस्ताश् च) showered arrows on
him; Sātyaki cut off their arrows and
missiles; he also cut off their arms and
heads; his arrows pierced through their
steel armours (शैक्यायसानि वर्माणि)
and went through their bodies; dead,
they fell down on the ground by hundreds

seven or even eight (पञ्च षट् सप्त
चाष्टौ च) of them at a time with his
arrows 7. 95. 37; thus Sātyaki routed
(विद्राव्य) the large army of Yavanas and
proceeded towards Arjuna 7. 95. 45; 7. 96.
1; at the instance of Duryodhana and led
by him Yavanas returned to fight once
again with Sātyaki and attacked him (ते
पुनः संन्यवर्तन्त … ।परां युद्धे
मतिं कृत्वा पुत्रस्य तव शासनात्॥) 7.
97. 12-14; (10) On the seventeenth day
Yavanas, in chariots and on horse-backs
and their footsoldiers, stood at the extreme
end of left side of the Bārhaspatyavyūha
(8. 31. 26) of Kauravas and, as directed
by Karṇa, challenged Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa
(वामं पार्श्वम् अपालयन्। … तेषां प्रप-
क्षः … शकाश् च यवनैः सह॥निदेशात्
सूतपुत्रस्य सरथाः साश्वपत्तयः।आह्व-
यन्तो ऽर्जुनं तस्थुः केशवं च … ॥) 8.
31. 14-16; at the instance of Śakuni, three
thousand Yavanas, honoured by the brave,
holding शक्तिस्, ऋष्टिस्, and प्रासस् in their
hands attacked Bhīma; when beaten and
slashed by Bhīma with sword, they raised
a loud roar (ताडितानां च सर्वशः।
असिभिश् छिद्यमानानाम्) 8. 35. 37; Arjuna
attacked the extreme end (of the left side
of) the व्यूह (8. 40. 99-100, 110) and
fought with Kāmbojas, Yavanas and Śakas
who rode horses; they were all smeared
with blood (यवनैः … ।शोनिताक्तैस् तदा
रक्तं सर्वम् आसीद् … ) 8. 40. 108; Kṛṣṇa
told Arjuna that no one else but he
(Arjuna) could conquer Yavanas and others
who had joined hands with Kauravas for
the sake of Duryodhana (एते दुर्योधन-
स्यार्थे संरब्धाः कुरुभिः सह।न
शक्या युधि निर्जेतुं त्वदन्येन परं-
तप॥) 8. 51. 18, 20; Yavanas riding horses
attacked Arjuna to kill him; Arjuna cut
off their arms, holding excellent weapons,
and their heads with क्षुर arrows (यव-
नाश् च सादिनः। … क्षुरैर् न्यकृन्तंस्
त्वरिताः शिरांसि च) 8. 64. 16-17; (11)
On the eighteenth day, Kṛpa accompanied
by Śakas and Yavanas stood on the right
side (दक्षिणे पार्श्वे) of the Sarvato-
bhadravyūha (9. 7. 19) of Kauravas 9. 7.
24; (12) On the nineteenth day, in the
morning (पूर्वाह्णसमये 9. 1. 14), Saṃ-
jaya returned from the camp and while
reporting to Dhṛtarāṣṭra about the war
mentioned that all Yavanas were killed 9.
1. 26; hearing that, Dhṛtarāṣṭra remem-
bered that Yavanas were ready to fight
for him unmindful of their death (मदर्-
थम् उद्यताः सर्वे प्राणांस् त्यक्त्वा
रणे … ) 9. 2. 18. 21.
E. Past event:
King Māndhātṛ once asked Indra the
धर्म of people like Yavanas and how
they should be controlled by kings like
him (कथं धर्मं चरेयुस् ते … मद्-
विधैश् च कथं स्थाप्याः) 12. 65. 13, 15;
Indra thereupon told him the duties of all
Dasyus (the term included Yavanas) 12.
65. 17-22.
F. Future event: Yavanas
listed among the Mleccha kings who in
the Kali age would rule the earth the
wrong way, would be sinful, and given to
telling lies (कलौ युगे … बहवो म्लेच्छ-
राजानः प्रिथिव्यां … मिथ्यानुशासिनः
पापा मृषावादपरायणाः॥ … यवनाश् च
नराधिपाः) 3. 186. 27, 29-30.

यायावर
Yāyāvara m. (pl.): Name of a group
(गण) of ऋषिस्।
A. Qualities: Of strict vows (सं-
शितव्रत) 1. 13. 14; 1. 41. 16; they practised
severe austerities and were expert knowers
of धर्म for they were the direct seers
of धर्म, hence characterized as ऋषिस्
( … प्रत्यक्सधर्माणस् तथा यायावरा
गणाः।ऋषीणाम् उग्रतपसाम् धर्म-
नैपुणदर्शिनाम्॥) 12. 236 19 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 12. 244. 19: प्रत्यक्षः
धर्मो धर्मफलं सत्यसङ्कल्पत्वा-
दिकं येषां ते प्रत्यक्षधर्माणः).
B. Their history: (1) Yāyāvaras were the
forefathers of Jaratkāru; he once saw
them hanging with their heads down and
holding on to a bunch of grass; a mouse
residing in a hole was slowly eating up
that bunch of grass; Jaratkāru addressed
them; he pitied their plight for they were
without food, were lean, pitiable, affli-
cted and waiting for help; he showed his
readiness to help them by offering them
the fourth, the third, the half, of his
austerities, or even all of them; Yāyāvaras
told him that they were falling down in
the impure hell because of the non-
continuation of their line (संतान-
प्रक्षय); his austerities would not
help them; they told him they were sages
known as Yāyāvaras, they had fallen
down from the holy world due to the
discontinuation of their line (संतान-
प्रक्षय); their austerities had come to an
end; there was no one to continue their line;
the only one, named Jaratkāru, was as good
as nothing for this purpose; he was versed
in the Vedas but had not married and had
no progeny; hence they were hanging head
down in the ditch; if ever the person to
whom they were addressing met Jaratkāru
he should tell him their plight, ask him to
marry and beget progeny; the bunch of
grass to which they were clinging was
their only support; if they fell down along
with their ancestors, Jaratkāru too would
fall down into the hell; neither austerities,
nor sacrifices, nor any thing else was equal
to a child 1. 41. 3-30; 1. 13. 10-30; Jarat-
kāru then disclosed his identity to Yāyā-
varas and asked them to punish him; they
told him that fortunately he had come
there and asked him the reason of his not
marrying; Jaratkāru told them that by ob-
serving celibacy he wanted to take his body
to the next world (ऊर्ध्वरेताः शरीरं वै
प्रापयेयम् अमुत्र वै); however now that
he had seen their plight he had decided to
marry provided he found a maiden having
his name and also if he was not required to
support her (सनाम्नीं यद्य् अहं कन्याम्
उपलप्स्ये कदाचन … न भरेयं च
याम् अहम्); Jaratkāru did not get a
maiden since he was old; dejected he went
to the forest and addressed all beings,
moving and not moving, and even those
concealed, telling them that Yāyāvaras had
asked him to marry and so he requested
them to give him a maiden who bore his
name and whom he was not required to
support 1. 42. 1-15; when Jaratkāru's
conditions were fulfilled, he married; when
Āstīka was born, he saved Yāyāvaras and
took off great burden of his ancestors;
Jaratkāru went to heaven, along with his
ancestors (पितॄंश् च तारयाम् आस संतत्या
तपसा तथा। … अपहृत्य गुरुं भारम्
पितॄणां … ।जरत्कारुर् गतः स्वर्गं
सहितः स्वैः पितामहैः॥) 1. 13. 41-46;

विदेह
Videha1 m. (pl.): Name of a Jana-
pada and its people; once named (perhaps
for metre) Videhaka 6. 10. 44.
A. Location: Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of Bhāratavarṣa (अत
ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध) 6. 10. 37, 5;
(विदेहका मागधाश् च) 6. 10. 44 (here
Videhakas are listed along with Māgadhas
as apposed to Videhas2 listed by Saṃjaya
along with Kirātas, Barbaras and others);
the Janapada lay in the east beyond Pāñ-
cālas and the river Gaṇḍakī 2. 26. 3-4 (see
Epic event No. 2 below); Vātikaṣaṇḍa (?)
lay to the north of Videhas (एष वातिक-
षण्डो वै … विदेहान् उत्तरं च यः) 3.
130. 13; Videhas lived in Mithilā (see
Epic event No. 1 below) 1. 105. 11.
B.
Description of its warriors and people:
Strong (बलवन्त्) 6. 112. 107; great
chariot-fighters (महारथ) 6. 112. 107,
111; very difficult to be conquered in
battle (संख्ये सुदुर्जयाः) 8. 57. 31; the
Videha country was inhabited by very
prosperous people (समृद्धजनसेवित)
12. 312. 22.
C. Epic events: (1) In
Pāṇḍu's conquest of the earth which he
undertook after his marriage, he went
to Mithilā and defeated Videhas in
battle (जिगीषमाणो वसुधां … पाण्डुना
मिथिलां गत्वा विदेहाः समरे जिताः)
1. 105. 7, 11; (2) Bhīmasena, in his
expedition to the east (ययौ प्राचीं
दिशं प्रति 2. 26. 1; 2. 23. 9) went beyond
Pāñcālas and the river Gaṇḍakī and defeat-
ed Videhas 2. 26. 3-4; (3) On the tenth
day of the war, Videha warriors (on the
side of Kauravas) as directed by Duryo-
dhana who assured them the protection
of Bhīṣma, attacked Arjuna; Arjuna burnt
them and their armies with his heavenly
missiles (दिव्यान्य् अस्त्राणि संचिन्त्य प्र-
संधाय); afflicted by arrows and with
their chariots and banners broken they
did not attack Arjuna (शरार्ता …
विप्रकीर्णरथध्वजाः। … नाभ्यवर्तन्त
 … वानरध्वजम्) 6. 112. 102, 105, 108,
110-112, 114; on the same day, in the
meeting between Bhīṣma and Karṇa after
the former's downfall, Bhīṣma reminded
Karṇa in order to encourage him that he
had formerly defeated Videhas (7. 4. 5);
on the seventeenth day, Śalya too, in order
to encourage Karṇa reminded him that
he had once with great courage defeated
Videhas (वैदेहा° … यया धृत्या जिताः सं-
ख्ये सुदुर्जयाः) 8. 57. 31; later Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra while lamenting over the death of
Karṇa remembered that Karṇa had defeated
Videhas and made them pay tribute (विदे-
हांश् च … ।यो जित्वा समरे वीरश् चक्रे
बलिभृतः पुरा॥) 8. 5. 19-20 (reference
in all three cases to Karṇa's दिग्विजय
before the Vaiṣṇavayajña of Duryodhana
3. 241. 29, 32; 3. App. 24-42 (मिथिलान्));
(4) On the seventeenth day, at night
(निशि 8. 1. 25), Saṃjaya in his first brief
account of the death of Karṇa, mentioned
that Karṇa killed many Videhas (on the
side of Pāṇḍavas) in the presence of all
Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas (स सृञ्जयानां
सर्वेषां पाञ्चालानां च पश्यताम् …
विदेहानाम् अकरोत् कदनं महत्॥) 8. 2.
18.
D. Past events: (1) King Janaka
gave his son the kingdom of Videha
and himself lived the life of a mendicant
(विदेहराज्यं तथा प्रतिष्ठाप्य सुतस्य
वै) 12. 306. 94; (2) Sulabhā went to
the capital town of Videhas (विदेहानां
पुरीं … ) 12. 308. 11; (3) Śuka, as
instructed by Vyāsa, reached the country
of Videhas which was protected by Janaka
(विदेहान् आससाद ह।रक्षितान् धर्मराजेन
जनकेन) 12. 312. 6, 19; Śuka entered the
country of Videhas and reached the garden
in Mithilā (स विदेहान् अतिक्रम्य … मिथि-
लोपवनं रम्यं आससाद) 12. 312. 22.
E. Some kings referred to as:
A. the
king of Videhas: (a) विदेहराज: (1)
Janaka, father of Sītā 3. 132. 4; 3. 258. 9;
(2) Janaka, the philosopher 12. 18. 3; 12.
28. 57; 12. 171. 55; 12. 268. 3; 12. 286. 41;

ing to Videha: (a) वैदेह: (1) Karāla-
janaka 12. 296. 37 (cf. 12. 291. 7-8); (2)
Janaka, the philosopher 12. 28. 3; 12. 285.
16; 12. 286. 17; 12. 307. 4, 6; (3) Nimi 12.
226. 26; (4) A king, not named 12. 106. 6;

265. 17-18, 30; 3. 266. 23, 35, 55, 66; 3.
273. 26; 3. 275. 102, 21, 56, 63; 3. 276. 10;
4. 20. 9; (3) A princess, not named,
married to Śatānīka 1. 90. 95.

विदेह
Videha2 m. (pl.): Name of a Janapada.
A. Location: Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of Bhāratavarṣa (अत
ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध) 6. 10. 37, 5;
(किराता बर्बराः सिद्धा विदेहास् ताम्रलिङ्ग-
काः) 6. 10. 55 (these Videhas seem to be
different from Videhas1 since these are listed
along with Kirātas and others).
B.
Description: Karṇa mentioned to Śalya
of a certain Brāhmaṇa who in the Kuru
assembly, equated Videhas with Āraṭṭas
(Bāhlīkas) and described them as non-
sacrificers, those who had lost their धर्म
and hence whose country should not be
visited; this description seems to apply to
these Videhas2 and not to Videha1 above
(आरट्टा नाम ते देशा नष्टधर्मान् न तान्
व्रजेत्।व्रात्यानां दासमी यानां विदेहानाम्
अयज्वनाम्) 8. 30. 36.

विन्ध्यपुलक
Vindhyapulaka m. (pl.): Name of a
Janapada.
Listed by Saṃjaya among the southern
Janapadas (also called Deśas 6. 10. 68)
of the Bhāratavarṣa (अथापरे जनपदा
दक्षिणा … ) 6. 10. 56, 5; (तथैव विन्ध्य-
पुलकाः पुलिन्दाः … ) 6. 10. 60.

वीतहव्य
Vītahavya: See Vaitahavya.

वीरक
Vīraka m. (pl.): Name of a people.
According to a Brāhmaṇa reporting to
the Kuru assembly, a certain Rākṣasī
described Vīrakas as those who followed
bad धर्म and therefore should be com-
pletely avoided (कर्कोटकान् वीरकांश् च
दुर्धर्मांश् च विवर्जयेत्) 8. 30. 41,
45-46.

वृष्णि
Vṛṣṇi m. (pl.): Name of a people,
occasionally referred to as Vārṣṇeyas; often
mentioned along with Andhakas and some-
times also with Bhojas.
A. Location: They lived in the city
Dvārakā; the city is referred to as वृष्णिपुर
3. 21. 4; 3. 180. 25; वृष्ण्यन्धकपुर
3. 16. 19 (see below Epic events No. 17).
B. Origin: The origin of the Vṛṣṇi race
is sought in the extensive race of Prajāpati
known as the progeny of Śaśabindu (प्रजाम्
आचक्षते विप्राः पौराणीं शाशबिन्दवीम्।
स वृष्णिवंशप्रभवो महावंशः प्रजा-
पतेः॥) 12. 201. 13 (Comm. Arjunamiśra
on 12. 201. 11: शशबिन्दुः वृष्णीनां
पूर्वजः। सो ऽपि प्रजापतिः); see Editor's
note, Cr. edn. Vol. 16, p. 2166).
C.
Greatness: While narrating the descent of
the first generations (आदिवंशावतार),
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that the all-
pervading Puruṣa took birth (as Kṛṣṇa)
among the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas for fur-
thering the cause of धर्म (पुरुषः स
विभुः … ।धर्मसंवर्धनार्थाय प्र-
जज्ञे ऽन्धकवृष्णिषु) 1. 57. 87; Nārāyaṇa
was born as Kṛṣṇa in the family of Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas 2. 33. 17; 2. 34. 15.
D.
Description and characteristics: Of good
nature (सुमनस्) 5. 84. 4; very fortunate
(सुमहाभाग) 12. 82. 8; having all enjoy-
ments (भोगवन्त्) 5. 28. 12; prosperous
(स्फीत) 5. 84. 3; prosperous because they
were always active (नित्योत्थानेन सं-
पन्नाः) 12. 82. 8; magnanimous (महात्-
मन्) 1. 213. 53; 3. 119. 2; 16. 9. 26;
of great lustre (सुमहौजस्) 1. 211. 5;
spirited (मनस्विन्) 5. 28. 12; brave (शूर)
and proud like lion (सिंहदर्प) 16.
9. 9; heroic (वीर, वीर्यवन्त्) 2. 13. 59;
excellent heroes (उत्तमवीर्य) 1. 213. 55:
strong, very strong (बलिन्) 2. 17. 27;
(महाबल) 2. 13. 59; 5. 28 12; 16. 9. 9;
(बलवन्त्) 12. 82. 8; powerful (सामर्थ्य-
वन्त्) 2. 13. 53; great archers (महेष्वास)
2. 72. 29; 3. 48. 6; tigers among men
(पुरुषव्याघ्र) 1. 212. 14; immensely
powerful like tigers (व्याघ्रैर् इव बलो-
त्कटैः) 5. 154. 17; proficient in all
शास्त्रस् (सर्वशास्त्रविशारद) 3. 119. 2;
difficult to be attacked (दुर्धर्ष) 2. 4.
26; (दुरासद) 12. 82. 8; of ture valour
(सत्यपराक्रम) 5. 28. 12; bringing toge-
ther people (?) (लोकसंहनन) 2. 13. 59;
having long arms, like iron bars (बाहुशालिन्,
परिघबाहु) 16. 9. 10-11; their arms were
capable of resisting maces, iron bars and
शक्तिस् (गदापरिघशक्तीनां सहाः) 16.
9. 10; they were like Indra (इन्द्रकल्प)
5. 28. 12; like gods (देवरूपिन्) 2. 4. 26;
attached to Kṛṣṇa (त्वय्य् आसक्ताः) 12. 82.
29; Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas followed the
advice of Kṛṣṇa (यस्य प्रज्ञाम् उपासते)
5. 84. 4; following Kṛṣṇa's advice, Vārṣṇe-
yas and Bhojas restrained their enemies and
gave delight to friends (वार्ष्णेयभोजाः
 … उपासीना वासुदेवस्य बुद्धिं निगृह्य
शत्रून् सुहृदो नन्दयन्ति) 5. 28. 11; no one
in the past was or in the future would be
equal to Vṛṣṇis in strength; they did not
disregard kinsmen, were obedient to elders,
gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Rākṣa-
sas; men were unable to defeat Vṛṣṇi
warriors in battles: they did not rob Brāh-
maṇas, teachers, kinsmen of their wealth;
on the other hand, if any one of them was
in difficulty they protected him; they were
wealthy, but were not arrogant; truthful,
they were devoted to Brāhmaṇas; they did
not underrate the strong ones, they uplifted
the weak ones; they worshipped gods, were
controlled and generous, but not given to
boasting; due to these virtues Vṛṣṇi warriors
were not attacked; one might carry moun-
tain Meru, cross the ocean, but not succeed
if he dared attack Vṛṣṇi warriors (न
तुल्यं … भूतं भव्यं भविष्यच् च
बलेन; समर्थान् नावमन्यन्ते दीनान्
अभ्युद्धरन्ति च; तेन वृष्णिप्रवीराणां
चक्रं न प्रतिहन्यते; Nī. on Bom. Ed.
7. 144. 28: चक्रं प्रतापः 7. 119. 22-27
(this description of Vṛṣṇis immediately
follows that of the Sātvatas (7. 119. 20-21)
which is indicative of the identity between
the two); Bhūriśravas deriding Sātyaki
ridiculed Vṛṣṇis as व्रात्यस्, not distin-
guishing between good and evil acts, and
despicable by very nature (व्रात्याः सं-
श्लिष्तकर्माणः प्रकृत्यैव विगर्हिताः)
7. 118. 15.
E. Epic events: (1) The
Vṛṣṇis went to the forest to meet Pāṇḍavas
(वृष्णीनाम् आगमो यत्र)—a reference to
a later epic event (see No. 15 below) in the
summary of the contents of the Āraṇyaka-
parvan (given in the sub-parvan पर्वसं-
ग्रह) 1. 2. 106; (2) Yudhiṣṭhira heard
from Nārada the massive mutual destruc-
tion of the Vṛṣṇis—a reference to a later
event (see below No. 65) in the summary
of the contents of the Āśramavāsikaparvan
1. 2. 217 (actually this event does not
form part of the Āśramavāsikaparvan but
of the Mausalaparvan and Yudhiṣṭhira
did not get the news from Nārada but
from Dāruka (cf. 16. 1. 7; 16. 6. 11);
Arjuna seeing Dvārakā without Vṛṣṇis was
dejected 1. 2. 223; he performed the funeral
rites of Rāma, Kṛṣṇa and other Vṛṣṇi-chiefs
(वृष्णीनां च प्रधानतः); he felt sad on
account of the abduction of Vṛṣṇi women
(नाशं वृष्णिकलत्राणाम्) 1. 2. 227—all
three events are references given in the
summary of the Mausalaparvan to later epic
events (see below Epic events Nos. 70-75);
(3) Vṛṣṇis learnt the science of archery
(धनुर्वेद) from Kṛpa 1. 120. 21; Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas approached Droṇa to learn
the अस्त्रस् (अस्त्रार्थे … वृष्णयश् चान्धकाश्
चैव) 1. 122. 46; (4) Vṛṣṇi chiefs attend-
ed the स्वयंवर of Draupadī 1. 177. 18;
as advised by Kṛṣṇa they watched the pro-
ceedings of the स्वयंवर 1. 178. 8;
(5) Bhoja, Vṛṣṇi, and Andhaka women
gathered to see Arjuna when he arrived at
Dvārakā; Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
honoured and greeted Arjuna; he paid his
respects to the deserving among them;
Vṛṣṇis, along with Bhojas and Andhakas
celebrated a grand festival in honour of
the Raivataka mountain; in that festival,
Vṛṣṇis and others gave gifts to thousands
of Brāhmaṇas; thousands of illustrious
youths of Vṛṣṇis put on ornaments and
moved about riding vehicles decorated with
gold; their wives and followers accompani-
ed them 1. 211. 1-2, 5-6; (6) On hearing
the sound of the drum sounded by the
guardian of the Sabhā, agitated Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, leaving aside food and drink,
assembled by hundreds in the Sabhā and
took their seats on the सिंहासनस्; the
Sabhāpāla told them that Arjuna had ab-
ducted Subhadrā; on hearing it they leaped
up from their seats and asked their chari-
oteers to yoke the chariots and bring their
weapons, bows and armours; others brought
forth their gold-decked horses; when all
these arrangements were being done there
arose a confused sound of the Vṛṣṇi
heroes 1. 212. 12-19; Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas got ready to follow Balarāma
when he announced his intention to fight
with Arjuna (अन्वपद्यन्त ते सर्वे भोज-
वृष्ण्यन्धकास् तदा) 1. 212. 31-32; Vṛṣṇis
made their intention to attack Arjuna
known several times; but when Kṛṣṇa told
them that Arjuna had done the right thing,
they were pacified 1. 213. 2-11; Kṛṣṇa with
Vṛṣṇis and others went to the Khāṇḍava-
prastha to attend the marriage of Subhadrā
with Arjuna; they took with them large
number of nuptial gifts (हरणं बहु);
they were received by Nakula and Saha-
deva; the illustrious Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णिचक्रं
समृद्धिमत्) entered Khāṇḍavaprastha;
Yudhiṣṭhira received the seniors among
Vṛṣṇis with honours according to the rules
and following the actual practice (?) (प्रति-
जग्राह सत्कारैर् यथाविधि यथोपगम्);
he honoured some Vṛṣṇi-chiefs as elders,
some as friends; he greeted some with
affection and was himself greeted by some
(गुरुवत् पूजयाम् आस कांश्चित् कांश्चिद्
वयस्यवत्।कांश्चिद् अभ्यवदत् प्रेम्णा
कैश् चिद् अप्य् अभिवादितः॥) 1. 213. 23-24,
29, 31, 34, 38-39; after receiving their
gifts, Yudhiṣṭhira honoured the great
warriors of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्य्-
अन्धकमहारथान्); the best among the
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्यन्धकोत्त-
माः) lived happily with Kurus and enjoyed
with them great drinking bouts (महा-
पानैर् … विजह्रुः कुरुवृष्णयः); then,
after many days, the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
warriors (उत्तमवीर्यास् ते), led by Bala-
rāma, returned to Dvārakā taking with
them bright jewels given to them by
Kurus 1. 213. 52-56; (7) Vṛṣṇi princes
(वृष्णीनां … कुमारा … ) were among those
who waited on Dharmarāja in his Sabhā 2.
4. 26; (8) They were taught the science
of archery by Arjuna (कुमारा … वृष्णि-
नन्दनाः) 2. 4. 29; (9) Vṛṣṇis fled
from Mathurā and settled down at Kuśa-
sthalī in the west; they fortified the new
settlement in such a way as to make it
difficult to be captured even by gods; even
women could fight and hold it against
the attack (स्त्रियो ऽपि यस्यां युध्येयुः
किं पुनर् वृष्णिपुंगवाः 2. 13. 51);
Vṛṣṇis lived there without fear from any
quarter (अकुतोभयाः); although powerful,
they had allied themselves with Pāṇḍavas
because of their relationship (सामर्थ्य-
वन्तः सम्बन्धाद् भवन्तं समुपा-
श्रिताः); Cārudeṣṇa and all other Vṛṣṇi
heroes though free from grief, lived at
Kuśasthalī still remembering the Madhya-
deśa (where they formerly lived) (स्मरन्तो
मध्यमं देशं वृष्णिमध्ये गत-
व्यथाः) 2. 13. 53, 59; (10) Jarāsandha
was neglected by Vṛṣṇis, though strong,
out of considerations of policy (बलिभिः
 … वृष्णिभिश् च … नीतिहेतोर् उपेक्षितः) 2.
17. 27; (11) Vṛṣṇis arrived at Khāṇḍava-
prastha for the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira
2. 31. 16; (12) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
did not pay tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira for
Rājasūya because of their friendly relations
with Pāṇḍavas (सख्येनान्धकवृष्णयः)
2. 48. 42; however, Vārṣṇeyas are said to
have brought for Yudhiṣṭhira many kinds
of tribute (वार्ष्णेयान् हारहूणांश् च
 … बल्यर्थं ददतस् तस्मै नानारूपान्
अनेकशः) but were stopped at the gate 2.
47. 19-20, 25; the tribute is described in 2.
47. 21-25 (since Vārṣṇeyas are here listed
along with Cīnas, Hūṇas, Śakas, Oḍras,
forest-dwellers, and Hārahūṇas, are these
Vārṣṇeyas different from Vṛṣṇis who formed
a section of the Yādavas and did not pay
tribute ?): (13) Śiśupāla instigated the
kings assembled for the Rājasūya to fight
with Vṛṣṇis and Pāṇḍavas 2. 36. 14; (14)
Vidura warned Kauravas that Vṛṣṇis would
never forgive the hardship suffered by Drau-
padī in the Sabhā (तस्याः … परिक्लेशं
न क्षंस्यन्ते … ।वृष्णयो वा महेष्वासाः)
2. 72. 29; (15) Hearing that Pāṇḍavas
had gone into exile, Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas, and
Andhakas went to meet them in the
Dvaitavana (3. 12. 68); they sat around
Yudhiṣṭhira, blamed Kauravas and won-
dered what they could do (to help them)
3. 13. 1, 3-4; (16) Draupadī complained
to Kṛṣṇa that Kauravas had desired to
reduce her to the status of a दासी although
Vṛṣṇis were alive (दासीभावेन भोक्तुं
माम् ईषुस् ते मधुसूदन।जीवत्सु … अथ
वृष्णिषु) 3. 13. 56; 5. 80. 25; (17) When
Śālva attacked Dvārakā in the absence of
Kṛṣṇa, young Vṛṣṇi heroes fought with him
(बालकैर् वृष्णिपुंगवैः); Śālva killed
many of the excellent Vṛṣṇi heroes (वृष्णि-
प्रवीरांस् तान् बालान् हत्वा) 3. 15. 6-7;
during Śālva's attack on Dvārakā drinking
liquor was prohibited; Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas had to remain alert apprehending
Śālva might attack them when they were
drunk (प्रमत्तेष्व् अभिघातं हि कुर्यात्
 … इति कृत्वाप्रमत्तास् ते सर्वे वृष्ण्य्-
अन्धकाः स्थिताः॥) 3. 16. 12-13; it was
then ruled that no one in the town of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could leave or enter
the town without valid permit (न चामुद्रो
ऽभिनिर्याति न चामुद्रः प्रवेश्यते।वृष्ण्य-
न्धकपुरे) 3. 16. 19; when the youthful
Vṛṣṇi princes saw Śālva's army attacking
Dvārakā, they came out and fought with
the opponents (कुमारा वृष्णिनन्दनाः)
3. 17. 8; when Pradyumna swooned, the
army of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas raised a
cry of grief; when Pradyumna regained
consciousness he blamed his charioteer for
removing his chariot away from the battle-
field for that was not the battle-धर्म
of Vṛṣṇ warriors (नैष वृष्णिप्रवीराणाम्
आहवे धर्म उच्यते) 3. 19. 1-2, 5; he
told the charioteer that one who left the
battlefield was not born in the family of
Vṛṣṇis (न स वृष्णिकुले जातो यो वै त्यजति
संगरम्), nor he who killed one fallen
on the ground or who had surrendered,
or a woman, an old man or a child, or
one who was without a chariot, who was
shattered, and whose weapons were broken;
he reminded the charioteer that he (the
charioteer) knew what the धर्म of
Vṛṣṇis was in battles, and since he knew
the entire code of conduct of Vṛṣṇis en-
gaged in fighting he should not have taken
Pradyumna away form battlefield; (धर्-
मज्ञश् चासि वृष्णीनाम् आहवेष्व् अपि … ।स
जानंश् चरितं कृत्स्नं वृष्णीणां पृतना-
मुखे।) 3. 19. 13-16; Pradyumna wonder-
ed what the women of Vṛṣṇi heroes would
say to him when he met them 3. 19. 21;
Pradyumna asked his charioteer how he
could face Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis who
always vied with him (मया स्पर्धन्ति
सततं) 3. 19. 28; the charioteer in reply
told Pradyumna that he was conversant
with the war (conduct) of Vṛṣṇis (and
he defended his action) (युद्धज्ञश् चास्मि
वृष्णीनाम्) 3. 20. 2; Śālva tormented by
Vṛṣṇis rode his Saubha to rise up in
the sky and left Dvārakā 3. 20. 27; when
Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā he was sur-
prised to see the town of Vṛṣṇis with men
and women extremely uneasy (अस्वस्थ-
नरनारीकम् इदं वृष्णिपुरं भृशम्) 3.
21. 4; Kṛṣṇa then spoke to Āhuka, Vasu-
deva and Vṛṣṇi heroes asking them to
remain alert (अप्रमादः सदा कार्यो); he
announced his decision to attack Śālva
which delighted Vṛṣṇis; comforted, they
asked him to kill the enemies and blessed
him 3. 21. 7-11; (18) Dhṛtarāṣṭra feared
that Vṛṣṇi archers and spirited Pāñcālas,
led by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the army of
Kauravas 3. 48. 6; he told Saṃjaya that
it was not possible even for mountains
to withstand the velocity (of the attack)
of Vṛṣṇis when led by Rāma and Kṛṣṇa
(वृष्णीनाम् … ।न शक्यः सहितुं वेगः)
3. 48. 7; (19) When Vṛṣṇis went to
Prabhāsa to meet the Pāṇḍavas during
the period of their exile, they found
them smeared with dirt resting on bare
ground; seeing them, Vṛṣṇis were filled
with sorrow and cried loudly; Yudhiṣṭhira
approached Vṛṣṇis and honoured them as
they deserved; they too in return honoured
Pāṇḍavas and sat around them 3. 118. 15,
18-21; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana to
tell him the details of the talks between
Vṛṣṇis, sitting around, and Pāṇḍavas at
Prabhāsa 3. 119. 1-3; Sātyaki suggested to
Balarāma that he should permit the army
of Daśārhas to march against Duryodhana
so that he would perish when overtaken
by the army of Vṛṣṇis; he also said that
the army consisting of principal Kṣatriya
warriors of Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas
should kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
enhance its fame (क्षत्रियशूरसेना लोके
यशः स्फीतम् उपाकरोतु) 3. 120. 5, 19;
(20) Kṛṣṇa told Draupadī that her
sons while they were in the town of
Vṛṣṇis (Dvārakā) they were not jealous
of gods (तवात्मजा वृष्णिपुरं प्रविश्य
न दैवतेभ्यः स्पृहयन्ति कृष्णे) 3. 180.
25; Satyabhāmā assured Draupadī that
Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis had the same affec-
tion for her sons as for Pradyumna 3. 224.
14; (21) Draupadī warned Jayadratha
that if he insisted on abducting her, Vṛṣṇi
heroes led by Kṛṣṇa, would chase him
(वृष्णिवीरा … पदवीं चरेयुः) 3. 252. 16
(Nī. on 3. 268. 14 (in another context)
पदवीं चरेतां अन्वेषणं कुरुतः);
(22) Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas went
to Upaplavya to attend the marriage of
Abhimanyu 4. 67. 14, 24; Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas
and Bhojas returned to Dvārakā after the
marriage 5. 7. 1; (23) Saṃjaya advised
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was more beneficial for
him to live by begging in the kingdom of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas than get back the
kingdom by resorting to war (भैक्ष्य-
चर्यां अन्धकवृष्णिराज्ये श्रेयो मन्ये न
तु युद्धेन राज्यम्) 5. 27. 2; (24) An-
dhakas, Vārṣṇeyas and Bhojas followed
the advice of Kṛṣṇa and therefore they
could restrain the enemies and delight their
friends (अन्धकाश् च वार्ष्णेयभोजाः);
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, led by Kṛṣṇa, were
like Indra (कृष्णप्रणीताः सर्व एवेन्द्र-
कल्पाः) 5. 28. 11-12; (25) The son of
Ugrasena (Kaṃsa) once shone amongst
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्यन्धकानां
मध्यगतं तपन्तम्) 5. 47. 72; (26)
Once Nārada advised Vṛṣṇis that they
should do their duty (तस्मात् कर्मैव
कर्तव्यम् इति होवाच नारदः। … वृष्णि-
चक्रस्य) 5. 48. 22 (Nī., however, on
Bom. Ed. 5. 49. 22: कर्म युद्धं
कर्तव्यं तयोर् (i. e. कृष्णार्जुनयोः) इति
शेषः।आचष्ट आख्यातवान् नारद एव);
(27) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas could not be
subjugated by Jarāsandha either due to
the policy adopted by them or due to
sheer luck (नयेनान्धकवृष्णयः।ते न
तस्य वशं जग्मुः केवलं दैवम् एव
वा) 5. 50. 39; (28) Kṛṣṇa protected
Vṛṣṇis in all calamities (सर्वास्व् आपत्सु)
5. 70. 4; (29) According to Duryodhana
if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Vṛṣṇis would be
under his control (तस्मिन् बद्धे भवि-
ष्यन्ति वृष्णयः … विधेया मे) 5. 86. 14;
(30) When Kṛṣṇa mounted the chariot to
go to the Sabhā of Kauravas he was pro-
tected by Vṛṣṇis whose great chariot-fighters
followed him (पृष्ठतो ऽनुययुः); when
he entered the Sabhā they walked behind
him (आसन् कृष्णस्य पृष्ठतः) 5. 92. 14,
17, 33; (31) All Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis
lived happily together when the Yādavas
abandoned Kaṃsa in the interest of the
family (संभूय सुखं एधन्ते) 5. 126.
39; (32) Kṛṣṇa told Duryodhana that
he was not alone in the Sabhā; Andhakas
and Vṛṣṇis were with him; and when he
laughed to show the great miracle (महद्
आश्चर्यं 5. 129. 14) Vṛṣṇis and others,
ready with weapons (समुद्यतमहा-
युधाः), were there in front of him 5.
129. 3, 8-9; (33) Kṛṣṇa asked Karṇa to
recognize Vṛṣṇis who were his kin from
the mother's side (viz. Kuntī) (मातृपक्षे
च वृष्णयः।द्वौ पक्षाव् अभिजानीहि); in
that case Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis would
follow him 5. 138. 10, 13, 23; (34) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira settled down in his camp at Kuru-
kṣetra along with Vṛṣṇis (वृष्निभिश् चैव
 … वृतम्) 5. 150. 2; (35) Balarāma came
to Pāṇḍavas along with Vṛṣṇi chiefs (वृष्णि-
मुख्यैर् अभिगतैः) 5. 154. 17; but he
decided not to take part in the war from
any side and left for pilgrimage along with
Vṛṣṇis 9. 34. 1, 5, 12; (cf. 5. 154. 34);
(36) Before the start of the war in the
camp of Kauravas, Bṛhadbala along with
the great warriors of Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis
and Bhojas stood guard on the right side
of the army (बलं त्वदीयं दक्षिणतो
ऽभिपाति) 6. 20. 14; (37) On the ninth
day of the war, at night, Pāṇḍavas sat
down to take counsel with Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णि-
भिः सह। … मन्त्राय समुपाविशन्) 6.
103. 10; (38) In the estimate of Vṛṣṇis,
Cekitāna was a match for a hundred
warriors in battle (शताद् विशिष्टं यं
युद्धे समपश्यन्त वृष्णयः) 7. 9. 50;
(39) Droṇa, in order to encourage Jaya-
dratha said that, after all, Vṛṣṇis and the
rest were not eternal and that some day
they (and by turn they all) were going to
die (वृष्णयो ऽन्ये च मानवाः। … अध्रुवा
 … । … पर्यायेण वयं सर्वे … परलोकं
गमिष्यामः) 7. 52. 30-31; (40) Subhadrā
wondered who could have killed Abhi-
manyu when Vṛṣṇi heroes were there to
protect him; she pitied the heroism of
Vṛṣṇi warriors (नाथेषु … वृष्णिवीरेषु;
धिग् वीर्यं वृष्णिवीराणाम्) 7. 55. 9, 12;
(41) On the fourteenth day, Saṃjaya told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and
others would blame him for the confusion
in his mind (ते बुद्धिव्यभीचारम् उप-
लप्स्यन्ति) 7. 62. 7; the same day, Yudhi-
ṣṭhira remembered that Arjuna, to praise
Sātyaki, had told him in Dvaitavana that
he would need Sātyaki's help even though
Vṛṣṇis, led by Kṛṣṇa, were ready to help him
7. 85. 54, 58-60; Bhūriśravas wondered how
Arjuna could look upon Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas who, by very nature were despicable, as
authority (while deciding what was proper
or improper in war) (प्रकृत्यैव विगर्-
हिताः।वृष्ण्यन्धकाः कथं पार्थ प्र-
माणं भवता कृताः॥) 7. 118. 15; (42)
During the night war (14th-15th day),
Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would
defeat Vṛṣṇis and the rest 7. 133. 11; after
the death of Droṇa, Sātyaki told Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna that he deserved to be expelled
(from the war) by Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis
since he did a vile act and yet praised
himself (याप्यस् त्वम् असि … सर्वैश् चाप्य्-
अन्धकवृष्णिभिः) 7. 169. 11; (43) Saha-
deva told Sātyaki that just as Pāṇḍavas
had no friends other than Andhakas and
Vṛṣṇis, they too had no friends other than
Pāṇḍavas 7. 169. 48-49; Pāñcālas too
had no friends better than Pāṇḍavas and
Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 50; (44) On the fifteenth
day, when the Pāṇḍava army was being
burnt by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Yudhiṣṭhira
advised Sātyaki to leave the battle-field
along with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas 7. 170.
26; (45) On the seventeenth day, at
night (निशि 8. 1. 25), Dhṛtarāṣṭra while
lamenting the death of Karṇa, told Saṃjaya
that Karṇa, depending on the strength of
his arms, never thought highly of Vṛṣṇis
(नामन्यत वै नित्यम् … न वृष्णीन् अपि …
स्वबाहुबलम् आश्रितः॥) 8. 5. 15; (46)
After the fall of Duryodhana, when Bala-
rāma, in anger, left for Dvārakā, Pāñcālas
and Vārṣṇeyas were disheartened (पाञ्चालाश्
च सवार्ष्णेयाः … नातिप्रमनसो ऽभवन्)
9. 59. 27; (47) Kṛṣṇa narrated to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that Aśvatthāman had once come to
Dvārakā where he was highly honoured by
Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णिभिः परमार्चितः) 10. 12. 11;
Kṛṣṇa told Aśvatthāman that he was never
before requested to part with his चक्र by
any one of the great warriors among Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas (as Aśvatthāman did) 10.
12. 33; (48) Kṛṣṇa told Gāndhārī that
there was no one else except himself who
could extirpate the clan of Vṛṣṇis (सं-
हर्ता वृष्णिचक्रस्य) 11. 25. 44; (49)
While repenting the loss of life in war,
Yudhiṣṭhira said to Arjuna that if Pāṇḍa-
vas, instead of waging war, had chosen to
beg in the town of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
they would not have killed the males in the
army of their kinsmen and would not have
met with the misfortune (यद् भैक्षम्
आचरिष्याम वृष्ण्यन्धकपुरे वयम्।
ज्ञातीन् निष्पुरुषान् कृत्वा नेमां प्राप्स्याम
दुर्गतिन्) 12. 7. 3; (50) Yudhiṣṭhira while
addressing Vyāsa pitied the plight of war
widows who would curse Pāṇḍavas along
with Vṛṣṇis 12. 33. 8; (51) Kṛṣṇa told
Arjuna that a very long time had elapsed
since he was with Baladeva and other Vṛṣṇi
chiefs in Dvārakā (वृष्णिपुंगवान्) and he
would therefore like to return to Dvārakā
14. 15. 20; Arjuna assured him that he
would soon meet them; Yudhiṣṭhira re-
quested Kṛṣṇa to return to Hāstinapura
for the Aśvamedha after meeting Vṛṣṇis 14.
51. 23, 46; (52) When Kṛṣṇa returned
to Dvārakā, Vṛṣṇi heroes were celebrating
the festival of the Raivataka mountain
(विहारो वृष्णिवीराणाम् महे रैवतकस्य
ह) 14. 58. 13; Bhojas, Andhakas and
Vṛṣṇis received Kṛṣṇa on the Raivataka;
Kṛṣṇa honoured them and enquired about
the welfare of Vṛṣṇis who sat around him
(स तान् अभ्यर्च्य मेधावी पृष्ट्वा च
कुशलं तदा) 14. 58. 17-19; (53) On
hearing the war account from Kṛṣṇa, Vṛṣṇis
experienced the feelings of grief, pain,
as well as delight (दुःखहर्षपरिक्लेशा
वृष्णीनाम् अभवंस् तदा) 14. 59. 36; (54)
Kṛṣṇa, along with Vṛṣṇis, went to Hāstina-
pura for the horse sacrifice; when Vṛṣṇi
heroes lived there, Parikṣit was born,
Abhimanyu had told Uttarā that her son
would learn from Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
the science of archery, the different अस्त्रस्,
and the entire science of morals (गत्वा
वृष्ण्यन्धककुलं धनुर्वेदं ग्रही-
ष्यति।अस्त्राणि च विचित्राणि नीतिशास्त्रं च
केवलम्॥) 14. 65. 1, 8, 24; (55) When
Parikṣit was restored to life by Kṛṣṇa,
Vṛṣṇi chiefs (वृष्णिशार्दूलाः) gave Uttarā
many jewels as gift; when Pāṇḍavas arrived
at the place where Parikṣit was born,
Vṛṣṇi chiefs (वृष्णिपुंगवाः) came out
to welcome them (14. 69. 8-9, 13);
Pāṇḍavas, along with Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णिभिः
सह), entered Hāstinapura; when Vyāsa
arrived, Kuru chiefs (Pāṇḍavas) sat near
him along with Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes (सह वृष्ण्यन्धकव्याघ्रैः) 14.
70. 2, 11; (56) The Aśvamedha horse
went to Dvāravatī which was protected by
Vṛṣṇi heroes (वृष्णिवीर-) 14. 84. 13; when
the horse sacrifice was in progress, Kṛṣṇa,
with Vṛṣṇis reached Hāstinapura 14. 88. 4;
(57) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that only the
Vṛṣṇi circle (वृष्णिचक्रम्) had survived
the war due to the favour of Kṛṣṇa 15. 44.
34; (58) Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana
how were Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Bhojas
destroyed in the presence of Vāsudeva
and who pronounced the curse on them
due to which they perished 16. 2. 1, 3;
Vaiśaṃpāyana then told him that thirtysix
years (after the coronation of Yudhiṣṭhira)
Vṛṣṇis misbehaved and, as dictated by
Kāla, they killed each other with pestle;
the sages (Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and Nārada)
pronounced a curse to the effect that Sāmba
would give birth to an iron pestle for the
destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्य्-
अन्धकविनाशाय); that pestle would wipe
out the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas who were ill-
behaved, cruel and naughty, and the entire
race except Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa (येन
यूयं सुदुर्वृत्ता नृशंसा जातमन्य-
वः।उच्छेत्तारः कुलं कृत्स्नम् ऋते राम-
जनार्दनौ); when Kṛṣṇa heard what had
happened, he told Vṛṣṇis that the curse
would prove true (भवितव्यं तथा) 16.
2. 2, 8-9, 13; the next day Sāmba gave
birth to a pestle for the destruction of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; when the matter was
reported to Ugrasena he prohibited fer-
mentation of liquor in all the houses of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (अद्यप्रभृति सर्-
वेषु वृष्ण्यन्धकगृहेष्व् इह।सुरासवो न
कर्तव्यः सर्वैर् नगरवासिभिः॥) 16. 2.
15, 18; (59) When Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas were trying to protect themselves,
Kāla constantly visited their houses; a
certain bald, fierce man surveyed their
houses and disappeared; day after day
strong winds blew to foretell the de-
struction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; day and
night, सारिकास् produced shrill, unceasing
sounds in the houses of Vṛṣṇis; pale pigeons
with red feet, inspired by Kāla, moved in
the houses of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; there
occurred many other bad omens; asses with
shrill voices responded to the sound pro-
duced by Pāñcajanya (एवं प्रयतमाना-
नां वृष्णीनाम् अन्धकैः सह।कालो गृहाणि
सर्वेषां परिचक्राम नित्यशः; पाण्डुरा
रक्तपादाश् च विहगाः कालचोदिताः।वृष्ण्य्-
अन्धकानां गेहेषु कपोता व्यचरंस् तदा;
नदन्तं पाञ्चजन्यं च वृष्ण्यन्धक-
निवेशने।समन्तात् प्रत्यवाश्यन्त रासभा
दारुणस्वराः॥) 16. 3. 1-7, 10-15; Vṛṣṇis,
except Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, were not ashamed
to commit sins; the rest hated Brāhmaṇas,
fore-fathers and gods, disrespected elders
in general; women and men transgressed
rules of morality (पत्न्यः पतीन् व्युच्च-
रन्त पत्नीश् च पतयस् तथा) 16. 3.
8-9; (60) Vṛṣṇi women dreamt at night
that a black woman with white teeth,
laughing, ran around Dvārakā robbing
them and men dreamt that fierce demons
deprived them of their ornaments, छत्रस्
flag-staffs and armours; the चक्र given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agni rose up to the sky within
the sight of Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णीनां पश्यताम्);
the four horses took the chariot upwards
and the Apsarases took away, day and
night, the flag-staffs of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa
and asked Vṛṣṇis to proceed on a तीर्थ-
यात्रा 16. 4. 1-5; (61) The great Vṛṣṇi
and Andhaka heroes desired to go for a
तीर्थयात्रा along with their women; they
took with them eatables (meat) and drinks
(liquors) of different kinds and set out
of the city 16. 4. 6-8; (62) Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka heroes, overpowered by Kāla,
saw Uddhava deserting them; Kṛṣṇa knew
the iminent destruction of Vṛṣṇis and
hence he did not object to Uddhava's
leaving Vṛṣṇis (कालपरीतास् ते वृष्ण्य्-
अन्धकमहारथाः) 16. 4. 11-12; (63)
Goaded by Kāla, Andhakas, Bhojas, Śaine-
yas and Vṛṣṇis struck one another with
the दर्भस् turned into pestles 16. 4. 36
(cf. 16. 4. 34-35); (64) Brooding over the
destruction of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, Kṛṣṇa
thought it was time for him to depart
(स चिन्तयानो ऽन्धकवृष्णिनाशम् … मेने
ततः संक्रमणस्य कालम्) 16. 5. 18;
(65) Dāruka went to Kurus (i. e. Pāṇḍa-
vas) and reported to them the mutual
killings of Vṛṣṇis with pestles (आचष्ट मौ-
सले वृष्णीन् अन्योन्येनोपसंहृतान्) 16. 6. 1;
(66) Yudhiṣṭhira heard the destruction
of the Vṛṣṇi clan (शुश्राव वृष्णिचक्रस्य
मौसले कदनं कृतम्) 16. 1. 7; Pāṇḍa-
vas grieved to hear the destruction of
Vṛṣṇis (Vārṣṇeyas) due to their attacking
one another (परस्परं समासाद्य …
वृष्णीन् विनष्टांश् … ) 16. 1. 9; (विन-
ष्टान् वार्ष्णेयान् सभोजकुकुरान्धकान्)
16. 6. 2; (67) Arjuna saw Dvārakā
in the form of a river which was once
full of water in the form of Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas but now bereft of Vṛṣṇi chiefs
(तां स वृष्ण्यन्धकजलाम् … द्वारका-
सरितं … विहीनां वृष्णिपुंगवैः) 16. 6.
8, 10-11; (68) Kṛṣṇa had asked Vasu-
deva to inform Arjuna on his arrival at
Dvārakā about the calamity that overtook
Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णीनां वैशसं महत्) 16. 7.
14; (69) Vasudeva told Arjuna that
Vṛṣṇis were destroyed due to the miscon-
duct of Pradyumna and Sātyaki; the two
started the destruction of Vṛṣṇis (तयोर्
अपनयात् पार्थ वृष्णयो निधनं गताः।
 … प्रद्युम्नो युयुधानश् च … । … ताव्
उभौ वृष्णिनाशस्य मुखम् आस्ताम्) 16.
7. 5-7; (70) Arjuna told Vasudeva that
he would take with him the women of
Vṛṣṇīs as well as their old men and
children (वृष्णिदारांस् तु बालवृद्धांस्
तथैव च); he informed Dāruka that
he would like to meet the ministers of
Vṛṣṇi heroes (अमात्यान् वृष्णिवीराणाम्); he
assured the gathering assembled in the
Sudharmā Hall that he himself would take
with him the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka people
to Indraprastha (अहं नेष्ये वृष्ण्यन्धक-
जनं स्वयम्) 16. 8. 5, 6, 10; (71)
Before departure, young Vṛṣṇi princes, led
by Vajra, and the women offered oblations
of water to Vasudeva (ततो वज्रप्रधानास्
ते वृष्णिवीरकुमारकाः।सर्व एवोदकं
चक्रुः स्त्रियश् चैव महात्मनः॥); then
Arjuna went to the place where Vṛṣṇis
were destroyed; he was grieved to see
them dead and did whatever was necessary
on that occasion (प्राप्तकालं चकार
च) 16. 8. 27-29; (72) On the seventh
day after the funeral rites of Vasudeva and
others, Arjuna started for Indraprastha;
Vṛṣṇi women, weeping and grieved, followed
him in carriages drawn by horses, bulls,
asses and camels (पाण्डवः।सप्तमे
दिवसे प्रायाद् … अश्वयुक्तैर् रथैश् चापि
गोखरोष्ट्रयुतैर् अपि।स्त्रियस् ता वृष्णि-
वीराणाम् … अनुजग्मुर् … ॥); he was also
followed by the servants of Andhakas and
Vṛṣṇis, as well as, by horse-riders, chari-
oteers, and those riding elephants along
with their foot-guards armed with exce-
llent weapons (कुञ्जरैश् च गजारोहा
ययुः … सपादरक्षैः संयुक्ताः सोत्तरा-
युधिका ययुः); citizens, young and old,
including sons of Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, all
the four castes and their women followed
him; sixteen thousand wives of Vāsudeva
(Kṛṣṇa) left Dvārakā following Vajra
(दश षट् च सहस्राणिवासुदे वावरोध-
नम्); the number of Bhoja, Andhaka, and
Vṛṣṇi women who had lost their husbands
was extremely large (बहूनि च सहस्राणि
प्रयुतान्य् अर्बुदानि च।भोजवृष्ण्यन्धक-
स्त्रीणां हतनाथानि निर्ययुः॥); the large
number of prosperous Vṛṣṇi people looked
like an ocean (तत् सागरसमप्रख्यं
वृष्णिचक्रं महर्धिमत्); when those
dwellers of Dvārakā left, the city was
plunged in waters of ocean; the citizens
left in great hurry crying ‘oh! this was
our Fate!’ (तूर्णात् तूर्णतरम् जग्मुर्
अहो दैवम् इति ब्रुवन्॥) 16. 8. 32-41;
(73) While Arjuna was taking Vṛṣṇis
and their women with him, in Pañca-
nada they were attacked by Ābhīras
(Dasyus) in order to deprive them of
their wealth (अभ्यधावन्त वृष्णीनां तं
जनं लोप्त्रहारिणः … अभिपेतुर् धना-
र्थं ते) 16. 8. 42-48; Vṛṣṇi warriors,
riding elephants, horses and chariots, were
unable to check the robbers carrying away
Vṛṣṇi women; Arjuna tried to protect the
large number of women running in different
directions (कलत्रस्य बहुत्वात् तु सं-
पतत्सु ततस् ततः); the excellent women
were dragged away in the presence of all
warriors; but some went willingly (प्रम-
दोत्तमाः।समन्ततो ऽवकृष्यन्त कामाच्
चान्याः प्रवव्रजुः) 16. 8. 42, 47, 55-57;
(74) Then Arjuna, helped by Vṛṣṇi ser-
vants, struck Dasyus with arrows (शरैः
पार्थो … ।जघान दस्यून् … वृष्णिभृत्यैः
सह प्रभुः॥); excellent women of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were abducted by
Mlecchas in spite of Arjuna (प्रेक्षतस् त्व्
एव पार्थस्य वृष्ण्यन्धकवरस्त्रियः।
जग्मुर् आदाय ते म्लेच्छाः॥); the few
women of Vṛṣṇīs who escaped were taken
by Arjuna to Kurukṣetra and he settled
them there at various places (ततः स
शेषम् आदाय कलत्रस्य महामतिः।
हृतभूयिष्ठरत्नस्य कुरुक्षेत्रम् अवा-
तरत्।एवं कलत्रम् आनीय वृष्णीनां
हृतशेषितम्।न्यवेशयत कौरव्यस् तत्र
तत्र धनंजयः॥) 16. 8. 58, 61, 65-66;
(75) Arjuna informed Vyāsa about the
destruction of Vṛṣṇi heroes at Prabhāsa
caused by the curse of Brāhmaṇas; five
hundred thousand brave Bhoja, Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka warriors had killed one another
with एरका grass; he also told him that
thousands of Vṛṣṇi women were abducted
by Ābhīras of Pañcanada in spite of him
(हतं पञ्चशतं तेषां सहस्रं (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 16. 8. 11: पञ्चशतं
सहस्रं सहस्रगुणितं पञ्चलक्षानीत्य्
अर्थः); वृष्णिदाराश् च … सहस्रशः।
आभीरैर् … हृताः पञ्चनदालयैः हृताः)
16. 9. 8-11, 16; (76) Vyāsa consoled
Arjuna by saying that the great warriors
of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas were burnt by
the curse of Brāhmaṇas and therefore
Arjuna should not be grieved over their
destruction; what had happened was bound
to happen for that was dictated by fate for
the magnanimous (Vṛṣṇis) (भवितव्यं
तथा तद् धि दिष्टम् एतन् महात्मनाम्)
16. 9. 25-26; (77) Arjuna reported to
Yudhiṣṭhira exactly what had happened to
Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka people (आचष्ट तद्
यथावृत्तम्) 16. 9. 38; (78) Janamejaya
asked Vaiśaṃpāyana what the Pāṇḍavas
did after hearing about the strife in the
family of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्यन्-
धककुले … आहवम्); Vaiśaṃpāyana told
him that having heard about the great
destruction of Vṛṣṇis (वृष्णीनां कदनं
महत्), Yudhiṣṭhira decided to leave the
kingdom (to retire to the forest); consi-
dering the destruction of Vṛṣṇis and know-
ing the decision of Yudhiṣṭhira, all his
brothers were glad to follow him (हर्षो
ऽभवच् च सर्वेषां भ्रातॄणां गमनं
प्रति।युधिष्ठिरमतं ज्ञात्वा वृष्णि-
क्षयम् अवेक्ष्य च) 17. 1. 1-2, 22; (79) In
heaven, Yudhiṣṭhira was shown great heroes
of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas (वृष्ण्यन्धक-
महारथान्) among the groups of Sādhyas,
Vasus and Maruts 18. 4. 14.

हयान्॥कोटिशश् चैव बहुशः सुवर्णं
पद्मसंमितम्॥बलिम् आदाय विविधं
द्वारि तिष्ठन्ति वारिताः॥) 2. 47. 26-27; they
are mentioned a third time along with
Aṅgas, Vaṅgas and others whose kings
(क्षत्रियाः) brought large amount of wealth
as tribute (आहार्षुः क्षत्रिया वित्तं शत-
शः); when asked by the gate-keepers to
give more, each one of them gave a thou-
sand elephants from the Kāmyaka lake and
then were allowed to enter; the elephants
given by them are described in stanzas 2.
48. 15-20; Kṛṣṇa mentioned Śakas among
those whose kings, afraid of the lustre of
the weapons of Pāṇḍavas, acted as servers
at the Rājasūya sacrifice (शकान्। … मही-
पालान् शस्त्रतेजोभयार्दितान्। … यज्ञे
ते परिवेषकान्) 3. 48. 18, 20, 22; (2)
Drupada asked Yudhiṣṭhira to send his
messengers to the kings of Śakas and others
to seek their help in war 5. 4. 7, 9, 15; (3)
Kāmboja Sudakṣiṇa came to Duryodhana
with an army of अक्षौहिणी fighters consi-
sting of Yavanas and Śakas; it looked like
a swarm of locusts (तस्य सेनासमावायः
शलभानाम् इवाबभौ) 5. 19. 21-22;
Duryodhana's army consisted of different
peoples, Śakas being one of them; like the
army of gods it was difficult to be attacked
(दुराधर्षां देवचमूप्रकाशाम्) 5. 158.
19-20; Śaka kings with their armies led
by Śakuni marched towards Kurukṣetra
in the second division of the Kaurava army
(शकाः … द्वितीये निर्ययुर् बले) 5. 196. 7;
there, on the battle-field, before the start of
the war, Kṛpa along with Śakas, Kirātas
and others protected the Kaurava army in
the north (चमूम् उत्तरतो ऽभिपाति) 6.
20. 13; (4) On the third day of the war,
the Kāmboja king along with the Śakas
was posted at the ‘tail’ (पुच्छम् आसन्) of
the Garuḍavyūha (6. 52. 2) of Kauravas
6. 52. 7; (5) On the sixth day, Śakas,
Yavanas and others stood at the right wing
(दक्षिणम् पक्षम् आश्रित्य) of the Krauñca-
vyūha (6. 71. 14) of the Kauravas 6. 71. 20;
(6) On the eleventh day, Śakas, Yavanas
and others riding swift horses stood at
the extreme end of the left wing (सव्यं
पार्श्वं … तेषां प्रपक्षाः … ययुर् अश्वैर्
महावेगैः) of the Śakaṭavyūha (7. 6. 15)
of Kauravas 7. 6. 4-5; (7) On the eleventh
day, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, while recounting past
exploits of Kṛṣṇa remembered his victory
over hordes of enemies consisting of Āvan-
tyas and others who came from different
directions and joined the Śakas riding
horses (?) (आवन्त्यान् … नानादिग्भ्यश् च
संप्राप्तान् व्रातान् अश्वशकान् प्रति।जितवान्
पुण्डरीकाक्षो … ) 7. 10. 16-18 (See Editor's
note on the stanza Vol. IX. pp. 1144-1145:
श्ब्र्। (शतपथ ब्राह्मण) appears to
use this word to signify ‘excrement of a
horse’! Here it seems to mean a particular
(disgusting ?) tribe of Śakas who were
horse-riders (cf. {#aSvapuruza#} in 6. 1. 7); (8)
On the twelfth day, Śakas were among
those who occupied the ‘neck’ (ग्रीवायाम्)
of the Suparṇavyūha (7. 19. 4) of Kaura-
vas 7. 19. 7-8; (9) On the fourteenth
day, fierce Śakas, Yavanas and others
formed innumerable hordes in hundreds
and thousands (व्राताः शतसहस्रशः) to
attack Arjuna; he fought them with arrows
and cut them off with his skill in shooting
arrows (अशातयत् … अस्त्रमायया); afraid,
they all fled 7. 68. 41-45; (10) The same
day, Sātyaki expected to encounter them in
his onward march towards Arjuna (शकैश्
चापि समेष्यामि) 7. 87. 50; Sātyaki asked
his charioteer to drive his chariot to Śakas
and other Mlecchas who, riding chariots
and elephants and holding different kinds
of weapons in their hands, were eager to
fight with him (माम् एवाभिमुखाः सर्वे
तिष्ठन्ति समरार्थिनः); Sātyaki was con-
fident to defeat them 7. 95. 13-14; in the
encounter that followed, Śakas and others
showered arrows on Sātyaki; he cut off
their arrows and killed them by thousands
covering the earth with their blood and
flesh; those who escaped death fled swiftly
in fright; Sātyaki thus defeated the large
army of Śakas 7. 95. 32-33, 38-39, 45;
three thousand horse-riders of Śakas and
others, led by Duryodhana, returned to
the battlefield to attack Sātyaki; he killed
many of them 7. 97. 13-14, 20; (11) On
the seventeenth day, Kāmbojas, Śakas and
Yavanas, led by Saṃśaptakas guarded the
extremity of the left side (वामं पार्श्वम्
अपालयन् … तेषां प्रपक्षः) of the Bārha-
spatyavyūha (8. 31. 26) of Kauravas 8. 31.
14-15; in the course of that day, after the
death of the younger brother of Kāmboja
Sudakṣiṇa, there was fierce fighting (घोरम्
अद्भुतदर्शनम्) in which Śakas riding
horses took part; a large number of them
were killed 8. 40. 107-110; later that day,
Kṛṣṇa in order to encourage Arjuna told him
that Śakas had joined the Kaurava army for
the sake of Duryodhana and no one else but
he (Arjuna) could defeat them (न शक्या
युधि निर्जेतुं त्वदन्येन परंतप) 8.
51. 18, 20; Śakas, who held excellent
weapons in their hands and were ready to
shoot arrows, riding horses, chariots and
elephants, rushed at Arjuna to kill him
(आततायिनः।शकास् … ॥वरायुधान् पाणिग-
तान्); Arjuna cut off their hands and heads,
killed their horses and elephants and broke
their chariots 8. 64. 16-17; (12) On the
seventeenth day, at night (निशि 8. 1. 25), when
Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death
of Karṇa, he while remembering the past
heroism of Karṇa mentioned that he had
formerly defeated Śakas and many others
and made them pay tribute (चक्रे बलिभृ-
तः पुरा) 8. 5. 18, 20 (reference to Karṇa's
दिग्विजय at the time of Duryodhana's
वैष्णवयज्ञ 3. 241. 19, 32 (Vol. 4. App.
I. 24. 28-34); (13) On the eighteenth
day, Kṛpa with Śakas and Yavanas stood
on the right side (दक्षिणे पार्श्वे) of the
Sarvatobhadravyūha (9. 7. 19) of Kaura-
vas 9. 7. 24; (14) At the end of the war,
Saṃjaya mentioned Śakas among those
who were killed in the war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra remembered that Śakas and others
had joined his side not caring for death
while fighting (मदर्थम् उद्यताः सर्वे
प्राणांस् त्यक्त्वा रणे); Duryodhana boast-
ed his ability to fight with Pāṇḍavas due to
the support of Śakas 9. 2. 8, 21-22.
E. Past
event: Māndhātṛ once asked Indra how
people like Śakas were to be made to follow
Dharma and how kings like him should
control them (कथं धर्मं चरेयुस् ते
 … मद्विधैश् च कथं स्थाप्याः); Indra
thereupon told Māndhātṛ the duties of
Dasyus (the term Dasyu apparently covered
Śakas) 12. 65. 13, 15, 17-21.
F. Future
event: Śakas are mentioned among many
kings who at the end of the Yuga (यु-
गान्ते समनुप्राप्ते) 3. 186. 30; युगान्ते 3.
186. 33; युगक्षये 3. 186. 43, 48) would
rule the earth the wrong way, would be
sinful and would be given to tell lies (मि-
थ्यानुशासिनः पापा मृषावादपरायणाः)
3. 186. 29-30.

शण्ड
Śaṇḍa m. (pl.): Name of a people.
Rākṣasa Kalmāṣapāda told a certain
king that Śaṇḍas were the bodily dirt of
Mauṣṭikas and those whose sacrificial
priests were of the warrior caste were the
dirt of Śaṇḍas (मौष्टिकानां मलं
शण्डाः शण्डानां राजयाजकाः) 8. 30. 70.

शबर
Śabara m. (pl.): Name of a forest
tribe.
A. Location: (1) Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of the Bhāratavarṣa (अत
ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध) 6. 10. 37, 5;
अटवी शबराश् चैव 6. 10. 46 (Are Aṭavī-
śabaras living in the north different from
the other Śabaras who lived in the south ?
see the next); (2) Śabaras who lived in
the south (दक्षिणापथजन्मानः) 12. 200.
39 (these are, however, not listed by Saṃ-
jaya among the southern Janapadas of the
Bhāratavarṣa 6. 10. 56-63ab).
B. Origin:
(1) Angered Nandinī, the cow of Vasiṣṭha,
created Śabaras from her dung (असृजत् …
शकृतः शबरान् … क्रोधमूर्च्छिता) 1.
165. 35; this event is said to have occurred
also on a different occasion; when Viśvā-
mitra's army destroyed the forest near Vasi-
ṣṭha's आश्रम, he angered, asked his cow
to produce Śabaras; accordingly she pro-
duced them (क्रुद्धो … वसिष्ठः … ।
सृजस्व शबरान् घोरान् इति स्वां गाम् उवाच
ह) 9. 39. 20; (2) Some Kṣatriyas are
also said to have been degraded to the
state of a वृषल due to their disregard of
Brāhmaṇas (शबरबर्बराः॥ … तास् ताः
क्षत्रियजातयः।वृषलत्वम् अनुप्राप्ता
ब्राह्मणानाम् अदर्शनात्॥) 13. 35. 17-18;
elsewhere it is stated that the Kṣatriyas
who killed Jamadagni became वृषल due
to their transgressing the धर्म of Kṣa-
triyas and their disregard of Brāhmaṇas
(तेषां (i. e. क्षत्रियाणाम्)  … प्रजा वृषल-
तां प्राप्ता ब्राह्मणानाम् अदर्शनात्॥त
एते … पुण्ड्राश् च शबरैः सह।वृषलत्वं
परिगता व्युत्थानात् क्षत्रधर्मतः॥)
14. 29. 15-16; (3) But at one place it is
mentioned that Śabaras and others existed
since the Tretāyuga (त्रेताप्रभृति वर्तन्ते
ते जना …  (i. e. Śabaras and others) 12.
200. 39, 42.
C. Description: Fierce,
fierce to look at (घोर, घोरदर्शन) 9.
39. 20-21.
D. Their low status: They are
characterized as दस्युस् 12. 65. 17, 21; also
cf.
F. Past events (2) below; those men
who did not perform sacrifices remained
for ever in the nether worlds and did not
go to heaven; such men are compared with
Pulindas and Śabaras (अर्वाक् च प्रति-
तिष्ठन्ति पुलीन्दशबरा इव।न ह्य् अयज्ञा
अमुं लोकं प्राप्नुवन्ति कथंचन) 12.
147. 8; they are included among those
people who, though they lived in countries,
led the life of दस्युस् (शबरबर्बराः। …
सर्वे विषयवासिनः।सर्वे ते दस्युजीवि-
नः॥) 12. 65. 13, 15; they did not believe in
Bhūtapati as the अध्यक्ष (of the world);
sinful, they roamed over the earth leading
the life of dogs, crows, बलस् (?) and
vultures (निरध्यक्षांस् तु कौन्तेय कीर्त-
यिष्यामि … ।उत्साः पुलिन्दाः शबरा … ॥एते
पापकृतस् तात चरन्ति पृथिवीम् इमाम्।
श्वकाकबलगृध्राणां सधर्माणो … ॥)
12. 200. 38-39, 41.
E. Epic events:
(1) On the second day of the war,
Śabaras on the side of Pāṇḍavas stood on
the left side of the Krauñcāruṇavyūha (6.
46. 39; Krauñca 6. 47. 1) of Pāṇḍavas
(वामं पार्श्वं समाश्रिताः) 6. 46. 51;
(2) On the fourteenth day, Sātyaki
killed thousands of Śabaras (on the side
of Kauravas); he covered the ground
with their flesh and blood, and also with
their shaven heads and head gears (सशिर-
स्त्राणैः शिरोभिर् लूनमूर्धजैः) 7. 95.
38-40.
F. Past event: (1) King Mān-
dhātṛ once asked Indra the nature of the
धर्म of people like Śabaras and how
kings like him should govern them (कथं
धर्मं चरेयुस् ते … मद्विधैश् च
कथं स्थाप्याः) 12. 65. 13-15; thereupon
Indra told him the duties of Dasyus (the
term apparently covers Śabaras) 12. 65.
17-21; (2) A certain Brāhmaṇa, Gau-
tama by name, took residence in the house
of a Dasyu which is later designated as
the excellent house (गृहवर) of a rich,
Śabara (शबरालय) 12. 162. 30, 34; 12.
165. 5; 12. 167. 16 (see Dasyu, Past events
I, no. 7, p. 750 above).

शरदण्ड
Śaradaṇḍa m. (pl. ?): Name of a
country.
The horses of this country were referred
to as शरदण्डज; these horses were yoked
to the chariot of Daṇḍaketu (शरदण्डानु-
दण्डजाः। … दण्डकेतुम् उदावहन्) 7. 22.
58 [See Editor's note on the stanza, Cr.
Edn. Vol. 9, pp. 1147-1148: “ … Śaradaṇḍa
and Anudaṇḍa would be names of different
countries. We know nothing of Anudaṇḍa,
but Śaradaṇḍa was the name of a country
belonging to Śālva in Madhyadeśa (Kāśikā
on Pāṇini IV. 1. 173: शरदण्डाश् च शाल्वा-
वयवसंज्ञिताः)”].

शर्मक
Śarmaka m. (pl.): Name of a people.

भीम
Bhīma during his expedition to the
east (ययौ प्राचीं दिशम् प्रति 2. 26. 1;
2. 23. 9) before the Rājasūya won over
Śarmakas through conciliation (शर्मकान्
 … सान्त्वेनैवाजयत् प्रभुः) 2. 27. 12.

शर्मिल
Śarmila m. (pl.): Name of a people.
On the second day of war, Duryodhana
along with Śarmilas and others gave pro-
tection to the army of Śakuni (शर्मिल-
कोसलैः॥ … अभ्यरक्षत … सौबलेयस्य
वाहिनीम्) 6. 47. 15-16.

शाकद्वीप
Śākadvīpa nt. (sg.): Name of one of
the seven Dvīpas.
A. Location and extent: According
to Draupadī, it was similar to Krauñca-
dvīpa and lay to the east of Mahāmeru;
the Dvīpa known as Bhadrāśva which lay
to the north of Mahāmeru was in extent
equal to Śākadvīpa (क्रौञ्चद्वीपेन स-
दृशः शाकद्वीपो … ।पूर्वेण तु महा-
मेरोः … उत्तरेण महामेरोः शाकद्वीपेन
संमितः।भद्राश्वः … ॥) 12. 14 23-24;
according to Saṃjaya, Śākadvīpa was
double the size of Jambūdvīpa and the
ocean which surrounded it was also double
its size (जम्बूद्वीपप्रमाणेन द्विगुणः
स … ।विष्कम्भेण महाराज सागरोऽपि
विभागशः।क्षीरोदो भरतश्रेष्ठ येन
संपरिवारितः) 6. 12. 9; Śākadvīpa was
larger than Jambūdvīpa both in length
and breadth (परिवार्य तु कौरव्य दैर्-
घ्यं ह्रस्वत्वम् एव च।जम्बूद्वीपेन)
6. 12. 25.
B. Some geographical details of
the Śākadvīpa: There are seven mountains
on Śākadvīpa (Meru, Malaya, Jaladhāra,
Raivataka, Śyāma, Durgaśaila and Kesarī);
the mountains are described in 6. 12. 13-
21 (for which see Vol. I, section 5); the
Varṣas related to these mountains are
detailed in 6. 12. 22-24.
C. Possible
explanation of the name: A famous
big tree named Śāka stood in its middle
(that was why probably the Dvīpa was so
called) ( … विख्यातस् तस्य मध्ये महा-
द्रुमः॥शाको नाम महाराज तस्य
द्वीपस्य मध्यगः।) 6. 12. 25-26.
D. Description of the countries and the
peoples of Śākadvīpa: Highly lustrous
(महौजस्) 6. 12. 37; the Janapadas on
this Dvipa were holy; famine was not
known; the people were endowed with for-
bearance and lustre; they did not die (तत्र
पुण्या जनपदा (also 6. 12. 33) न तत्र
म्रियते जनः।कुत एव हि दुर्भिक्षं
क्षमातेजोयुता हि ते॥) 6. 12. 10; God
Śaṅkara was worshipped there (पूज्यते
तत्र शंकरः); Siddhas, Cāraṇas and
various deities visited it (तत्र गच्छन्ति
सिद्धाश् च चारणा दैवतानि च) 6. 12 26-
27; all the four kinds of subjects were
highly religious (धार्मिकाश् च प्रजा …
चत्वारो ऽतीव … ) 6. 12. 27; the Varṇas
followed their respective duties; they
were long-lived, free from oldage and
death; they multiplied like the rivers in
the rainy season (प्रजास् तत्र विवर्धन्ते
वर्षास्व् इव समुद्रगाः) 6. 12. 28-29;
no thief was ever met with there (न च
स्तेनोऽत्र दृश्यते) 6. 12. 28; there was
no king, no punishment, nor the officers to
inflict punishment (न तत्र राजा राजेन्द्र
न दण्डो न च दण्डिकाः); by following
their respective धर्मस् the people pro-
tected it and also protected one another
(स्वधर्मेणैव धर्मं च ते रक्षन्ति
परस्परम्) 6. 12. 36; the four holy Jana-
padas on the Dvīpa, honoured in the worlds
(लोकसंमताः), are known as Maga,
Maśaka, Mānasa and Mandaga; they are
described 6, 12. 33-36; the holy rivers
on the Śākadvīpa are Gaṅgā, flowing in
various streams (बहुधागतिः), Sukumārī,
Kumārī, Sītā, Kāverakā, Mahānadī, Maṇi-
jalā, and Ikṣuvardhanikā; several hundreds
and thousands of holy rivers arose from
them, from the waters of which Indra gave
rain (यतो वर्षति वासवः); it is not
possible to name them all nor to describe
their extent; all these excellent rivers are
holy (न तासां नामधेयानि परिमाणं
तथैव च।शक्यते परिसंख्यातुं
पुण्यास् ता हि सरिद्वराः) 6. 12. 29-32.
E. Epic events: (1) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya to describe to him the Śāka-
dvīpa; Saṃjaya agreed and described it
in brief (शाकद्वीपस्य संक्षेपो … ) 6.
12. 2, 11; on Dhṛtarāṣṭra's further request
to describe the Dvīpa in details (विस्तरम्)
Saṃjaya described it in some detail which
was worth hearing (एतावद् एव श्रोतव्यम्);
that was about all that Saṃjaya could tell
about the Dvīpa 6. 12. 12, 37; (2) In
order to revive the spirits of Yudhiṣṭhira
after the war, Draupadī reminded him that
formerly he had passed through the ocean
and brought under control various large
Dvīpas including the Śākadvīpa and the
islands in-between and the Janapadas
situated on them (शाकद्वीपो … । … दण्डेन
मृदितस् त्वया; द्वीपाश् च सान्तरद्वीपा
नानाजनपदालयाः।विगाह्य सागरं वीर
दण्डेन मृदितास् त्वया) 12. 14. 23, 25 (a
reference to Arjuna's expedition before the
Rājasūya 2. 23. 15-16; Nīlakaṇṭha on Bom.
Ed. 12. 14. 23: क्रौञ्चद्वीपादिवशीकरणम्
सिद्धद्वारा (?) राजसूये).

शाकलावत्
Śākalāvat m. (pl.): People living in
the town Śākala.
Karṇa while deriding Śalya told him
what a certain Brāhmaṇa had once told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra (8. 30. 7, 28); according to him
the people of the town Śākala, young and
old, well-adorned, and their fair and large
women, ate meat of many rams mixed with
onions and गण्डूष (?), as also meat
of pigs, fowls, cows, asses and camels;
they said that the lives of those who did
not eat meat of sheep was futile; they
danced and sang songs of this nature
when they drank liquor; good conduct
was not expected of such people (ऐडं
च ये न खादन्ति तेषां जन्म निरर्थ-
कम्॥इति गायन्ति ये मत्ताः शीधुना
शाकलावतः।सबालवृद्धाः कूर्दन्तस्
तेषु वृत्तं कथं भवेत्॥) 8. 30. 31-
33; also cf. Śākala city p. 573).

शानवत्य
Śānavatya m. (pl.): Name of a
people.
Their Kṣatriyas brought wealth in
hundreds as tribute for the Rājasūya of
Yudhiṣṭhira (शानवत्या गयास् तथा। …
आहार्षुः क्षत्रिया वित्तं शतशोऽजातशत्रवे)
2. 48. 15-16; they and others were stopped
at the gate by gate-keepers and were asked
to give more to get entrance (कृतकाराः
सुबलयस् ततो द्वारम् अवाप्स्यथ); when
each one of them then gave one thousand
elephants from the Kāmyaka forest they
were allowed to enter (अभितः काम्यकं
सरः।दत्त्वैकैको दशशतान् कुञ्जरान्)
2. 48. 18-20; the elephants described in 2.
48. 19-20.

शाल्व

Name of a Janapada and its people; people
once referred to as शाल्वाश्रयाः 6. 114. 77.
A. Location: Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas of Bhārata-
varṣa (अत ऊर्ध्वं जनपदान् निबोध)
6. 10. 37, 5; (शाल्वमाद्रेयजाङ्गलाः) 6. 10.
37; designated as Janapada also in 4. 1.
9; 6. 18. 13-14; 6. 114. 77, and as Rāṣṭra

C. Epic events:
(1) Śālvas were among those peoples who,
afraid of Jarāsandha, had left north to take
shelter in the south; their (of Śālveyas)
kings also, along with their brothers and
followers, fled to the south (शाल्वाः पट-
च्चराः। … शाल्वेयानां च राजानः सोदर्या-
नुचरैः सह … तथोत्तरां दिशं चापि
परित्यज्य भयार्दिताः … दक्षिणां दिशम्
आश्रिताः) 2. 13. 25-27; (2) Jayadratha,
wanting to marry, was proceeding to the
country of Śālveyas (शाल्वेयान् प्रयातः सो
ऽभवत् तदा) 3. 248. 6; (3) Śālva was one

Yudhiṣṭhira for their stay during the year
of अज्ञातवास 4. 1. 8-10; (4) Śālveyakas,
along with Matsyas led by Kīcaka, had
often subdued Suśarman, the king of Tri-
gartas (अस्कृन् निकृतः पूर्वं मत्स्यैः
शाल्वेयकैः सह) 4. 29. 2; (5) Saṃjaya
reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Śālveyas were
among those who did not respect him any
longer and had gone to the side of Pāṇḍa-
vas (शाल्वेयाः … सर्वे त्वाम् अवजानते) 5.
53. 17; (6) According to Saṃjaya's
report, the five Kekaya brothers (on the
side of Pāṇḍavas) were supposed to engage
the Śālvas and Kekayas (both, on the
side of Kauravas) in the forthcoming war

come unassailable and had become like the
army of the gods (दुराधर्षां देवचमू-
प्रकाशां) 5. 158. 19-20; (8) Bhīṣma had
assured Duryodhana that he alone would
kill the Pāṇḍava army along with Śālve-
yakas; that was his responsibility (अहं
हन्ता पाण्डवानाम् अनीकं शाल्वेयकांश्
चेति ममैष भारः) 5. 160. 10; (9) On
the battle-field before the start of the war,
Śālvas were among the twelve Janapadas,

चिन्त्य … ददाह); afflicted by Arjuna's
arrows and their chariots and banners
broken (विप्रकीर्णरथध्वजाः), they did
not attack Arjuna (नाभ्यवर्तन्त … वानर-
ध्वजम्); he scattered their army (द्राव-
यित्वा वरूथिनीम्) (6. 112. 110-117); later,
the same day, just before the fall of Bhīṣma,
Śālvas were among the twelve Janapadas
who, though they were afflicted by arrows
and pained due to wounds (शरार्ता व्रण-
पीडिताः) did not abandon Bhīṣma fighting
with Arjuna, even when the Kaurava
army fled due to fear (वयं … भीताः …
प्रद्रवाम महारणात्; … शाल्वाश्रयास् …
द्वादशैते जनपदाः शरार्ता व्रणपीडिताः।
संग्रामे न जहुर् भीष्मं युध्यमानं
किरीटिना) 6. 114. 75-77; (13) On the

and Virāṭa, speedily attacked Droṇa (मत्-
स्याः शाल्वेयसेनाश् च द्रोणम् आजग्मुर्
अञ्जसा) 7. 73. 50; in the evening of that
day (सायाह्ने 7. 129. 5), they again
attacked Droṇa 7. 129. 7; (14) On the
sixteenth day, Śālvas were among those
who attacked Arjuna showering him with
arrows; although they were getting killed,
they did not leave Arjuna as the moths
the fire (समरे नाजहुः पाण्डवं
तदा। … शलभा इव पावकम्) 8. 19. 2-3,
7; (15) On the seventeenth day, Karṇa
told Śalya what a certain Brāhmaṇa had
once told Dhṛtarāṣṭra; according to him,
Śālvas knew what the eternal धर्म was
(धर्मं जानन्ति शाश्वतम्); he told Śalya
that Śālvas knew what the speaker intend-
ed to convey only when all details were
told to them (अर्धोक्ताः कुरुपाञ्चालाः
शाल्वाः कृत्स्नानुशासिनः) 8. 30. 8, 60-61,
79.

13. 24-25; (2) Having heard the news
of the death of Haṃsa and Ḍibhaka, Jarā-
sandha (left the country) of Śūrasenas to
return to his town in Magadha (जरासन्-
धः … स्वपुरं शूरसेनानां प्रययौ)
2. 13. 43; (See Edgerton's note on the
stanza in Vol. II, p. 496: “This latter
reading (°सेनेभ्यः) confirms my inter-
pretation of शूरसेनानां as ablative
genitive (Speyer, व्। स्। स्। § ७३) in the sense
of “from the Śūrasena country””); (3)
Sahadeva in his expedition to the south of
Indraprastha (प्रययौ दक्षिणां दिशम् 2.
28. 1; 2. 23. 9) first conquered the entire
land of Śūrasenas (स शूरसेनान् कार्त्स्-
न्येन पूर्वम् एवाजयत् प्रभुः) 2. 28. 2;
(4) Arjuna mentioned Śūrasena among the
countries in which Pāṇḍavas could stay
during their अज्ञातवास 4. 1. 9; (5) Saṃ-
jaya told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Śūrasenas no
longer respected him and that they had
joined the side of Yudhiṣṭhira recognizing
his heroism (वीर्यज्ञास् तस्य धीमतः)
5. 53. 17; (6) Before the start of the
war, Śūrasenas (who went to Kauravas)
were among the twelve Janapadas who,
led by Duḥśāsana and other sons of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, guarded the rear of Bhīṣma;
they were all chariot-fighters twenty thou-
sand strong (पृष्ठगोपास् तु भिष्मस्य
 … रथा विंशतिसाहस्राः; महता रथ-
वंशेन ते ऽभ्यरक्षन् पितामहम्) 6.
18. 10, 12, 14; (7) On the second day
of the war, in the Mahāvyūha (6. 47. 10)
of Kauravas Duryodhana asked Śūrasenas
and others to protect Bhīṣma with their
armies (भीष्मम् एवाभिरक्षन्तु सह
सैन्यपुरस्कृताः) 6. 47. 7, 9; Arjuna while
proceeding to attack Bhīṣma killed many
Śūrasenas in the Kaurava army 6. 48. 19;
(8) On the third day, all Śūrasenas were
posted at the ‘tail’ of the Garuḍavyūha
(6. 52. 2-3) of Kauravas (पुच्छम् आसन् …
शूरसेनाश् च सर्वशः) 6. 52. 7; (9) On
the ninth day, Śūrasenas were among those
who did not forsake Bhīṣma in the battle
although they were being killed by sharp
arrows (संग्रामे नाजहुर् भीष्मं वध्य-
मानाः शितैः शरैः) 6. 102. 7; (10) On
the tenth day, incited by Duryodhana to
attack Arjuna Śūrasenas marched on him;
Arjuna burnt (ददाह) them with his divine
weapons; when afflicted by arrows and
when their chariots and banners were sha-
ttered, their kings stopped attacking Arjuna
(शरार्ता … विप्रकी र्णरथध्वजाः।नाभ्य-
वर्तन्त राजानः सहिता वानरध्वजम्);
Arjuna scattered their army (6. 112. 102-
106, 109-112, 114-116); towards the end
of that day, when the Kaurava army, afraid
of Arjuna, fled from the battle, Śūrasenas
were among those twelve Janapadas who,
though afflicted by arrows and pained due
to wounds, did not abandon Bhīṣma fighting
with Arjuna (शूरसेनाः … द्वादशैते जन-
पदा शरार्ता व्रणपीडिताः।संग्रामे न
जहुर् भीष्मं युध्यमानं किरीटिना॥)
6. 114. 76-77; (11) On the eleventh day,
Śūrasenas and others led by Duryodhana
marched behind Karṇa in the Śakaṭavyūha
(7. 6. 15) of Kauravas (तवात्मजं पुरस्-
कृत्य सूतपुत्रस्य पृष्ठतः) 7. 6. 6-7;
(12) On the twelfth day, Śūrasenas and
others riding elephants, horses and chariots
along with their foot-soldiers in hundreds
and thousands stood at the ‘neck’ of the
Suparṇavyūha of Kauravas (ग्रीवायां शूर-
सेनाश् च … गजाश्वरथपत्त्यौघास् तस्थुः
शतसहस्रशः) 7. 19. 8; (13) On the
fourteenth day, ten thousand chariot-war-
riors of Śūrasenas and others, led by Jaya
and Kṛtavarman, tried to check the onward
march of Arjuna towards Jayadratha 7. 66.
37; later, when Sudakṣiṇa and Śrutāyudha
were killed, angered Śūrasenas and others,
showered arrows on Arjuna; he killed six
thousand of them; afraid, they fled, but
returned and surrounded Arjuna; Arjuna
cut off their arms and heads 7. 68. 2-5;
towards the end of the day, while lamenting
the death of Jayadratha, Duryodhana men-
tioned Śūrasenas among those who fought
for him but were killed by Arjuna (हता
मदर्थं संग्रामे युध्यमानाः किरी-
टिना) 7. 125. 31-32; (14) During the
night war between the fourteenth and the
fifteenth day, Yudhiṣṭhira and Bhīma killed
Śūrasenas 7. 132. 24; 7. 136. 4; (15) On
the seventeenth day, Kṛpa and others
fought with Śūrasenas (on Pāṇḍavas' side);
they fought a battle which led them to
heaven in case of death (तेषाम् अन्तकरं
 … स्वर्ग्यं यशस्करम्) 8. 32. 17-18;
(16) At night, on the seventeenth day
(निशि) while reporting the death of Karṇa
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (8. 1. 25-26) Saṃjaya
mentioned Śūrasenas among those who
were killed in war 8. 4. 36.

Śakas, Tukhāras, Kaṅkas and Romaśas,
who brought tribute for the Rājasūya of
Yudhiṣṭhira in the form of an अर्बुद horses
whose pedigree was noble and who went
long distances; they also brought gold in
crores totalling a पद्म; even then they
were stopped at the gate (शकास् तुखाराः

तथा) 6. 10. 52.

शौण्डिक
Śauṇḍika m. (pl.): Name of a people.
A. Epic event: Their chiefs (क्षत्रि-
याः) brought tribute in hundreds for the
Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira; at the instance of
the king, they were stopped at the gate by
the gatekeepers and were asked to give more
tribute; when each one of them further
gave elephants (their description 2. 48. 19-
20), they were allowed to enter (आहार्षुः
क्षत्रिया वित्तं शतशोऽजातशत्रवे। … तत्र

स्यथ॥) 2. 48. 15-16, 18-20 (Nī., Bom.
Ed. 2. 52. 19: reads कृतकालाः and expla-
ins the word as कृतप्रस्तावाः and remarks
कृतद्वारा इति पाठे द्वारम् प्रतीहारेण
सख्यम्।).
B. Their low social status:
Originally Kṣatriyas, Śauṇḍikas were de-
graded to the status of a वृषल due to
their disregard of Brāhmaṇas (तास् ताः
क्षत्रियजातयः।वृषलत्वम् अनुप्राप्ता
ब्राह्मणानाम् अदर्शनात्॥) 13. 33. 15.

highly skilled in fighting (युद्धे परम-
कोविदाः) 8. 4. 38.
B. Epic event: At
night of the seventeenth day (निशि 8. 1.
25), Saṃjaya, while reporting the death
of Karṇa to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, mentioned
Śreṇis among those who were killed in
thousands by Arjuna during the war
(श्रेणयो बहुसाहस्राः संशप्तकगणाश्
च ये।ते सर्वे पार्थम् आसाद्य गता
वैवस्वतक्षयम्॥) 8. 4. 38 (perhaps,
the word श्रेणि does not refer to a people
but means only ‘lines, rows of troops’ and
refers to Gopālas who, though not directly
mentioned are suggested by the expression
(गोकुले नित्यसंवृद्धाः) and by their
association with Saṃśaptakas, cf. Gopāla;
see, however, the next entry).

श्रेणिमत्|श्रेणिमन्त्
Śreṇimant m. (pl.): Name of a
people (?)
Their glorious Kṣatriyas of noble
birth, with weapons in hand, brought

वित्तं शतशो ऽजातशत्रवे॥) 2. 48. 16
(for other details of the tribute see Śau-
ṇḍika above). (Is Śreṇimant name of a
people or an adjective of Kṣatriyas mean-
ing ‘Kṣatriyas in troops’ ? See Sreṇi
above).

Śveta1 nt. (sg.): Name of a Varṣa of
Jambudvīpa.
It lay to the north of the Nīla Varṣa

सर्वेषाम् आश्रयभूतास् ताभिश् च युक्ता
देशकालौ येषां मुखमध्ये प्रविष्टाव्
इत्य् अर्थः।); with their tongues they lick
on all sides their faces which shine like
the sun (जिह्वाभिर् ये विष्वग् वक्त्रं लेलि-
ह्यन्ते सूर्यप्रख्यम्) 12. 322. 11. (Nī.

had the same lustre, no one more (nor less)
(न तत्राभ्यदिकः कश्चित् सर्वे ते सम-
तेजसः) 12. 323. 34; the lustre of the self-
luminous Bhagavān excelled the lustre of
the Śvetadvīpa (i. e. of the people living on
the Śvetadvīpa) (श्वेतद्वीपात् परं हि यत्।
तेज इत्य् अभिविख्यातं स्वयंभासावभासि-

12. 323. 24; (मद्भक्ताः) 12. 326. 18;
they lick the god with devotion (i. e. they

mode of devotion (जप) and offering बलि
as well as the result of their devotion and
offering described in 12. 323. 32, 36-41;
Nārada thought that Nara and Nārāyaṇa
(their description in 12. 331. 23-27) were
like the men he saw in the Śvetadvīpa
12. 331. 30; they are so blessed that if
one saw the people on the Śvetadvīpa
it was as good as seeing the god himself
(दृष्टो भवति देवेश एभिर् दृष्टैर् … ) 12.
323. 47; the people of Śvetadvīpa had
the same characteristic as that of the
liberated men (ये विमुक्ता भवन्तीह
 … तेषां लक्षणम् एतद् धि यच् छ्वेत-
द्वीपवासिनाम्) 12. 322. 14 (Nī. on 12.

eternal god of thousand lustres (ते सह-
स्रार्चीषं देवं प्रविशन्ति सनातनम्)
12. 323. 25; (मां प्रवेक्ष्यन्त्य् असं-
शयम्) 12. 326. 19.
D. Epic events:
(1) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Bhīṣma how
the people of the Śvetadvīpa were born
and what was the kind of life they were
going to obtain after death (कथं ते
पुरुषा जाताः का तेषां गतिर् उत्तमा) 12.
322. 13; thereupon Bhīṣma replied to his
question in details starting with the story
of king Uparicara 12. 322. 16 ff.; Bhīṣma
also told Yudhiṣṭhira how Nārada went to
Śvetadvīpa 12. 324. 39; (2) Janamejaya
asked Vaiśaṃpāyana why Nārada return-
ed from the Śvetadvīpa to the Badarī
आश्रम to see Nara and Nārāyaṇa, how
long he stayed there, and what were the
questions he asked to those two Ṛṣis 12.
331. 15-18; thereupon Vaiśaṃpāyana re-
plied to his question in details 12. 331. 19 ff.
E. Past events: (1) Nārada standing on
a peak of mountain Meru saw the Śveta-
dvīpa in the north-west direction as a
wonderful spectacle 12. 322. 7-8; Nārada
reached the Śvetadvīpa and saw the people
there; he respected them by bowing
down and they honoured him mentally
(पूजयाम् आस शिरसा मनसा तैश् च पूजि-
तः) 12. 325. 1-2; Bhagavān appeared
before Nārada, but told him to leave the
island immediately so that no disturbance
was caused to the contemplations of the
people of the Śvetadvīpa (गच्छ नारद
माचिरम्॥ … एकाग्राश् चिन्तयेयुर् मां
नैषां विघ्नो भवेद् इति) 12. 326. 17-18;
12. 331. 13; he left Śvetadvīpa and went
to mount Meru and from there to Gandha-
mādana to reach Badarī 12. 331. 20-22;
(also see the two epic events above);
Nārada told Nara and Nārāyaṇa that he
saw in Śvetadvīpa the people residing there
12. 331. 29-30; Nārāyaṇa asked Nārada if
he saw in Śvetadvīpa the Bhagavān who was
their (i. e. of Nara and Nārāyaṇa) higher
प्रकृति (अपि … स भगवान् … श्वेतद्वीपे
त्वया दृष्ट आवयोः प्रकृतिः परा) 12. 331.
35; Nārada replied that he did and also
told them he saw the white people who
were devoid of all sense-organs; as directed
by Bhagavān he returned from Śvetadvīpa
12. 331. 36, 41, 51; 12. 332. 1; Nara and
Nārāyaṇa then told Nārada that they too
had seen him (Nārada) meeting the Bhaga-
vān himself in Śvetadvīpa and had heard
his conversation with him (आवाभ्याम् अपि
दृष्टस् त्वं श्वेतद्वीपे … ।समागतो भग-
वता संजल्पं कृतवान् यथा॥) 12. 332.
22; (2) A noncorporeal voice told Ekata,
Dvita and Trita, who were practising severe
austerities on mountain Meru to go to
Śvetadvīpa where the Bhagavān had mani-
fested himself (गच्छध्वं तत्र) (i. e.
Śvetadvīpa) मुनयस् तत्रात्मा मे प्र-
काशितः) 12. 323. 21-23, 26; they reached
the Śvetadvīpa by following the way told
to them by the noncorporeal voice; having
reached the island, however, their eyes
were blinded and they could not see any
man (प्राप्य श्वेतं महाद्वीपं … ततो
नो दृष्टिविषयस् तदा प्रतिहतो ऽभवत्) 12.
323. 27-28; when Ekata, Dvita and Trita
further practised austerities for a hundred
years they were able to see the people of
the Śveta island; they had folded their
hands and, facing north-east, they did the
जप of Brahman; that जप was mental
(नित्याञ्जलिकृतान् ब्रह्म जपतः प्रागुदङ्-
मुखान्।मानसो नाम स जपो जप्यते
तैर् महात्मभिः॥) 12. 323. 32; suddenly
they saw lustre equal to that of a thousand
suns; the people of the island together be-
gan to run quickly, folding their hands and,
delighted, they continued to say ‘नमस्’;
when they were thus showing their reve-
rence, we heard a loud sound (ततो ऽभि-
वदतां तेषाम् अश्रौष्म विपुलं ध्वनिम्)
12. 323. 37; Ekata, Dvita and Trita were
not able to see anything, but they could
hear the praise of Bhagavān; at that time
wind blew heavenly flowers and plants
suitable for offerings; with that, people
gave offering to Hari (बलिः किलोपह्रियते
तस्य देवस्य तैर् नरैः); indeed, the god
himself had arrived there when they were
uttering sounds; from among those thou-
sands of men no one welcomed them
mentally, nor by looking at them; no one
thought of them and hence they were
worried (एतस्मिन्न् अन्तरे वायुः … दिव्यान्य्
उवाह पुष्पाणि कर्मण्याश् चौषधिस् तथा॥
 … चिन्ताव्याकुलितात्मानो जाताः स्मो … ।
मानवानां सहस्रेषु तेषु … ।अस्मान् न
कश्चिन् मनसा चक्षुषा वाप्य् अपूजयत्॥ …
नास्मासु दधिरे भावम्) 12. 323. 38-45;
a non-corporeal being then told them that
they had already seen the white people of
the island and that seeing them was as
good as seeing the chief god; they should
therefore quit the island without delay
(उवाच खस्थं किम् अपि भूतं तत्रा-
शरीरकम्॥दृष्टा वः पुरुषाः श्वेताः …
दृष्टो भवति देवेश एभिर् दृष्टैर् द्विजोत्त-
माः॥) 12. 323. 46-47; Bhagavān told
Nārada that Ekata, Dvita and Trita had
come to the Śveta island desirous of his
दर्शन, but they could not see him (इमं
देशम् अनुप्राप्ता मम दर्शनलालसाः)
12. 326. 11; (3) Vaiśaṃpāyana informed
Janamejaya that Nārada had told the
Sātvata धर्म to Vyāsa, which was, also
called the धर्म of the Ekāntins, followed
by the white ascetics (धर्मः सात्वतो … ।
एवं हि … नारदो गुरवे मम।श्वेतानां
यतीनाम् आह एकान्तगतिम् अव्ययाम्॥) 12.
336. 76, 78-79 (These ‘white ascetics’ are
probably to be identified with the people
of the Śvetadvīpa. Nī., however, on 12.
348. 85; श्वेतानां गृहस्थादीनाम्।यतीनां
काषायधारिणाम्).

B. Epic
events: (1) Saṃśaptakas took away
Arjuna from the main battle-field; after
Abhimanyu's death, Arjuna killed all the
surviving Saṃśaptakas—these two chief
points of the epic events mentioned while
listing the contents of the Droṇaparvan in
the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan 1. 2. 160, 163;
(2) Dānavas informed Duryodhana who
was taken to Rāsātala by a कृत्या that the
Saṃśaptakas were Daityas and Rākṣasas in
hundreds and thousands appointed to kill
Arjuna and they would kill him; then Dur-
yodhana felt assured that (Karṇa and) the
Saṃśaptakas were meant to kill Arjuna and
that they were capable of accomplishing
the task; the mind of the Saṃśaptakas was
under the spell of Rākṣasas and, overcome
by the qualities रजस् and तमस्, they were
eager to kill Arjuna (सांशप्तकाश् च ते
वीरा राक्षसाविष्टचेतसः।रजस्तमोभ्यां
आक्रान्ताः फल्गुनस्य वधैषिणः॥) 3.
240. 22, 30, 33; (3) Saṃjaya told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra that in the ensuing war the five
Kekaya brothers would take on the two
chief Trigartas of the Saṃśaptakas (त्रिगर्-
तानां च द्वौ मुख्यौ यौ तौ शंश-
प्तकाव् इति) 5. 56. 18; (4) An अयुत of
Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters were meant to
fight with Arjuna resulting either in the
death or victory of Arjuna; they followed
Arjuna wherever he went (संशप्तकानाम्
अयुतं रथानां मृत्युर् जयो वार्जुनस्येति
सृष्टाः।येनार्जुनस् तेन … प्रयाता वै ते)
6. 20. 15 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 6. 20. 15; येन
यत्र तेन तत्र); (5) Śuśarman, king of
Trigartas, and his five brothers Satyaratha,
Satyadharman, Satyavarman, Satyeṣuḥ and
Satyakarman together with their army of
Trigartas, as well as Mālavas, Tuṇḍikeras,
Mācellakas, Lalitthas, Madrakas and many
other Janapadas took the oath (शपथ)
to kill Arjuna 7. 16. 11, 15-21; the mode of
oath, also called प्रतिज्ञा, in which offerings
were given in fire, described 7. 16. 22-37;
in the description of the war, in the con-
text of Saṃśaptakas, besides some of those
groups of people mentioned above, also
occur Nārāyaṇas, Gopālas (7. 17. 31; 7. 18.
7), and Yaudheyas (7. 18. 16); (6) On
the twelfth day of the war, Droṇa planned a
battle between Arjuna and the Saṃśaptaka
troops and when Arjuna left the main battle-
field to fight with them, he arranged his
army in the Suparṇavyūha against Pāṇḍavas
(विधाय योगं पार्थेन संशप्तक-
गणैः सह) 7. 19. 2-4; the Saṃśaptakas
arranged their chariots on even ground
in the व्यूह called Candrārdha; they were
delighted to see Arjuna approaching them
for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was
surprised to find that they were delighted
when actually they should have been
grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were
delighted because they would go to excellent
worlds (after death) which were otherwise
difficult to be obtained by bad people 7.
17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta
conch blown by Arjuna, the army of
Saṃśaptakas became motionless; regaining
consciousness they started fighting with
Arjuna by showering कङ्कपत्रिन् arrows
against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle des-
cribed in which Subāhu, Sudharman and
Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22;
at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers,
afraid, ran towards the army of Duryo-
dhana 7. 17. 23; Suśarman, king of Tri-
gartas, rebuked those who fled; he remind-
ed them of their terrific oaths (शप्त्वा तु
शपथान् घोरान्); the troops of Saṃśap-
takas then blew their conches and returned
to fight till death (मृत्युं कृत्वा निवर्त-
नम्॥) 7. 17. 27-31; seeing that the troops
of Saṃśaptakas were returning Arjuna asked
Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards them;
he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3;
the Vāyavyāstra released by Arjuna to ward
off the arrows of the opponents also blew
away a large number of Saṃśaptakas along
with their chariots, horses, elephants and
weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of
Saṃśaptakas; their condition as well as the
condition of the battle-field described 7. 18.
22-37; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how
Arjuna dealt with the army of Saṃśaptakas
(संशप्तकबलं प्रति) and how did
they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left
Saṃśaptakas for a while to fight with
Bhagadatta who was routing the Pāṇḍava
army; fourteen thousand Saṃśaptakas
followed him and challenged him; Arjuna
hesitated for a while whether to fight with
Saṃśaptakas or go to help Yudhiṣṭhira;
ultimately he decided to kill Saṃśaptakas
(first) (अभवद् भुयसी बुद्धिः संश-
प्तकवधे स्थिरा); the great Saṃśaptaka
chariot-fighters (संशप्तकमहारथाः)
discharged numerous smooth arrows (शत-
सहस्राणि शराणां नतपर्वणां) on
Arjuna with the result that, covered with
the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kṛṣṇa, nor
his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when
Kṛṣṇa was deluded (मोहम् अनुप्राप्तः …
जनार्दनः) Arjuna killed Saṃśaptakas
with Vajrāstra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the
condition of Saṃśaptakas described 7. 26.
21-27; having killed Saṃśaptakas Arjuna
asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards
Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Suśarman and
his Saṃśaptaka brothers followed Arjuna
challenging him for a fight (युद्धार्थी
पृष्थतो ऽन्वयात्॥ … सुशर्माह्वयते
ऽच्युत॥); Arjuna therefore was again in
doubt-whether to kill Saṃśaptakas first
or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5;
he asked Kṛṣṇa to turn back and started
fighting with Suśarman; his battle with
Saṃśaptaka brothers described in which
Suśarman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later,
Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Saṃ-
śaptakas and Nārāyaṇas on the southern
side of the army (दक्षिणेन तु सेनायाः
कुरुते कदनं बलि।संशप्तकावशेषस्य
नारायणबलस्य च॥) 7. 30. 29; after
killing the Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna returned to
attack Droṇa and the Kaurava army 7. 31.
41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when
Droṇa reiterated the necessity of removing
Arjuna from the main battle, Saṃśapta-
kas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and
took him away to the south of the battle-
field (आह्वयन्न् अर्जुनं संख्ये दक्षिणाम्
अभितो दिशम्) 7. 32. 15; towards the end
of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his
camp after killing Saṃśaptakas 7. 50. 1-3;
Yudhiṣṭhira, grieved over the death of
Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left
to fight with the Saṃśaptaka army, Droṇa
made a serious attempt to capture him 7.
51. 1; (8) On the fourteenth day, at
the instance of Duryodhana, the army
of Kauravas, along with Saṃśaptakas,
returned to fight with Sātyaki with great
determination (ते पुनः संन्यवर्तन्त
कृत्वा संशप्तकान् मिथः) 7. 97. 12; when
Duḥśāsana was wounded by Sātyaki,
Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with
Sātyaki; Saṃśaptakas again made a deter-
mined effort to attack Sātyaki; Sātyaki
killed their five hundred chief warriors,
showering arrows on them, at the head of
the army (अग्रानीके व्यपोथयत्) 7. 99.
3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11;
ultimately they retreated in the direction of
Droṇa 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra
was told that on the sixteenth day, angry
Arjuna attacked the Saṃśaptaka troops
(संशप्तकगणान् 8. 9. 8) he wished to
know the details of the fight between Saṃ-
śaptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the
large ocean-like troops of Saṃśaptakas
(संशप्तकगणं … अर्णवसंनिभम्)
and agitated it (व्यक्षोभयत्); the fight
in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads
of his opponents with sharp arrows and
killed elephants and horses along with their
riders as well as chariot-fighters was hair-
raising (लोमहर्षणम्) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at
that point Aśvatthāman challenged Arjuna;
hence he asked Kṛṣṇa whether he should
continue killing Saṃśaptakas or accept the
challenge of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa drove
him to Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 21-22; after
fighting with Aśvatthāman, Arjuna return-
ed to Saṃśaptaka horse-riders, chariot-
fighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers
(ततः संशप्तकान् भूयः साश्वसूतरथ-
द्विपान्।ध्वजपत्तिगणान्) 8. 12. 36; battle
described in which Arjuna killed all kinds
of his opponents (संशप्तकमहार्णवम्।
व्यशोषयत दुःशोषम् … ) and returned
to fight with Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 37-43, 47;
after fighting for a while with him, Arjuna
came back to Saṃśaptakas; he cut off the
hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents
who did not turn back (अपराङ्मुखानाम्)
8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more
encounter with Aśvatthāman in which the
latter was removed from the battle by his
horses, Arjuna continued his battle with
Saṃśaptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was
loud noise to the north of the battle-field
(8. 13. 1), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to go
there and first fight with Māgadha Daṇḍa-
dhāra; he could later kill the Saṃśaptakas
8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed
Daṇḍadhāra and his elephant and came
back to Saṃśaptakas 8. 13. 25; in the
battle that followed, Arjuna killed many
Saṃśaptakas, while Kṛṣṇa drove his chariot
in various roundabout ways (वक्रानुव-
क्रगमनात्) 8. 14. 1; the battle described
8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kṛṣṇa advised
Arjuna not to while away his time with
Saṃśaptakas; he should kill them without
loss of time and hasten to kill Karṇa
(किं क्रीडसे ऽनघ।संशप्तकान् प्रम-
थ्यैतांस् ततः कर्णवधे त्वर); Arjuna
agreed and killed quickly the remaining
Saṃśaptakas (क्षिप्रं शिष्टान् संशप्त-
कांस् तदा।आक्षिप्य शस्त्रेण बलाद् …
अवधीत्) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with
Śālvas, Saṃśaptakas, and Nārāyaṇas, led
by the king of Trigartas and his brothers,
attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in
which Saṃśaptakas were killed by hundreds
and thousands (शतशो ऽथ सहस्रशः 8.
19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded
Arjuna and showered him with weapons,
described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost
the entire Saṃśaptaka army turned back
and did not stay to face Arjuna (प्रायशो
विमुखं सर्वं नावतिष्ठत संयुगे);
Arjuna thus won victory over many Saṃ-
śaptaka troops (संशप्तकगणान् बहून्)
8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth
day, thirty-four thousand chariot-fighters of
Śaṃśaptakas determined to fight to the end
stood on the left side of the Bārhaspatya-
vyūha of Kauravas (चतुस्त्रिंशत्सहस्राणि
रथानाम् अनिवर्तिनाम्।संशप्तका …
वामं पार्श्वम् अपालयन् … बार्हस्पत्यः
 … महाव्यूहः) 8. 31. 14, 26; Śalya
drew attention of Karṇa to Saṃśaptakas
who had challenged Arjuna; in response,
they were being attacked and killed by
Arjuna; angered Saṃśaptakas covered him
on all sides making Arjuna invisible
(संशप्तकैः क्रुद्धैः … छन्नः पार्थो
न दृश्यते) 8. 31. 56-57; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya to describe to him the
battle between Arjuna and Saṃśaptakas;
Saṃjaya told him that when the armies
were arrayed (अथ व्यूढेष्व् अनीकेषु),
Arjuna attacked Saṃśaptakas; wishing
to kill Arjuna and determined to win
victory not minding death (विजये कृत-
संकल्पा मृत्युं कृत्वा निवर्तनम्) they
rushed towards Arjuna; their army consi-
sted of many horses, elephants, chariot-
fighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle
then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands,
holding different weapons, as well as their
heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was
drowned in the large army, Saṃśaptakas
delightfully raised a roar (तस्मिन् सैन्ये
महावर्ते … ।निमग्नं तं रथं मत्वा
नेदुः संशप्तका मुदा।) 8. 32. 1-13; at
the site where Arjuna was killing Saṃśapta-
kas a loud sound of Gāṇḍīva was heard;
very much angered Saṃśaptakas, coveting
victory (जयगृद्धाः प्रमन्यवः) sho-
wered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved
their attack and reached Suśarman; when
Arjuna started showering arrows on Suśar-
man, Saṃśaptakas responded the same way;
hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's
chariot, the army of Saṃśaptakas was much
terrified and became motionless; regain-
ing consciousness, the warriors showered
arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot;
they held firmly the horses, the wheels and
the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared
loudly (ते हयान् रथचक्रे च रथेषाश्
चापि भारत।निगृह्य बलवत्); some
mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him
and Kṛṣṇa; shaking his hands Kṛṣṇa felled
them down; Arjuna saw Saṃśaptaka great
chariot-fighters encircling him and holding
his chariot and Kṛṣṇa; he felled many of
them down who had mounted the chariot
and other foot-soldiers who were close to
him by shooting arrows which went short
distances (अपातयत्।आसन्नांश् च ततो
योधाञ् शरैर् आसन्नयोधिभिः); he made
the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to
Kṛṣṇa that he had killed thousands of
Saṃśaptakas who had achieved the difficult
task of checking his chariot (कुर्वाणान्
दारुणं कर्म … रथबन्धं इमं।
घोरं); Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa blew Deva-
datta and Pāñcajanya conches respy.;
hearing that sound, the Saṃśaptaka army
shook and became very much afraid (सं-
चचाल … वित्रस्ता चाभवद् भृशम्);
Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing
नागास्त्र; he killed them in that condition;
when they were being killed, they gave up
fighting with Arjuna and threw down their
weapons; then Suśarman released them
from their bonds by using सौपर्णास्त्र;
once free, they showered arrows and
weapons on Arjuna (ससृजुर् बाणसं-
घांश् च शस्त्रसंघांश् च); Arjuna cut
off the missiles with arrows and killed many
elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by
using ऐन्द्रास्त्र; the troops of Saṃśaptakas
and Nārāyaṇas were then very much afraid;
no one was able to fight back Arjuna (न
हि कश्चित् पुमांस् तत्र यो ऽर्जुनं प्रत्य-
विध्यत); Arjuna then killed an अयुत of
the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand
(foot) warriors, an अयुत of chariot-
fighters, and three thousand elephant-
riders of Saṃśaptakas who survived (यानि
शिष्टानि) once again surrounded Arjuna
determined either to return with victory
or die (मर्तवयम् इति निश्चित्य जयं वापि
निवर्तनम्); a fierce fighting then was
fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37.
1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Saṃśapta-
kas; their Kṣatriyas, tormented by him,
were killed (ते क्षत्रिया दह्यमानास् …
जग्मुर् विनाशम्) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing
many Saṃśaptaka troops (निहत्य … सं-
शप्तकगणान् बहून्), Arjuna pointed out
to Kṛṣṇa the great Saṃśaptaka chariot-
fighters who along with their troops ran
away as they were unable to resist his
arrows (धावन्ति सगणाः संशप्तकमहा-
रथाः।अपारयन्तो मद्बाणान्) 8. 40. 78-
80; Duryodhana again incited Saṃśaptakas
to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariot-
fighters, three hundred elephant-riders,
fourteen thousand horse-riders and two
hundred thousand archers turned towards
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna covering them with
arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand
Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna
completely destroyed (कृत्स्नेन व्यध-
मत्) the Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 130; when
the armies of Kurus and Sṛñjayas met
again only a few Saṃśaptakas had sur-
vived (संशप्तकेषु … किंचिच्छिष्टेषु);
Arjuna, after defeating Aśvatthāman (8.
42. 51), asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Saṃ-
śaptakas since fighting with them was his
main task (कार्यम् एतत् परं मम) 8.
42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Saṃ-
śaptaka troops with sharp arrows with the
result that they became the guests of Indra
and became free from grief as they were
happy (शक्रस्यातिथिताम् गत्वा विशोका ह्य्
अभवन् मुदा) 8. 43. 76-77; when Arjuna
told Bhīma that he could not leave the
battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhi-
ṣṭhira) without killing Saṃśaptakas who
faced him, Bhīma assured him that he
himself would fight with the Saṃśaptakas
8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to
Yudhiṣṭhira why he had not yet killed
Karṇa told him that during his fight with
Saṃśaptakas, Aśvatthāman had unexpec-
tedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47.
2; later, while boasting about his heroic
deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed
almost all Saṃśaptakas and only a few of
them had survived (संशप्तकानां किंचिद्
एवावशिष्टम्) 8. 49. 96; at one stage, Duḥśā-
sana along with the fully equipped army of
Saṃśaptakas (पृतना समृद्धा) attacked
Bhīma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding
towards Karṇa, Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters
attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna
killed many of them along with their chari-
oteers, and cut off their bows and banners
with sharp arrows; they all fell down from
their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the
seventeenth day, at night, when Saṃjaya
reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa
(8. 1. 25), he (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), while recalling
some of the major events of war, mention-
ed the killing of the Saṃśaptaka army by
Arjuna 8. 1. 41; in reply to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's
question who of the Kurus were still alive
and who dead (के नु जीवन्ति के मृताः)
8. 4. 3, Saṃjaya mentioned Saṃśaptaka
troops (संशप्तकगणाश् च ये) among
those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4.
38; (12) On the eighteenth day, Arjuna
speedily rushed towards Kṛtavarman and
Saṃśaptaka troops which were posted on
the left side of the Sarvatobhadravyūha of
Kauravas 9. 7. 30, 19, 24 (where Saṃ-
śaptakas are designated as Trigartas);
Arjuna, having killed Saṃśaptakas in battle
(हत्वा संशप्तकान् रणे) rushed towards,
the army of Kauravas 9. 9. 59; as the
day advanced (मध्यंदिनगते सूर्ये),
Aśvatthāman, helped by Saṃśaptakas
(संशप्तकवृतो रणे), fought with Arjuna;
the battle was terrific in which a large
number of warriors were killed (तत्र
युद्धं महच् चासीत् … यमराष्ट्रविवर्-
धनम्) 9. 13. 42-43; (विमर्दस् तु महान्
आसीत्) 9. 13. 45; (13) On the nineteenth
day, after the war was over, Saṃjaya,
having returned early in the morning from
the camp (ततः पूर्वाह्णसमये शिबिराद्
एत्य संजयः 9. 1. 14), while reporting
to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the war-events mentioned
Saṃśaptakas among those who were killed
in war 9. 1. 26; Dhṛtarāṣṭra lamenting the
loss of life in war mentioned that many

वृद्धः … क्षत्रिया ये च सिन्धौ) 6. 20.
9-10; (5) On the second day of war,
Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras (सिन्धु-
सौवीराः), led by Śakuni, protected Droṇa
who was behind Bhīṣma in the Mahāvyūha
of Kauravas 6. 47. 10, 14; (6) On the
third day, Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras
(सिन्धुसौवीराः) were posted at the
‘neck’ position (ग्रिवायाम्) of the Garuḍa-
vyūha of Kauravas 6. 52. 2-3, 5; (7) On
the eighth dav, Irāvān, son of Arjuna,
attacked the Kaurava army with horses
of different countries some of them being
those from the Sindhu country (वाजिनाम्।
 … सिन्धुजानां च सर्वशः); the horses
were swift like wind (हयैर् वातजवैर् … )
6. 86. 3, 5-6; (8) On the thirteenth day,
Arjuna assured Kṛṣṇa that he would kill
the next day the Saindhava warriors along
with their kings (मया सराजका बाणैर्
नुन्ना नंक्ष्यन्ति सैन्धवाः) 7. 53. 48;
(9) On the fourteenth day, Yudhiṣṭhira
pointed out to Sātyaki that Arjuna, pro-
ceeding towards Jayadratha, was encircled
by the Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras
(संवृतः सिन्धुसौवीरैः) 7. 85. 73;
Sātyaki told Yudhiṣṭhira that Saindhavas
were no match for Arjuna (सैन्धव-
पौरवाः। … एते ऽर्जुनस्य क्रुद्धस्य
कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम्) 7. 86. 28-29; on
that day the Kaurava army which included
Sindhu warriors and Sauvīras ran helter-
skelter since they were being killed by the
arrows of Bhīma and Karṇa fighting each
other (ततो व्युदस्तं तत् सैन्यं सिन्धु-
सौवीरकौरवम्); they ran away from
them in all directions; the earth was covered
with their bodies along with their armours,
arrows and banners; when Karṇa saw the
destruction of the Kurus Sauvīras and Sain-
dhavas he was ablaze with anger (दृष्ट्वा
च कुरुसौवी रसैन्धवानां बलक्षयम्)
7. 113. 11-14; 7. 114. 17-18; (10) During
the night war (fourteenth-fifteenth day) all
Saindhavas and others, afraid, (simply)
watched Karṇa who alone could withstand
the shower of weapons released at him
by Ghaṭotkaca; they respected his compo-
sure in battle (असंमोहं पूजयन्तोऽस्य
संख्ये) 7. 154. 45; (11) After the war,
the women of Sindhu, Sauvīra and other
countries kept a watch on the dead body
of Jayadratha (सिन्धुसौवी रगान्धार-
काम्बोजयवनस्त्रियः) 11. 22. 11; (12)
When Arjuna reached the Sindhu country
along with Aśvamedha horse, the warriors
and their kings fought a fierce battle with
him; they encircled Arjuna so that he look-
ed like a bird moving in a cage (कोष्ठकी-
कृत्य कौन्तेयम् … अयोधयन्।स … ददृशे
 … पञ्जरान्तरसंचारी शकुन्त इव … ॥)
14. 76. 10, 13; Arjuna swooned for a
while due to the shower of the arrows of
Sindhu fighters (सैन्धवाः) 14. 76. 21-23;
when he recovered, he started showering
arrows so that the Saindhava warriors and
their kings could not be seen; the Sain-
dhavas were afraid due to the sound (of
the bow); they ran, wept due to sorrow
and lay down on the ground; the army (of
Saindhavas) was thus torn by Arjuna
(ततस् ते सैन्धवा योधाः सर्व एव
सराजकाः।नादृश्यन्त शरैः कीर्णाः … ॥
तस्य शब्देन वित्रेसुर् भयार्ताश् च विदु-
द्रुवः।मुमुचुश् चाश्रुशोकार्ताः सुषुपुश्
चापि सैन्धवाः॥ … सैन्यं विदार्य) 14.
76. 28-29, 32; the Saindhava warriors were
once again ready to fight with Arjuna and
they showered arrows at him; Arjuna told
them that he would not kill them if they
surrendered; but Saindhava warriors conti-
nued to shoot arrows; the kings of the
Sindhu country remembering the death of
Jayadratha threw प्रासस् and शक्तिस् on
Arjuna; he cut off their missiles before
they reached him; the warriors, desirous
of victory, continued their attack (आपत-
तां तेषां योधानां जयगृद्धिनाम्)
14. 77. 18; Arjuna cut off their heads; they
ran away but returned and although they
were being killed they fought with Arjuna
according to their vigour and energy
(यथाप्राणं यथोत्साहं योधयाम् आसुर्
अर्जुनम्) most of them, whose horses
were tired, swooned (कृता विसंज्ञा भू-
यिष्ठाः क्लान्तवाहनसैनिकाः); knowing
their plight, Duḥśalā, daughter of Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, took her grandson with her and
approached Arjuna wishing peace for the
surviving warriors (शान्त्यर्थं सर्व-
योधानाम्; शमार्थं सर्वयोधानाम्); she
requested him to cease fighting with Sain-
dhavas (शमं गच्छ धनंजय); thus
Arjuna defeated Saindhava warriors 14. 77.
2-43.
D. Past event: Vidurā exhorted
her son not to let himself be dispirited
and be under the control of the maidens of
Sindhu country (मा च सैन्धवकन्या-
नाम् अवसन्नो वशं गमः) 5. 132. 32;
she told him that she would honour him if
he was able to kill all Saindhava warriors
(अथ त्वां पूजयिष्यामि हत्वा वै सर्वसैन्-
धवान्) 5. 133. 19.

सौवीरात् प्रतिपत्तौ चेति पाठे प्रति-
पत्तौ विवाहकाले बभ्रोर् यादवस्य);
(2) When Jayadratha had started for the
country of Śālvas (3. 248. 6), heroic,
young warriors of Suvīra country accom-
panied him (सौवीरवीरा … युवानो … अनु-
यान्ति) 3. 249. 12; Koṭikāśya suggested to
Jayadratha to abduct Draupadī and return
to Suvīra country (सुवीरान् … व्रज) 3. 251.
6; Jayadratha invited Draupadī to be his
wife and obtain the mastery of the entire
Sindhu and Suvīra countries (अखिलान्
सिन्धुसौवीरान् अवाप्नुहि) 3. 251. 18; during
the battle with Jayadratha, Yudhiṣṭhira
himself killed in a moment a hundred of
excellent, attacking Suvīra warriors (राजा
स्वयं सुवीराणां प्रवराणां प्रहारिणां।
निमेषमात्रेण शतं जघान) 3. 255. 9;
Arjuna cut off with भल्ल arrows the bows
and heads of all the twelve Suvīra princes
(सौवीरका द्वादश राजापुत्राः 3. 249. 9)
accompanying Jayadratha (द्वादशानां तु
सर्वेषां सौवीराणां … ) 3. 255. 27; the
inmates of the आश्रम were happy to see
Yudhiṣṭhira return with Draupadī after
defeating the Sindhu and Suvīra warriors
(जित्वा तान् सिन्धुसौवी रान्) 3. 255. 50; (3)
The kings of Sindhu and Suvīra countries
(सिन्धुसौवीरवासिनः), led by Jayadratha,
joined the side of Duryodhana; their army
was an अक्षौहिणी strong (तेषाम् अक्षौहिणी
सेना) 5. 19. 14, 19-20; (4) In the arrange-
ment of the Kaurava army on the battle-
field, Sauvīras (सौवीराः) were among the
twelve Janapadas who formed the rear-
guard of Bhīṣma (पृष्ठगोपाः); they
offered protection to Bhīṣma with their
large number of chariot-fighters (महता
रथवंशेन) 6. 18. 10, 13-14; 6. 20. 14;
(5) On the second day of the war, Sindhu
and Suvīra warriors (सिन्धुसौवीराः) pro-
tected Droṇa who was behind Bhīṣma in
the Mahāvyūha of Kauravas (6. 47. 10-12,
14); protected by Suvīra warriors and
others, (प्राच्यसौवीरकेकयैः) Bhīṣma
attacked Arjuna 6. 48. 21; (6) On the
third day, warriors of the Sindhu and Suvīra
countries, along with others, were posted
at the ‘neck’ of the Garuḍavyūha of the
Kauravas (मद्रकाः सिन्धुसौवीरास् … ॥ …
ग्रीवायां संनिवेशिताः) 6. 52. 2-3, 5-6;
as directed by Bhīṣma, all Suvīra troops,
along with many others, quickly marched
towards Arjuna ( … सौवीरगणाश् च सर्वे
 … किरीटिनं त्वरमाणाभिसस्रुर् … ) 6. 55.
74; on that day Arjuna killed all Sauvīra
troops (सौवीरगणाश् च सर्वे) with his
Māhendra (or Aindra 6. 55. 110, 120)
missile 6. 55. 130; (7) On the fifth day,
the Sauvīra warriors (मद्रसौवीरगान्धा-
रैस्) and others, afraid due to the sound
of the Gāṇḍīva bow, took refuge with the
king of Kaliṅga country and then all
together attacked Arjuna (6. 67. 13, 16);
(8) On the sixth day, Bhagadatta, accom-
panied by the warriors of the Madra,
Sauvīra and Kekaya countries, stood at
the ‘chest’ position of the Krauñcavyūha
of Kauravas (मद्रसौवीरकेकयैः।उरस्य्
अभून् … ) 6. 71. 14, 18; (9) On the ninth
day, Sauvīra warriors (सौवीराः) were
among those who did not forsake Bhīṣma
although they were getting killed by sharp
arrows (6. 102. 7); (10) On the tenth day,
Sauvīra warriors (सौवीराः), emboldened
by Duryodhana (6. 112. 102, 105, 107)
attacked Arjuna; he burnt (ददाह) them
by the use of divine missiles; they then
stopped attacking Arjuna who forced
them to run away (द्रावयित्वा वरूथिनीम्)
6. 112. 108, 110-117; towards the end of
the day, when the Kuru army afflicted by
the arrows of Arjuna fled, Sauvīra warriors
(सौवीराः) were among those twelve Jana-
padas who, though afflicted by arrows and
feeling pain due to wounds (शरार्ता
व्रणपीडिताः) did not abandon Bhīṣma
while he fought with Arjuna 6. 114. 75-
77; (11) On the eleventh day, Karṇa led
the archers (प्रमुखे सर्वधण्विनाम्)
of the Śakaṭavyūha of Kauravas; Duryo-
dhana who followed him was at the head
of the Sauvīra warriors (सौवीराः), Kitavas
and others 7. 6. 7-8, 15; (12) On the
fourteenth day, the king of Avanti helped
by the Sauvīra warriors (आवन्त्यः सह
सौवीरैः) checked the advance of Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna towards Jayadratha 7. 70. 45, 51;
Yudhiṣṭhira, at one stage, drew attention
of Sātyaki towards Arjuna who was sur-
rounded by brave warriors of the Sindhu
and Suvīra countries, although their
number was very much diminished, using
sharp lances while fighting (सिन्धुसौवीरैर्
नखरप्रासयोधिभिः।अत्यन्तापचितैः
शूरैः) 7. 85. 73; but Sātyaki assured
Yudhiṣṭhira that the warriors of Suvīra
countries were not at all a match for
Arjuna once he was angry (ये च सौवीरका
योधास् … ।एते ऽर्जुनस्य क्रुद्धस्य कलां
नार्हन्ति षोडशीम्) 7. 86. 28-29; the army
of Kauravas which included warriors from
Sindhu, Suvīra and Kuru countries was
scattered by the swift arrows of both Karṇa
and Bhīma fighting with each other (ततो
व्युदस्तं तत् सैन्यं सिन्धुसौवीरकौर-
वम्।प्रोत्सारितं … ); afflicted by arrows
and with their horses and men killed and
chariots broken (हताश्वनरवाहनाः) they
left Bhīma and Karṇa and ran in all direc-
tions; thinking that the gods were deluding
them for the benefit of Bhīma (नूनं
पार्थार्थम् एवास्मान् मोहयन्ति दिवौ-
कसः) they stopped shooting arrows and
became spectators (शरपातं समुत्सृज्य
स्थिता युद्धदिदृक्षवः) 7. 113. 7, 11-14;
Karṇa was enraged to see the destruction
all around of the army of Kuru, Sindhu
and Suvīra countries (कुरुसौवीरसैन्ध-
वानां बलक्षयम् … सर्वतः), the dead
bodies of elephants, and the earth covered
with the armours, banners and weapons 7.
114. 17-18; (13) On the fifteenth day,
when Dhṛtarāṣṭra heard the death of Droṇa
he remembered that Sātyaki had formerly
defeated the large army of a king (not
named) of the Suvīra country (सौवीर-
राजस्य प्रमथ्य महतीं चमूं) 7.
9. 29; (14) When the war was over,
Gāndhārī, on the battle-field, pointed out
to Kṛṣṇa women of the Sindhu and Suvīra
countries who sat around the dead body
of Jayadratha keeping watch over him
(तम् एताः पर्युपासन्ते रक्षमाणा महा-
भुजम्।सिन्धुसौवीर° °स्त्रियः।) 11.
22. 9. 11.
E. Past events: (1) Vidurā
exhorted Saṃjaya not to be under the
control of the Sindhu maidens but live,
as before, feeling proud of being in the
company of the Sauvīra maidens (उष्य
सौवीरकन्याभिः श्लाघस्वार्थैर् यथा
पुरा।मा च सैन्धवकन्यानाम् अवसन्नो
वशं गमः॥) 5. 132. 32; (2) Ajabindu,
the king of the Suvīra people, mentioned by
Bhīma among those eighteen kings who,
born at the end of the aeon, extirpated their
kinsmen, friends and relatives (अष्टादशेमे
राजानः … ये समुच्चिच्छिदुर् ज्ञातीन् सु-
हृदश् च सबान्धवान्॥ … अजबिन्दुः …
सुवीराणां … । … यूगान्ते … संभूताः … )
5. 72. 11, 14, 17.

सुस्थर
Susthara m. (pl.): Name of a people.
Mentioned among many others who,
afraid of Jarāsandha, left the north and
resorted to the south (सुस्थराश् च सुकु-
ट्टाश् च … ॥; तथोत्तरां दिशं चापि परि-
त्यज्य भयार्दिताः। … दक्षिणां दिशम्
आश्रिताः॥) 2. 13. 25, 27.

सुह्म
Suhma m. (pl.): Name of a people.
A. Location: Listed by Saṃjaya
among the northern Janapadas (also called
Deśas 6. 10. 68) of Bhāratavarṣa (अत
ऊर्ध्वं जनोपदान् निबोध) 6. 10. 37,
5; (सुह्माश् च विजयास् तथा) 6. 10. 44;
the country of Suhmas lay to the north
of Hāstinapura (see
B. Epic events No. 2
below) and also to the east of Hāstinapura
beyond Magadha and Videha (see B. Epic
events No. 1. below); a part of it was near
the Aṅga country and the other near Vaṅga
and Tāmralipta; this latter part was, it
appears, designated eastern Suhma (Prācya-
suhma) (see B. Epic events No. 3 below).
B. Epic events: (1) After his marriage,
Pāṇḍu wishing to conquer the whole earth
(कृतोद्वाहः … जिगीषमाणो वसुधाम् 1. 105.
7) conquered the Magadha and the Videha
countries and then extended the fame of
Kurus as far as Kāśis, Suhmas and Puṇḍras
(तथा काशिषु सुह्मेषु पुण्ड्रेषु … । …
कुरूणाम् अकरोद् यशः॥) 1. 105. 12;
(2) Arjuna in his expedition to the north
(दिशं धनपतेर् इष्टाम् 2. 23. 9; प्रयाव्
उत्तराम् तस्माद् दिशम् धनदपालिताम् 2. 24.
1) before the Rājasūya harassed Suhmas
and Colas (सुह्मांश् च चोलांश् च … । …
प्रामथत् कुरुनन्दनः) 2. 24. 20; (3)
Bhīmasena in his expedition to the east
(ययौ प्राचीं दिशं प्रति 2. 26. 1; 2. 27.
9) defeated in battle Suhmas and Prācya-
suhmas; he defeated the king of Suhmas
(ततः सुह्मान् प्राच्यसुह्मान् … विजित्य
युधि कौन्तेयो … ॥सुह्मानाम् अधिपं
चैव) 2. 27. 14, 23 (Suhmas here distin-
guished as Suhmas and Prācyasuhmas);
(4) On the seventeenth day of war, at
night, when Karṇa's death was reported to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra (हते कर्णे महाराज निशि …
8. 1. 25; 8. 2. 20; 8. 5. 1) he remembered
Karṇa's past exploits one of which was
his having defeated the Suhmas and made
them pay tribute (सुह्मान् अङ्गांश् च …
यो जित्वा समरे वीरश् चक्रे बलिभृतः
पुरा) 8. 5. 19-20 (reference to Karṇa's
दिग्विजय before the Vaiṣṇavayajña of
Duryodhana 3. 241. 32; Cr. edn. Vol. 4.
App. 1. 24. 41-44; however, Suhma is not
directly mentioned here among the eastern
countries).

सृञ्जय
Sṛñjaya m. (pl.): Name of a people,
very likely a section of the Pāñcālas; some-
times they are almost identified with them,
but sometimes mentioned along with them
and/or with Somakas.
A. Description of their warriors:
Magnanimous (महात्मन्) 6. 85. 21; very
vigorous (महौजस्) 7. 132. 41; heroic
(वीर) 6. 68. 15; of great strength (महा-
बल) 6. 86. 76; 6. 103. 11; difficult to be
attacked (दुराधर्ष) 6. 103. 10; great
archers (महेष्वास) 6. 16. 42; 8. 40. 4;
great chariot-fighters (महारथ) 8. 40. 2;
tigers among men (पुरुषव्याघ्र) 7. 101.
51.
B. Epic events: (1) Bhīma told
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to
get back the kingdom by waging war
with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count
on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and
Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified
with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him
that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas
wish well of him and keep quiet (only he
and Draupadī got excited) (सर्वे ते प्रियम्
इच्छन्ति बान्धवाः सह सृञ्जयैः।अहम्
एको ऽभिसंतप्तो माता च प्रतिविन्ध्यतः॥)
3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it
was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their
share of kingdom before war broke out
in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by
Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5.
56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upa-
plavya, he asked him (Saṃjaya) to enquire
about the health of all including Sṛñjayas
(तेषां भागं … पुरा युद्धात् साधु तस्य
प्रदानम्॥ … अनामयं मद्वचनेन पृ-
च्छेः) 5. 22. 8-9, 38; (3) Sañjaya wanted
Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that
Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and the rest
of the assembled kings would live in happi-
ness (शमं कुर्या येन शर्माप्नुयुस् ते)
5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya to
communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were
also present 5. 25. 1; Saṃjaya appealed to
all of them to act in a way that would
lead to the well-being of Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas (कृताञ्जलिः शरणं वः प्रपद्ये
कथं स्वस्ति स्यात् कुरुसृञ्जयानाम्) 5.
25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there
could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas
when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had usurped the pro-
sperity of Pāṇḍavas (कथं स्वस्ति स्यात्
कुरुसृञ्जयानाम्।आत्तैश्वर्यो धृतराष्ट्रः
परेभ्यः।) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also
told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the
advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were cap-
able of controlling their enemies and de-
lighting their friends (सृञ्जयाश् … ।उपासीना
वासुदेवस्य बुद्धिं … ) 5. 28. 11; (4)
Saṃjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that
Arjuna wanted him to convey to the
Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana
would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna fighting at the head of the army
of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṃjaya that
their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in
astrology had predicted the destruction of
Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37,
93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who
could see and listen to the words of Kṛṣṇa
which were meant for the welfare of
Sṛñjayas (भारतीम् … शङ्करीं सृञ्जया-
नाम्) 5. 69. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 71. 2:
शंकरीं कल्याणकरीम्); (6) Kṛṣṇa
assured Yudhiṣṭhira that when he met the
Kauravas he would try to keep the agitated
Kurus and Sṛñjayas away from the noose
of death (मोचयेयं मृत्युपाशात् संरब्-
धान् कुरुसृञ्जयान्) 5. 70. 81; (7) Before
Kṛṣṇa left to meet the Kauravas, Drau-
padī told him that the Pāṇḍavas, along
with Sṛñjayas would be able to face the
army of Kauravas (शक्ष्यन्ति हि महाबाहो
पाण्डवाः सृञ्जयैः सह।धार्तराष्ट्र-
बलं … प्रतिसमासितुम्) 5. 80. 11 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 82. 11: प्रतिसमासितुं
प्रतिपक्षतया स्थातुम्); according to her,
severe punishment should be quickly in-
flicted on Kauravas by Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas
and Kṛṣṇa; he should take care to see
that he, along with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,
was not blamed for not killing one who
deserved to be killed 5. 80. 14, 18-19;
(8) Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura that he would
attempt to bring about reconciliation
between Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would
otherwise perish in war (संग्रामे विन-
शिष्यताम्) 5. 91. 8; (9) Duryodhana
wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong
did the Kauravas do to Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas or for what fault of Kauravas
did they want to kill Kauravas (किम् अस्मा-
भिः कृतं तेषां कस्मिन् वा पुनर् आगसि) 5.
125. 11; (10) When Ulūka was asked by
Yudhiṣṭhira to convey to the assembly the
view of Duryodhana, he spoke to them
who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas
5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryo-
dhana that in case of war Droṇa would
kill Sṛñjayas (गच्छेद् अन्तं सृञ्जयानाम्)
5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the
war, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana to pro-
tect Bhīṣma so that he might kill Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; seeing Bhīṣma at the
head of the Kaurava army, Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, shivered
(समकम्पन्त पाण्डवाः।सृञ्जयाश् च
 … धृष्टद्युम्नपुरोगमाः॥) 6. 16. 42;
(13) On the third day of the war, due to
the quickness of Bhīṣma's action, Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas felt that there were many
hundreds and thousands of him (अनेक-
शतसाहस्रम् समपश्यन्त लाघवात्) 6.
55. 22 (also cf. st. 21); (14) On the
fourth day, at one stage, Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas watched the duel between Bhīṣma and
Arjuna 6. 56. 28; (15) On the fifth day,
towards midday (मध्यन्दिनगते सूर्ये 6.
68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle
with Kurus in which arrows, शक्तिस्, तोमरस्
were used 6. 68. 15-16; the battle describ-
ed 18-19; the same day, later, Sṛñjayas,
when they lost their armours, and their
chariots were broken and bows were cut
off, and their hair dishevelled, they wrestled
with Kurus (बाहुभिः समयुध्यन्त) 6.
69. 39; when the sun was about to set
(सूर्ये ऽस्तम् उपगच्छति 6. 70. 34), and
when the stopping of the war was declared,
Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas, went to
their camps 6. 70. 37; (16) On the sixth
day, when Bhīṣma and Droṇa started killing
the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas
fied (पलायनपराभवन्) 6. 71. 32; (17)
On the seventh day, when Bhīṣma attack-
ed Yudhiṣṭhira, Sṛñjayas riding chariots,
elephants and horses trembled for they
feared Yudhiṣṭhira would soon be killed
(सरथनागाश्वाः समकम्पन्त सृञ्जयाः)
6. 82. 2-3; later in the afternoon (अपरां
दिशम् आस्थाय स्थिते सवितरि 6. 82. 28)
Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikha-
ṇḍin and attacked Sṛñjayas; they were
happy to face Bhīṣma (सृञ्जयास् तु ततो
हृष्टा … ) and raised loud roars and blew
their conches; a fierce battle followed in
which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders
mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28;
(18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started
killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they
attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñja-
yas not directly mentioned, only Pāñcālas
are mentioned); Bhīṣma cut off arms and
heads of those riding horses and elephants
and deprived the chariot-fighters of their
chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84.
3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and
Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their
army; the Kṣatriyas rolled on the ground
like those afflicted by ailments; their cry
was like one of those who become lean
due to hunger (विवेष्टन्तः स्म दृश्यन्ते
व्याधिक्लिष्टा नरा इव॥ … अनिशं श्रूयते
शब्दः क्षुत्कृशानां नृणाम् इव॥) 6. 85.
20-23; after the death of Irāvant, there
was fierce fighting in which the Kaurava
army and Sṛñjayas, not caring for their
lives in battle, killed one another; with
their hair loose and without their armours,
when they were deprived of their chariots
and their bows were cut off they wrestl-
ed with one another (जुह्वतः समरे
प्राणान् निजघ्नुर् इतरेतरम्॥मुक्तकेशा
विकवचा विरथाश् छिन्नकार्मुकाः।बाहु-
भिः समयुध्यन्त समवेताः परस्प-
रम्॥) 6. 86. 76-77; when Bhagadatta
proceeded to attack Yudhiṣṭhira, he fought
a severe battle with Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and
Kekayas who were ready to fight with their
weapons (उद्यतायुधैः) 6. 91. 79-80;
Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that since he had
dug up enmity with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
he should fight with them manfully; he him-
self also would kill Somakas and Pāñcālas
(which term includes Sṛñjayas) (युध्यस्व
तान् अद्य रणे … पुरुषो भव) 6. 94. 13-
15; (19) At the end of the ninth day,
it appeared that Bhīṣma had defeated
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; so at the start of
the night (रात्रिमुखे) Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis
and Sṛñjayas held consultation (मन्त्राय
समुपाविशन्) 6. 103. 8, 10-11; (20) At
the start of the tenth day, Kaurava army
was being destroyed by the sharp arrows
of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; hence, Bhīṣma,
not caring for life, attacked them 6. 104.
23, 26, 29; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
how on the tenth day Bhīṣma, when attack-
ed by Śikhaṇḍin determined to kill him
(6. 104. 45-46), fought with Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas (दशमे ऽहनि) 6. 105. 3; when
Bhīṣma began to destroy the Pāṇḍava army,
the great chariot-fighters (महारथाः)
of Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma to kill him
(वधायाभ्यद्रवन् भीष्मम्) 6. 105. 35;
as the war advanced Pāṇḍavas, backed
by Sṛñjayas (संहताः सह सृञ्जयैः),
attacked Bhīṣma 6. 110. 40; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
once again asked Saṃjaya how Bhīṣma
fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas on
the tenth day 6. 111. 1; as advised
by Bhīṣma, Arjuna led Sṛñjayas (and
Pāñcālas) to attack Bhīṣma and kill him;
Sṛñjayas were asked to attack Bhīṣma
without fear as they would be protected by
Bhīma and Arjuna 6. 111. 15-20; exhorted
by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas
attacked Bhīṣma showering weapons on
him (शस्त्रवृष्ट्या); angered Bhīṣma fought
with them 6. 113. 16-18; the weapons used
by Sṛñjayas are detailed in 6. 114. 2-3;
Sṛñjayas and Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar
when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 101; at the
end of the tenth day when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was
informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he
wondered who could be the warriors who
surrounded Bhīṣma (के वीराः पर्यवारयन्)
while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas
and Sṛñjayas; he also wished to know who
from among the Kauravas were on the
left side of the wheel of Bhīṣma and shot
arrows on Sṛñjayas (वामे चक्रे वर्तमानाः
के ऽघ्नन् संजय सृञ्जयान्) 6. 15. 25,
28, 32; (21) On hearing the death of
Bhīṣma (7. 2. 1), Karṇa admitted that the
army which included Pāṇḍavas, Sātyaki,
Kṛṣṇa and Sṛñjayas was invincible by kings;
7. 2. 31; (22) On the eleventh day,
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas met with arrows
Droṇa's attack on them; Droṇa broke and
scattered their army; agitated by the arrows
of Droṇa, they were again and again sca-
ttered by him (ते कम्प्यमाना द्रोणेन
बाणैः पाण्डवसृञ्जयाः।पुनः पुनर् अभ-
ज्यन्त) 7. 6. 33, 35, 41; Sṛñjayas, though
they tried, were not able to kill the army
of Droṇa as it was protected by him; since
Droṇa was acting very swiftly, Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas felt as if there were many Droṇas
(एकम् आशुकारिणम् आहवे।अनेकम् इव
संत्रासान् मेनिरे) 7. 12. 19, 23; Sṛñjayas
trembled seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning
the army of Pāṇḍavas (साक्षाद् अग्निम् इवो-
त्थितम्) 7. 13. 2; Sṛñjayas and others with
their weapons raised (उद्यतायुधाः) met
the attack of Aśvasena and others; a fierce
battle ensued 7. 15. 11-12; at the sunset
when the withdrawal of the Pāṇḍava army
was declared by Arjuna (स्वान्य् अनीकानि …
अवहारयत्), Sṛñjayas greeted him for his
deeds during the day 7. 15. 49-50; (23) On
the twelfth day, after killing Śatānīka, Droṇa
repeatedly defeated Sṛñjayas and others;
seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of
Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas trembled; due to the
heroism of Droṇa, a river carrying the
bodies of Kurus and Pāñcālas to the god
of death began to flow (नदीम् अन्तक-
गामिनीम्) 7. 20. 23-24, 34, 36; when Droṇa
killed a Pāñcāla prince, Sṛñjayas and others
attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill
Droṇa’ (हत द्रोणं हत द्रोणम् इत्य्
आसीत् तुमुलं महत्।); but Droṇa agitated
them who were very angry 7. 20. 48-49;
when Sṛñjayas and others were agitated and
were pushed back (चलितान् … प्रणुन्नान्)
by the arrows of Droṇa, Kauravas raised a
loud roar 7. 21. 7-8; Duryodhana drew
attention of Karṇa towards Bhīma who was
deserted by Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas
(हीनः पाण्डवसृञ्जयैः) 7. 21. 16; (24)
On the thirteenth day, Pāñcāla army which
included thousands of Sṛñjayas attacked
Droṇa; but Droṇa arrested their advance
with arrows; then Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas did
not attack him 7. 34. 5-7, 10; when Abhi-
manyu defeated Duḥśāsana, Sṛñjayas and
others were delighted 7. 39. 11, 17-18;
when Subhadrā heard the death of Abhi-
manyu, she pitied Sṛñjayas and the rest
who did not seem to know when Abhi-
manyu was felled down (धिक् केकयांस् …
सृञ्जयान्।ये त्वा रणे गतं वीरं न
जानन्ति निपातितम्) 7. 55. 13; (25) On the
fourteenth day, Sātyaki shot arrows at
Droṇa who was as though swallowing
(ग्रसन्तम् इव) Sṛñjayas 7. 72. 34; the
demon Alambusa made a river flow on the
battle-field carrying the dead bodies of
Sṛñjayas and others (नदीं प्रवर्तयाम्
आस) 7. 83. 30; when the Pāṇḍava army,
which included Sṛñjayas, attacked Droṇa
there was a loud roar among the Sṛñjayas
(तत्रारावो महान् आसीत्); when Droṇa
started killing them, Sṛñjayas found no
protector 7. 85. 20, 26; Yudhiṣṭhira assured
Sātyaki that when he (Sātyaki) would leave
to assist Arjuna, Sṛñjayas and others would
be there to protect him (Yudhiṣṭhira) 7.
86. 45; Sṛñjayas and others, thrilled, rushed
at Droṇa to fight with him with all their
might (सर्वशक्त्या); but Droṇa killed
them 7. 101. 50-52; Droṇa asked Duryo-
dhana to go to help Jayadratha; he himself
would obstruct the onward march of
Sṛñjayas and others 7. 105. 21; (26) After
the death of Jayadratha, before the start
of the night war between the fourteenth
and fifteenth day, Droṇa pointed out to
Duryodhana the armies of Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas marching towards him (Droṇa)
7. 126. 31; he directed Duryodhana to hold
back his army if he could, for Kurus and
Sṛñjayas would continue to fight even dur-
ing the night; with these words, Droṇa mar-
ched against Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas (त्वं
च दुर्योधन बलं यदि शक्नोषि धारय)
7. 126. 38-39; then, there was fierce fighting
in the evening (संध्यायाम्) all around
between Droṇa and Sṛñjayas 7. 129. 18;
when the fierce fighting progressed during
the night, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas together
attacked Droṇa (रात्रियुद्धे तथा घोरे
वर्तमाने सुदारुणे); Droṇa forced all
of them back killing some of them (तान्
सर्वान् विमुखांश् चक्रे कांश्चिन् निन्ये
यमक्षयम्) 7. 129. 34-35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya how did Kauravas feel
when Droṇa entered the (army of) Sṛñjayas
(का वो ऽभूद् वै मतिस् तदा) 7. 130. 1;
Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas followed Bhīma and
Arjuna who showered arrows on Droṇa
trying to scatter the army of Drupada with
Vāyavyāstra 7. 132. 37, 41; 7. 136. 14;
Aśvatthāman challenged his opponents to
attack him and then killed Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas; they abandoned Aśvatthāman and
fled in all directions (व्यद्रवन्त दिशो दश
7. 135. 19) when their chariots and banners
were scattered (विप्रकीर्णरथध्वजाः) 7.
135. 51; Duryodhana asked Duḥśāsana and
his other brothers to offer protection to
Droṇa who would then kill Sṛñjayas and
their kings (सृञ्जयांश् च सराजकान्); when
all Sṛñjayas were killed, Aśvatthāman would
kill Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 139. 24-25; in the
fighting that followed Aśvatthāman cover-
ed Drupada and Droṇa covered Sṛñjayas
with smooth arrows (छादयाम् आसतुः
संख्ये शरैः संनतपर्वभिः) 7. 139.
31; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fight-
ing with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas
raised a loud roar (सिंहनादं प्रच-
क्रिरे) 7. 141. 32; considering that Bhīma
had killed Duryodhana, Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas
and others made all effort to attack Droṇa
to fight with him (सर्वोद्योगेनाभिजग्मुर्
 … ); a fierce battle then was fought 7.
141. 60; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were
being killed by Karṇa, they apprehended
his presence nearby even when a blade of
grass stirred (तृणप्रस्पन्दनाच् चापि सूत-
पुत्रं स्म मेनिरे) 7. 148. 15 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 7. 173. 19: अतिभयात् तृणचलन-
मात्रेणापि कर्णं प्राप्तं मेनिरे); they
mistook a running warrior on their own
side to be Karṇa (अपि स्वं समरे योधं
धावमानं विचेतसः।कर्णम् एवाभ्य-
मन्यन्त … ); hence, afraid, they ran
but Karṇa attacked them from behind
(पृष्ठतो विकिरञ् शरान्) 7. 148. 15-17;
when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were excessi-
vely tormented by the Rākṣasas of Alā-
yudha they had no peace of mind (न
शान्तिं लेभिरे तत्र) 7. 152. 31; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra wondered why Karṇa, instead of
killing Ghaṭotkaca, did not kill Arjuna
with the शक्ति given to him by Indra; for,
the death of Arjuna would have meant the
death of all Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas long
ago 7. 157. 2; the same opinion was held
by Kṛṣṇa (and hence he deluded the mind
of Karṇa whenever he faced Arjuna) 7.
157. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how
did Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas with their armies
arrayed and in striking position (व्यूढानी-
काः प्रहारिणः) fight with Kurus and how
did they attack Droṇa who, not caring for
his life, had plunged into their army after
the death of Ghaṭotkaca (जीवितं त्यक्त्वा
गाहमानं वरूथिनीम्) 7. 158. 13-15;
Droṇa killed three grand-sons of Drupada
and then defeated Cedis, Kekayas, Sṛñjayas
and Matsyas 7. 161. 31-32; (27) On
the fifteenth day, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas,
although they were being killed by Droṇa,
attacked him and confused him (मोहयन्तो
महारथम्) 7. 164. 60; after killing Vasu-
dāna (king of Pāṃśurāṣṭra), Droṇa killed
six thousand Sṛñjayas 7. 164. 85; exhorted
by Yudhiṣṭhira to assist Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the
great chariot-fighters of Sṛñjayas attacked
Droṇa in order to kill him; Droṇa with
great speed moved against them not mind-
ing his death (मर्तव्यम् इति निश्चितः);
bad omens occurred; Droṇa, encircled by
the armies of Drupada, moved burning
host of Kṣatriyas and killed a very large
number of them 7. 165. 8-16; when ulti-
mately Droṇa was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas attacked the dis-
heartened Kurus with the result that their
army was shattered (निरुत्साहान् कुरून्
 … अभ्यद्रवन् … ततः सैन्यं व्यदीर्-
यत) 7. 165. 58; when Aśvatthāman
used his नारायणास्त्र, Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas
and Sṛñjayas were dismayed to see the
mid-region filled with different weapons
(शस्त्राकृतिभिर् आकीर्णम् अतीव … दृष्ट्वा-
न्तरिक्षम् आविग्नाः पाण्डुपाञ्चालसृञ्जयाः)
7. 170. 20; at the end of the day, when
Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
death of Droṇa, he asked Saṃjaya what
was Droṇa doing on the battle-field
when Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas managed
to kill him (किं कुर्वाणं रणे द्रोणम्
जघ्नुः पाण्डवसृञ्जयाः) 7. 8. 1; Saṃjaya
assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that since he was an
eye-witness to the whole event (सर्वं
प्रत्यक्षदर्शिवान्) he would narrate to him
how Droṇa fell when overpowered (सादितः)
by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 7. 11. 1; (28)
On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana was
confident that with Karṇa as their general
Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas would
loose their consciousness (गतचेतसः) 8.
6. 31; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that
Karṇa, as intended by Aśvatthāman (अश्व-
त्थामनश् च संकल्पाद् … ) had killed
Sṛñjayas 8. 16. 5; Karṇa brought Sṛñjayas
and Pāñcālas within the range of his arrows
and crushed them (शरगोचरम् आनयत्।
ममर्द); Kurus, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
fought with great effort not caring for
their life (व्यायच्छमानाः सुभृशम् …
प्रियान् असून् रणे त्यक्त्वा) 8. 16. 22, 24-
25; battle described 8. 16. 26-38; at mid-
day (मध्यं गते दिनकरे 8. 17. 100),
although Karṇa killed Sṛñjayas they attack-
ed him 8. 17. 117; (29) On the seven-
teenth day, early morning (प्रभातायां
रजन्यां तु 8. 22. 29) before the start of
the war, Duryodhana while requesting Śalya
to act as a charioteer of Karṇa told him
that with a good charioteer like him, Karṇa
would be able to destroy Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcā-
las and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; at the start of
the war on that day, Pāñcālas, Cedis and
Sṛñjayas fought a fierce battle with the
Kaurava army 8. 32. 15; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
remembered that Karṇa had boasted earlier
that he alone would kill Sṛñjayas along
with Pāṇḍavas 8. 35. 2; Sṛñjayas cut off
(शातयाम् आसुः) the arrows shot at them
by Kṛpa 8. 38. 4; Karṇa stopped the on-
ward march of Sṛñjayas and others who
were led by Bhīma 8. 38. 16; Karṇa killed
Cedis, Karūṣas and Sṛñjayas in the presence
of Bhīma; when Bhīma left Karṇa to fight
with the Kuru army, Karṇa killed thou-
sands of great archers of Sṛñjayas (सृञ्-
जयांश् च महेश्वासान् निजघान सहस्र-
शः) 8. 40. 2-4; Sṛñjayas were ‘burnt’ by
the fire in the form of Karṇa (कर्णाग्निना
 … दग्धा … ) 8. 40. 61; Arjuna pointed out
to Kṛṣṇa that the large army of Sṛñjayas
was being scattered (दीर्यते) by Karṇa
8. 40. 81; when Bhīma returned to fight
(संनिवृत्तो रणं प्रति), Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed
him 8. 41. 3; Kurus led by Karṇa and
Sṛñjayas led by Yudhiṣṭhira faced one
another without fear (अभीताः) 8. 42. 1;
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa,
after defeating Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas was looking for Arjuna: when
the Kuru warriors saw Karṇa displaying
his valour by harassing Pāṇḍavas and
thousands of Sṛñjayas they raised a loud
roar (नदन्ति); Karṇa encouraged Kau-
rava warriors to attack Sṛñjayas so that
none of them escaped alive (यथा जिवन्
न वः कश्चिन् मुच्यते) 8. 43. 36; Kṛṣṇa
was glad to point out to Arjuna that Bhīma,
along with Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas, had once
again returned to the battle-field 8. 43. 52;
Yudhiṣṭhira wondered whether the en-
counter of Sṛñjayas and Kauravas in which
he was humiliated had become known to
the fighters (कच्चित् संग्रामे विदितो वा
तदायं समागमः सृञ्जयकौरवा-
णाम्।यत्रावस्थाम् ईदृशीं प्रापितो ऽहम्)
8. 46. 41; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that all
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with their followers
were prepared to fight when they had
resorted to him (एते च सर्वे पाञ्चालाः
सृञ्जयाश् च सहान्वयाः।त्वां समासाद्य
 … व्यवस्थिताः) 8. 51. 5; while taking
stock of some of the events of the battle
which had lasted for seventeen days (अद्य
सप्तदशाहानि 8. 51. 2), Kṛṣṇa reminded
Arjuna that while Bhīṣma was fighting,
Sṛñjayas were unable to look at him;
Bhīṣma routed Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
and distinguished himself as the sole
war hero (एकवीरत्वम् आगतः) 8. 51. 35;
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Bhīma,
covered on all sides by Sṛñjayas, was
being tormented while fighting with Karṇa:
if Karṇa was neglected he might kill
Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas 8. 51.
105-106; at one stage in the battle, Utta-
maujas had engaged Sṛñjayas 8. 53. 6;
Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot
towards Karṇa, lest he destroyed all Sṛñ-
jaya great chariot-fighters in battle in their
presence (राधेयो ऽप्य् अन्यथा पार्थान्
सृञ्जयांश् च महारथान्।निःशेषान्
समरे कुर्यात् पश्यतोर् नौ जनार्दन॥)
8. 57. 8; later, Kuru warriors and Sṛñjayas
fought with one another using straight-
flying and very sharp arrows (शरैस्
तदाञ्जोगतिभिः सुतेजनैः) 8. 57. 67; once
again a very severe fighting broke out
between Kurus and Sṛñjayas in which they
used besides arrows weapons like swords,
शक्तिस्, lances, maces and परश्वधस् 8.
62. 40; when Karṇa was killed, Arjuna was
honoured by Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others
8. 69. 37; on the seventeenth night (निशि 8.
1. 25) while reporting Karṇa's death to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra Saṃjaya told him that Karṇa,
before his death, had killed Kekayas and
Videhas in the presence of all Sṛñjayas
and Pāñcālas (स सृञ्जयानां सर्वेषां
पाञ्चालानां च पश्यताम्।केकयानां
विदेहानाम् अकरोत् कदनं महत्॥) 8. 2.
18; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya who among
the Kurus and Sṛñjayas were dead and who
were alive 8. 4. 3; (30) On the eighteenth
day, when Śalya became the general the
Madras encouraged him saying that he
was capable of defeating in battle even
gods and demons, let alone mortals like
Somakas and Sṛñjayas 9. 6. 9; a fierce battle
was fought by Sṛñjayas with Kurus which
terrorized Kurus (कुरूणां भयवर्ध-
नम्) 9. 8. 1; as a result of the battle
there began to flow a terrific river (नदी
रौद्रा) filled with the bodies of Kurus
and Sṛñjayas (कुरुसृञ्जयसंकुला) 9. 8.
32; seeing the heroic deeds (विक्रमम्) of
Śalya, Duryodhana considered Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas (as good as) dead
(निहतान् … मेने) 9. 12. 28; finally, when
Śalya was killed, Pāṇḍavas and Śṛñjayas
chased the shattered (प्रभग्नान्) army
of Kauravas 9. 18. 28; when Śālva, riding
an elephant, attacked the Pāṇḍava army,
Sṛñjayas and others thought his swiftly
moving single elephant, to be several
thousands (सहस्रशो वै विचरन्तम्
एकम्) 9. 19. 6; when the Pāṇḍava army
was broken, Kaurava heroes blew, in joy,
their conches; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the general
of the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,
could not bear the sound of the roar indi-
cative of the joy of Kauravas (8. 19. 10);
seeing the (heroic) deeds of Śālva, Sṛñjayas
and others encircled his elephant 9. 19. 21;
during the war of eighteen days eleven
अक्षौहिणिस् of Duryodhana's army were
killed by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 9. 28.
14; Duryodhana felt confident to defeat
Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with
mace as his weapon 9. 31. 30; Bhīma
told Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by Sṛñjayas
(सृञ्जयैः सह तिष्ठन्तम्), that he was
prepared to accept the challenge of Duryo-
dhana 9. 32. 28; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas
applauded Duryodhana's words asking
Bhīma to prove his words (दर्शयस्व
बलं युद्धे) 9. 32. 49-50; when Balarāma
came to witness the duel between Bhīma
and Duryodhana, he embraced Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas and enquired about their
well being (अपृच्छत् कुशलं सर्वान्) 9.
33. 11; Duryodhana asked Yudhiṣṭhira,
along with Sṛñjayas, to watch the duel
9. 54. 38-39; when Duryodhana was forced
to kneel down by Bhīma, Sṛñjayas raised
a loud roar; hearing their roar, Duryo-
dhana was enraged 9. 56. 54-55; when
Bhīma felled down Duryodhana he told
Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas that he
had killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra on
the strength of Draupadī's तपस् (रणे
हतांस् तपसा याज्ञसेन्याः) 9. 58. 9-10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya what did the
Sṛñjayas do when Duryodhana was struck
down; Saṃjaya told him that they waived
their upper garments and raised a loud
roar; the earth was unable to bear them
who were filled with delight (आविध्यन्
उत्तरीयाणि सिंहनादांश् च नेदिरे।नैतान्
हर्षसमाविष्टान् इयम् सेहे वसुन्धरा॥)
9. 60. 3-4; some shook their bows, others
their bow-strings; still others blew their
large conches or struck the दुन्दुभिस्; some
made sportive gestures, others laughed
(चिक्रीडुस् तथैवान्ये जहसुश् च) 9. 60.
5-6; they praised Bhīma's act in so many
words and were happy that he had brought
the enmity to an end (वैरस्य च गतः
पारम्); they said that the horripilation
experienced by them at the time of Duryo-
dhana's fall had not yet subsided (दुर्यो-
धनवधे यानि रोमाणी हृषितानि नः।अद्यापि
न विहृष्यन्ति तानि … ) 9. 60. 7-16; Kṛṣṇa
told Sṛñjayas not to rebuke Duryodhana
anymore because he was already killed when
he refused to give Pāṇḍavas their share
although advised to do that, among others,
by them (°गाङ्गेवसृञ्जयैः। … प्रोच्य-
मानो ऽपि) 9. 60. 20; (31) During the
massacre which took place at night of the
eighteenth day, Aśvatthāman killed Pāṇḍava
warriors and Sṛñjayas who were without
weapons and armours and were agitated
(अपेतशस्त्रसंनाहान् संरब्धान् पाण्डु-
सृञ्जयान्) 10. 8. 74; Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman
told Aśvatthāman that they had killed
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas by thousands (as
they were trying to escape from the camp)
(विनिकृत्तान् सहस्रशः) 10. 8. 141; (32)
More than a hundred Sṛñjayas (सृञ्जयांश्
च शताधिकान्) were put on the funeral
pyre along with the dead bodies of other
fallen heroes and were cremated according
to the prescribed rites 11. 26. 30, 33, 38.
C. Some person referred to as Sṛñjayas
which indicated their relationship with
them: (1) Dhṛṣṭadyumna 3. 34. 12 (cf. 3.
23. 46); (2) Hotravāhana (father of
Ambā's mother) 5. 175. 7, 12, 28; 5. 176.
4, 17, 20, 26; (3) Vainya, one of the
ancient kings 1. 1. 166.

B. Epic events: (1) Recounting the war
events to Saṃjaya, Dhṛtarāṣṭra said that
before Bhīṣma's fall he had reduced Soma-
kas to a small number (कृत्वा सोमकान्
अल्पशेषान्) 1. 1. 127; (2) At the start of
the स्वयंवर of Draupadi, the priest of
Somakas (in such contexts they are identi-
fied with Pāñcālas) gave offerings in fire,
asked Brāhmaṇas to pronounce benediction
(ब्राह्मणान् स्वस्ति वाच्य च) and then
stopped the sound of musical instruments
1. 176. 31-32; (3) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya how strong Somakas were with
Dhṛṣṭadyumna as their general (धृष्ट-
द्युम्नेन सेनान्या सोमकाः किम्बला इव)
5. 49. 9; (4) Duryodhana and others
thought that if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Pāṇḍa-
vas and Somakas would give up all their
effort (निरुद्यमा भविष्यन्ति) 5. 128. 7;
(5) When Pāṇḍavas had settled down at
Hiraṇvatī, Duryodhana sent Ulūka as his
messenger to them and Somakas 5. 157.
3; (6) Bhīṣma had assured Duryodhana
that he would kill Pāṇḍavas and Somakas
5. 170. 2; (7) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
how did Kurus and Pāṇḍava-Somakas
fight with one another at Kurukṣetra;
thereupon Saṃjaya described to him how
they fought when Somakas, determined to
win or die while engaged in fighting, attack-
ed Kauravas (आशंसन्तो जयं युद्धे
वधं वाभिमुखा रणे) 6. 1. 1-4; Kau-
ravas and Pāṇḍava-Somakas sat together
before the start of the war and mutually
agreed upon certain conventions and
rules to be followed in the war (ततस् ते
समयं चक्रुः कुरुपाण्डवसोमकाः।
धर्मांश् च स्थापयाम् आसुर् युद्धानाम्
 … ॥) 6. 1. 26, 33; the conventions and
rules detailed in 6. 1. 27-32; (8) Duryo-
dhana told Duḥśāsana that if Bhīṣma was
protected in war he would kill Pāṇḍavas,
Somakas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; (9) When
Arjuna got prepared for the war Somakas
and others blew their conches 6. 41. 2;
(10) On the second day of the war,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Somakas showered
arrows on Droṇa 6. 48. 30; (11) On the
third day, Kṛṣṇa noticed Bhīṣma routing
Somakas chased by the delighted Kauravas
(प्रभग्नान् दृश्य सोमकान्) 6. 55. 68;
(12) On the fifth day, when Bhīṣma
started killing Pāñcālas and Somakas, they
acted nobly and decided to attack Bhīṣma
(आर्यां युद्धे मतिं कृत्वा भीष्मम्
एवाभिदुद्रुवुः) 6. 68. 31; (13) On the
sixth day, Śikhaṇḍin surrounded by Soma-
kas and Irāvant stood at the ‘tail’ of
the Makaravyūha of Pāṇḍavas (पुच्छे
मकरस्य) 6. 71. 4, 11; Somakas were
terrified (वित्रेसुः) to hear the sound of
Droṇa's conch when he blew it after defeat-
ing Drupada 6. 73. 46; (14) On the eighth
day, when the Pāṇḍava army attacked
Bhīṣma he killed Pāñcālas, Somakas and
Sṛñjayas with his arrows; nevertheless,
abandoning the fear of death they attacked
Bhīṣma (त्यक्त्वा मृत्युकृतं भयम्)
6. 84. 2-4; battle that ensued, in which
Bhīṣma cut off their hands and heads and
felled down those riding chariots, horses
and elephants (विरथान् रथिनश् चक्रे;
हयेभ्यो हयसादिनाम्; निर्मनुष्यांश् च
मातङ्गाञ् … ), described in 6. 84. 5-7;
when Droṇa attacked Somakas and Sṛñjayas
in order to kill them (अभ्यद्रवत …
प्रेषयिष्यम् यमक्षयम्) a loud cry was
raised by Sṛñjayas (by implication also by
Somakas) (तत्राक्रन्दो महान् आसीत् सृञ्ज-
यानाम्) 6. 85. 20-21; that night, Karṇa
assured Duryodhana that he would kill all
Pārthas and Somakas if Bhīṣma laid down
his arms and left the battlefield 6. 93. 13;
Duryodhana then went to Bhīṣma and
reminded him that he had assured him
(Duryodhana) to kill Somakas; he asked
Bhīṣma to carry out his assurance by killing
Somakas 6. 93. 37-38; thereupon Bhīṣma
once again assured Duryodhana that next
day he would either kill Somakas and Pāñ-
cālas to delight him or they would kill
him (तैर् वाहं निहतः संख्ये गमिष्ये
यमसादनम्।तान् वा निहत्य संग्रामे
प्रीतिम् दास्यामि वै तव॥) 6. 94. 14-15;
(15) On the ninth day, in the morning,
Duryodhana asked the kings to get ready
with their armies since Bhīṣma was going
to kill that day Somakas (अद्य भीष्मो …
निहनिष्यति सोमकान्) 6. 95. 1; at mid-day,
Bhīṣma fought a fierce battle with Somakas
blowing them away by hundreds and thou-
sands with his sharp arrows (व्यधमन्
 … शतशो ऽथ सहस्रशः) 6. 99. 1-2;
in the evening when the sun had set
(भास्करे ऽस्तम् उपागते 6. 103. 1), Yudhi-
ṣṭhira seeing that great chariot-fighters
among Somakas had been defeated and
had lost enthusiasm (जितान् दृष्त्वा … निरुत्-
साहान् महारथान्) felt like ordering
cessation of hostilities for that day (अव-
हारम् अरोचयत्) 6. 103. 4; (16) Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how, on the tenth
day, did Bhīṣma face Pāṇḍavas while at
the same time killing Somakas 6. 104. 25;
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, aided by Somakas, attack-
ed Droṇa 6. 111. 30; Bhīṣma, when attack-
ed by Śikhaṇḍin, killed Somakas who
followed Arjuna (पार्थपदानुगान्) 6.
112. 64; none of the great chariot-fighters
of Somakas hoped to live after facing
Bhīṣma in battle (न … यः संप्राप्य रणे
भीष्मं जीविते स्म मनो दधे) 6. 112.
75; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas
and Sṛñjayas rushed at Bhīṣma showering
weapons on him from all sides (अभ्यद्र-
वन्त … शस्त्रवृष्ट्या समन्ततः) 6. 113.
16-17; Somakas and Pāñcālas were delight-
ed when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 107;
(17) On the fourteenth day, when Droṇa
started killing Somakas no one succeeded
in facing him, nor was any one able to
pierce him (with an arrow) (न चाप्य-
भिययुः केचिद् अपरे नैव विव्यधुः) 7.
85. 34; watching the fierce duel between
Satyasena and Sātyaki, Kauravas and
Somakas praised them 7. 94. 7; in the
afternoon of that day, Droṇa again fought
with Somakas (अपराह्णे … संग्रामः
समपद्यत। … पुनर् द्रोणस्य सोमकल्ः)
7. 101. 1; when the different alignments of
the Pāṇḍava army were being agitated by
Droṇa (व्यूहेष्व् आलोड्यमानेषु), Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Somakas went deep into the
army of Kauravas (सुदूरम् अन्वयुः); the
battle fought was so fierce that it looked
like the end of the world (युगान्त इव
भारत) 7. 102. 1-2; when Bhīma
marched to offer assistance to Arjuna,
Pāñcālas and Somakas followed him 7.
102. 67; after the death of Jayadratha, in
the evening (अस्तं गच्छति भास्करे),
Droṇa fought a fierce battle with Somakas
(सोमकैः सार्धम् संग्रामो लोमहर्ष-
णः); at that time great chariot-fighters
of Somakas made every attempt to kill
Droṇa (ते तु सर्वे प्रयत्नेन भारद्वाजं
जिघांसवः। … अयुध्यन्त महारथाः॥)
7. 121. 45-46; Droṇa sent a message to
Aśvatthāman through Duryodhana not to
spare Somakas in order to save his own
life (न सोमकाः प्रमोक्तव्या जीवितं
परिरक्षता) 7. 126. 33; (18) In the
night war (which took place between the
fourteenth and the fifteenth day), Duryo-
dhana assured his fleeing army that he
would himself kill Pārthas together with
Pāñcālas and Somakas 7. 134. 54: Duryo-
dhana requested Aśvatthāman to kill
Pāñcālas and Somakas who, agitated, were
moving in his army like a conflagration;
he should kill them before they killed
Kauravas (एते हि सोमका … मम सैन्येषु
संरब्धा विचरन्ति दवाग्निवत्) 7. 134.
76-78; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana
that for his sake and to delight him he
would fight with Pāñcālas, Somakas and
Kekayas (एष गच्छामि संग्रामे त्वत्-
कृते … । … त्वत्प्रियार्थम्); scorched by
his arrows, Somakas and others would
run away in all directions; seeing his
valour, Yudhiṣṭhira and Somakas would
consider the world full of Aśvatthāman
(अश्वत्थाममयं लोकं मंस्यन्ते);
Yudhiṣṭhira would be dejected seeing the
slain Pāñcālas and Somakas; Aśvatthāman
would kill only those who engaged him in
battle (ये मां युद्धे ऽभियोत्स्यन्ति तान्
हनिष्यामि … ); once Somakas were within
his reach they would not return alive 7.
135. 10-14; in the battle that followed
Pāñcālas and Somakas fled 7. 135. 20;
Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas, Matsyas and Somakas
followed Arjuna and Bhīma to attack Droṇa
from right and left respectively (बीभत्सुर्
दक्षिणं पार्श्वम् उत्तरं तु वृकोदरः)
7. 136. 13-14; Duryodhana advised his
brothers to offer protection to Droṇa so
that he would be able to kill Pārthas,
Somakas and Sṛñjayas along with their
kings (सोमकान् हन्यात् सृञ्जयांश् च सरा-
जकान्) 7. 139. 21, 24; in the midst of the
fierce night war (रौद्रे रात्रियुद्धे),
Yudhiṣṭhira exhorted Pāṇḍavas and Soma-
kas to attack Droṇa alone in order to kill
him; accordingly, they attacked Droṇa
uttering frightening cries (अभ्यद्रवत
गच्छध्वं द्रोणम् एव जिघांसया। …
द्रोणम् एवाभ्यवर्तन्त नदन्तो भैर-
वान् रवान्) 7. 140. 2-3; when Karṇa's son
Vṛṣasena cut off the armours of Drupada's
army, Somakas, frightened, fied (सोमका
विप्रदुद्रुवुः); while they were running
away they appeared bright due to the light
of the torches (ततस् तु द्रुपदानीकं
शरैश् छिन्नतनुच्छदम्।संप्राद्रवत्
 … ।द्रवमाणाश् च सोमकाः व्यराजन्त …
प्रदीपैर् अवभासिताः); after defeating
great Somaka charriot-fighters Vṛṣasena
turned towards Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 143. 21, 24-
25, 28; when Śikhaṇḍin, defeated by Kṛpa
turned back, Somakas and others covered
him on all sides; then the battle started
again 7. 144. 25, 27-28; seeing Droṇa kill-
ing the Pāṇḍava army (पाण्डवीं चमूम्),
Somakas quickly pierced him by showering
arrows (विव्यधुः सोमकास् तूर्णं …
शरवृष्टिभिः); but Droṇa deprived them
of their lives 7. 147. 13-14; Kṛṣṇa drew
Arjuna's attention to Bhīma who, cover-
ed by Somakas and the Pāṇḍava army,
attacked Droṇa and Karṇa (वृतः सोमक-
पाण्डवैः) 7. 147. 28; when only the three
parts of the (last quarter of the) night
remained and the sun was about to rise,
Droṇa divided his army into two parts and
attacked Somakas and Pāṇḍavas along with
Pāñcālas (त्रिभागमात्रशेषायाम् रात्र्यां;
अरुणो ऽभ्युदयां चक्रे) 7. 161. 1-3 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 7. 186. 1; त्रिभागमात्रशेषा-
यां मुहूर्तत्रयावशिष्टायाम्); (19) On
the fifteenth day, Droṇa released ब्राह्म
missile trying to kill all Somakas (विनिघ्नन्
सर्वसोमकान्) 7. 164. 80; just before the
fall of Droṇa, Kurus and Somakas got
mixed up with one another in a battle
shouting and felling each other with wea-
pons (ततः प्रवृत्ते संग्रामे विमिश्राः
कुरुसोमकाः। … शस्त्रैर् देहान् अपात-
यन्॥) 7. 165. 99; when the fleeing Pāñcāla
warriors did not return to fight they were
made to stand still where they were by
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna (7. 171. 67-69; 7. 172.
1-2); only Arjuna, along with Somakas
and the constituents of their armies (?)
returned to fight with Aśvatthāman (एक
एव तु बीभत्सुः सोमकावयवैः सह)
7. 172. 3 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 201. 3;
सोमकावयवैः सोमकानाम् अवयवरूपैर्
माण्डलिकैः); (20) On the sixteenth day,
when Aṅgas attacked Nakula, Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Somakas attacked them to
cover Nakula (नकुलं … परि पेतुः …
पाण्डुपाञ्चालसोमकाः); then chariot-
fighters fought with elephant-riders (रथि-
नां हस्तिभिः सह) 8. 17. 21-22; when
Somakas were being killed by the arrows
of Karṇa, afflicted by pain and wounded
by arrows, they hid themselves (अवालीयन्त
राजेन्द्र वेदनार्ताः शरार्दिताः); (the
Kaurava army too, being killed by Nakula,
dispersed in all directions); the two armies
then, standing beyond the range of arrows,
chose to act as spectators (ते सेने …
प्रेक्षकवत् स्थिते) 8. 17. 73-75; (21)
Even after the battle of the sixteenth day,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was confident that Karṇa alone
was capable of killing Pāṇḍavas and Soma-
kas 8. 22. 16; (22) On the seventeenth
day, Arjuna felt that by killing Karṇa he
would give satisfaction to the great chariot-
fighters of Somakas for having fulfilled
their task to help their allies in war (कृतं
कार्यं च मन्यन्तां मित्रकार्येप्सवो
युधि) 8. 52. 25; Karṇa in the afternoon
(अपराह्णे) of that day killed all Somakas
in the presence of Bhīma 8. 56. 7, 53;
Arjuna expressed his fear to Kṛṣṇa that
if Kṛpa, Kṛtavarman and Aśvatthāman
were not killed they would cause the des-
truction of Somakas (अवध्यमानास् ते
ऽस्माभिर् घातयिष्यन्ति सोमकान्) 8. 57. 5;
Karṇa fought a great battle with Somakas
in which he crushed them while destroy-
ing their chariots and killing horses and
elephants (सुमहत् … चक्रे युद्धं सोम-
कान् संप्रमृद्नन्) 8. 60. 14; when Karṇa
came up to Arjuna to kill him, Somakas
urged (अभ्यक्रोशन्) Arjuna to hasten to
pierce Karṇa (with an arrow), cut off his
head without delay and shatter the hope
of Duryodhana to get kingdom (विध्य
कर्णम्।छिन्द्ध्य् अस्य मूर्धानम् अलं
चिरेण श्रद्धां च राज्याद् धृतराष्ट्र-
सूनोः) 8. 65. 10; when Karṇa cover-
ed (समाचिनोत्) Arjuna with a hundred
Kṣudraka arrows and pierced (बिभेद)
Kṛṣṇa with sixty arrows, Somakas fied;
Arjuna stopped them (तदन्तरं सोमकाः
प्राद्रवन्त। … पार्थः सोमकान् प्रत्य-
गृह्णात्) 8. 65. 32-34; seeing Karṇa lying
dead on the ground, Somakas, delighted,
made loud noise, sounded musical instru-
ments and shook their (upper) garments
and hands; others danced and embraced
each other saying: “Karṇa is pierced with
an arrow as fire is extinguished by a strong
wind at the end of a sacrifice or at day-
break in a bedroom; Karṇa's body with
arrows all over it and smeared with blood
shines like sun with his rays; the sun in
the form of Karṇa has been forced to set
by Kāla in the form of Arjuna; as the sun
while setting takes away his light, so has
the arrow taken away Karṇa's life” 8.
67. 28-32; after the death of Karṇa, in the
evening, at the foot of the Himavant
(हैमवते प्रस्थे 9. 5. 1) and near the
river Sarasvatī (9. 4. 49), Śalya when
requested by Duryodhana to lead the army
(9. 5. 26-27), he (Śalya) assured him that
he would defeat Pārthas and Somakas in
battle 9. 6. 3; after Śalya's election as the
general, the great chariot-fighters of Madra-
kas while praising Śalya said that he was
capable of defeating in battle even gods,
demons and men, let alone Somakas and
Sṛñjayas (किमु सोमकसृञ्जयान्) 9. 6. 9;
that night, in the camp of Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa
encouraged Yudhiṣṭhira to fight with Śalya;
after he left, Yudhiṣṭhira gave leave to
Pāñcālas and Somakas to leave his camp
(विसृज्य पाञ्चालान् अथ सोमकान्) 9. 6. 39;
(23) On the eighteenth day when Bhīma
attacked Kṛpa, the great chariot-fighters of
Somakas too attacked him and others in
order to kill their opponents (अभ्य-
द्रवन्त … जिघांसन्तः परान् युधि) 9.
7. 31; Somakas fell down by thousands
due to the arrows of Śalya; after a while,
Śalya again struck down Somakas and
Pāṇḍava army and caused distress to Yudhi-
ṣṭhira (सोमकाश् च सहस्रशः।पतिताः;
शल्यो ऽपि … निघ्नन् सोमकपाण्डवान्। …
युधिष्ठिरम् अपीडयत्) 9. 10. 21, 41;
when Yudhiṣṭhira announced his decision
to kill Śalya, the army of Pāṇḍavas, espe-
cially the Pāñcālas, Somakas and Matsyas,
expressed delight which helped the fulfil-
ment of Yudhiṣṭhira's vow (i. e. encouraged
him) (ततः प्रहर्षः सैन्यानां … पाञ्चा-
लानां सोमकानां मत्स्यानां च विशेषतः।
प्रतिज्ञां तां च सङ्ग्रामे धर्मराजस्य
पूरयन्) 9. 15. 26-27; seeing Śalya, killing
his opponents, angered Somakas and others,
surrounded him (परिवव्रुः) 9. 16. 6;
after the death of Śalya, when the Madra
army attacked the Pāṇḍava army, Somakas
and others covered Yudhiṣṭhira on all
sides to protect him (युधिष्ठिरं परी-
प्सन्तः समन्तात् पर्यवारयन्) 9. 17. 8;
Somakas and others thought that the ele-
phant of king Śālva (9. 19. 2-3), though
one, was moving in thousand forms around
them (तम् एव नागं ददृशुः समन्तात्।
सहस्रशो वै विचरन्तम् एकम्) 9. 19. 6;
Duryodhana alone halted (अवारयत्) with
his sharp missiles the attack of Somakas
and others 9. 20. 34; Aśvatthāman assured
Duryodhana who had taken shelter in the
Dvaipāyana lake that he would kill Soma-
kas and others on that very day (अद्य
निहनिष्यामि सोमकान्) 9. 29. 19; when
Duryodhana's whereabouts became known,
delighted Somakas shouted loudly (प्रा-
क्रोशन् सोमकास् तत्र) 9. 29. 48; Somakas
and others held Duryodhana in high regard
(सर्व एवाभ्यपूजयन्) when he cha-
llenged Bhīma to prove his boasts 9. 55.
40; after the duel began, Somakas and
Pāṇḍavas were afraid when they noticed
the velocity of the wind produced by
Duryodhana's mace (गदा मारुतवेगं हि
दृष्ट्वा) 9. 56. 31; when at one stage
Bhīma lost consciousness due to the stroke
of Duryodhana's mace on his chest, Soma-
kas and Pāṇḍavas, their hopes dashed to
the ground, became dejected (भृशोपहत-
संकल्पा नहृष्टमनसो ऽभवन्) 9. 56.
49; Somakas were thrilled to see Duryo-
dhana fall down (ददृशुः हृष्टरोमाणः)
9. 58. 2; the chief warriors among Somakas,
who were righteous, did not approve of
Bhīma's putting his foot on the head of
fallen Duryodhana (नाभ्यनन्दन् धर्मा-
त्मानः सोमकानां प्रबर्हाः) 9. 58.
13; (24) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman took part
in destroying the camp of Pāṇḍavas and in
killing them and Somakas while fighting,
and then go the way Duryodhana did
(i. e. die in battle) (कच्चित् प्रमथ्य
शिबिरं हत्वा सोमकपाण्डवान्।दुर्यो-
धनस्य पदवीं गतौ परमिकां रणे॥)
10. 8. 3; while moving in the camp, Aśva-
tthāman happened to see the sons of Drau-
padī and the surviving Somakas (अव-
शिष्टांश् च सोमकान्) 10. 8. 44; as far as
the destruction of Somakas, who were
asleep and not on their guard, was con-
cerned that night proved to be extremely
cruel (एवंविधा हि सा रात्रिः सोमकानां
जनक्षये।प्रसुप्तानां प्रमत्तानाम् आसीत्
सुभृशदारुणा॥) 10. 8. 142; Aśvatthāman
was delighted that Somakas and the Mat-
syas who had survived were all killed by
him; he felt that he and his associates
had done their duty; he wanted to give
that very delightful news to Duryodhana
if he was still alive (सोमका मत्स्यशेषाश्
च सर्वे विनिहता मया॥इदानीं कृत-
कृत्याः स्म … ।यदि जीवति नो राजा तस्मै
शंसामहे प्रियम्॥) 10. 8. 150-151.

6-7 (to be identified with Haṃsamārga ?
Cf. Editor's Critical note on the stanza: “If
they are the same people as Haṃsamārga
mentioned in 6. 10. 68, then the B S reading

the four युगस् of the Bhāratavarṣa were
bettered by those who lived in the Haima-
vata Varṣa and more than that by those in
the Harivarṣa (गुणोत्तरं हैमवतं
हरिवर्षं ततः परम्) 6. 11. 14; the lands
around Harivarṣa were known as Uttara-
kurus and no battles ever took place on that

इष्टाम् 2. 23. 9; 2. 24. 1) before the Rājasūya
went from the Hāṭaka Deśa to Harivarṣa;
he wished to conquer also that Varṣa but
was told by the gatekeepers, having large
bodies and great strength, that the city could
not be conquered by him; he should return
since the city could not be entered by
men; if men did enter, they would certainly
die (इदं पुरं यः प्रविशेद् ध्रुवं स
न भवेन् नरः) 2. 25. 10; (Nī., Bom. Ed.
2. 28. 10: न भवेत् म्रियेतेत्य् अर्थः);
moreover, if Arjuna entered it he would
not be able to see anything (नेह द्रक्ष्यसि
किंचन।न हि मानुषदेहेन शक्यम्
अत्राभिवीक्षितुम्) 2. 25. 11-12; Arjuna agreed
to return from Harivarṣa if the country
could not be entered by men; they asked
him if they could do something for him;
Arjuna desired sovereignty for Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and some tribute for him (पार्थिवत्-
वं चिकीर्षामि धर्मराजस्य धीमतः।
 … यत्किंचित् करवन् नः प्रदीयताम्);
after receiving from the gatekeepers tribute
in the form of heavenly garments, heavenly
ornaments and heavenly stripped-off hairy
skins of antelopes Arjuna turned back
(ततो दिव्यानि वस्त्रानि दिव्यान्य् आभरणानि
च।मोकाजिनानि दिव्यानि तस्मै ते प्रददुः
करम्॥) 2. 25. 13-16 (Nī., Bom. Ed.
2. 28. 16 reads क्षौमाजिनानि in place of
मोकाजिनानि and explains क्षुमातसीविशेषः
 … तत्तन्तुनिर्मितानि क्षौमाणि अजिनानि च।);
(2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya to describe
to him the Harivarṣa in details (how long
the people there lived, the fruits they
received for their actions, auspicious or
otherwise, their past, present and future
(प्रमाणम् आयुषः सूत फलं चापि शुभा-
शुभम्।अनागतम् अतिक्रान्तं वर्तमानं
च संजय) 6. 11. 1-2; Saṃjaya then
told to him the qualities of the people of
the Bhāratavarṣa in the four Yugas and
further told him that the qualities were
found in a higher degree in the Harivarṣa

B. Past events: (1)
A certain prince, not named, of Haihayas
thought that he had killed a sage mistaking
him to be a deer; he reported the incident
to Haihayas; dejected, Haihayas (दीन-
मानसाः 3. 182. 7) went in search of the
dead sage; they reached the hermitage of
Tārkṣya Ariṣṭanemi; they were duly receiv-
ed by him (तेषां पूजाम् अथाहरत् 3. 182.
9); Haihayas, however, considered that
they were unworthy of the honour since
they had killed a Brāhmaṇa; they told
Ariṣṭanemi that they had searched for him
but could not find him; then they were
told by Ariṣṭanemi that they had commi-
tted no sin since whom they thought they
had killed was his son who was alive, and
was present in his आश्रम; Haihayas asked
Tārkṣya how his dead son came back to
life; they were told that since Ariṣṭanemi
and his son always acted truthfully and
never cherished a lie, and since they follow-
ed religion they had no fear from death
(सत्यम् एवाभिजानीमो नानृते कुर्महे
मनः।स्वधर्मम् अनुतिष्ठामस् तस्मान्
मृत्युभयं न नः 3. 182. 17); when
Haihayas knew that they were sinless, they
were delighted (हृष्टाः) and they returned
to their country 3. 182. 21; (2) Rāma
Jāmadagnya killed thousands of Haihayas
(हैहयसहस्राणि) along with Kārtavīrya
Arjuna's sons and grandsons and made
the earth full of their blood-stained mud
(चकार भार्गव्ō राजन् महीं शोणित-
कर्दमाम्) 12. 49. 45-46; after many years,
the Earth when not properly protected by
Kṣatriyas entered Rasātala and requested
Kaśyapa to see that some eminent Kṣa-
triyas protected her again; she specifically
mentioned for this purpose the Kṣatriyas
born in the family of Haihayas who were
protected by her when Paraśurāma killed all
Kṣatriyas (सन्ति … नृषु क्षत्रियपुंगवाः।
हैहयानां कुले जातास् ते संरक्षन्तु मां
मुने) 12. 49. 66; a reference to the killing
of Haihayas and of Kārtavīrya is made in
the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan while listing the
events of the Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 117
(actually the event referred to here is des-
cribed in the Śāntiparvan as noted above;
the event briefly mentioned in the Āra-
ṇyakaparvan is different; see the next); (3)
King Sagara of Ikṣvāku family extirpated
Haihayas and Tālajaṅghas (स हैहयान्-
समुत्साद्य … ) 3. 104. 7; (4) Kṣatriya
Haihayas were attacked by Brāhmaṇas,
Vaiśyas and Śūdras; they were again and
again defeated by the Haihayas; the Brāh-
maṇas asked them the secret of their victory;
Haihayas replied saying that on the battle-
field they listened only to one among them
who had superior judgement; the Brāh-
maṇas and the rest who attacked them were
divided, each following his own judgement;
the Brāhmaṇas then chose one of them
who was skilled in policies and defeated
the Kṣatriya (Haihayas) (वयम् एकस्य
शृणुमो महाबुद्धिमतो रणे।भवन्तस्
तु पृथक् सर्वे स्वबुद्धिवशवर्तिनः॥)
5. 153. 4-9; (5) Udāvarta, king of
Haihayas, mentioned among the eighteen
kings who, at the end of the युग (युगा-
न्ते), extirpated their kinsmen, friends and
relatives (ये समुच्चिच्छिदुर् ज्ञतीन् सुहृदश्
च सबान्धवान् … हैहयानाम् उदावर्तो …
युगान्ते … संभूताः) 5. 72. 11, 13, 17;
these kings are described as disgraceful to
their race and mean (कुलपांसनाः;
कुलेषु पुरुषाधमाः).

referred to as one belonging to the Hai-
haya people, one born in that line; or the
kings of Haihayas; or foremost among the

fame (महायशस्) 12. 263. 27; magnanim-
ous (महात्मन्) 12. 263. 7.
B. Kuṇḍa-
dhāra figures in an ancient narrative
(इतिहासं पुरातनम्) told by Bhīṣma to
Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his question:
What is most profitable among the three
Puruṣārthas viz. धर्म, अर्थ and काम
(2. 263. 1-2); in the narrative, Kuṇḍadhāra
obliges a Brāhmaṇa due to affection for
his devotee (कुण्डधारेण यत् प्रीत्या
भक्तायोपकृतं पुरा) 12. 263. 2-55;
the narrative runs as follows: A certain
poor Brāhmaṇa desired to obtain wealth
in order to perform a sacrifice; he therefore
worshipped many deities but did not get
wealth; he then wondered which could be
that one deity which would show him favour
quickly; he then saw standing near him
the cloud Kuṇḍadhāra (जलधरं कुण्ड-
धारं st. 6) who appeared before him
assuming an agreeable form (सौम्येन
वपुषा st. 6); the Brāhmaṇa felt assured
by Kuṇḍadhāra's form and felt that he
would definitely give him ample wealth;
the Brāhmaṇa became his devotee and
worshipped Kuṇḍadhāra with incenses,
perfumes, garlands and oblations (ततो
धूपैश् च गन्धैश् च माल्यैर् उच्चावचैर्
अपि।बलिभिश् चापि … , st. 9); the cloud,
satisfied, told the Brāhmaṇa that there were
expiations for the sins committed due to
killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, theft,
breaking a vow, but there was no expiation
for the sin of ungratefulness (कृतघ्ने
नास्ति निष्कृतिः st. 11); अधर्म was the
child of craving, anger of envy, greed of
insult (निकृत्याः), and that an ungrateful
person did not deserve progeny (कृतघ्नो
नार्हति प्रजाम् st. 12); then the Brāhmaṇa,
lying on the कुश grass, due to the lustre
(तेजस्) of Kuṇḍadhāra, saw in a dream
(निदर्शनम् अपश्यत st. 14), Maṇibhadra
distributing kingdoms and wealth as desir-
ed by gods (मणिभद्रं व्यादिशन्तम् … ।
तत्र देवाः प्रयच्छन्ति राज्यानि च
धनानि च st. 15-16); Kuṇḍadhāra fell
at the feet of Maṇibhadra; Maṇibhadra, at
the instance of gods, asked Kuṇḍadhāra
what he desired; Kuṇḍadhāra replied that if
the gods were satisfied with him they should
show that kind of favour to the Brāhmaṇa
which would lead him to happiness (अस्या-
नुग्रहम् इच्छामि कृतं किंचित् सुखो-
दयम् st. 19); again, at the instance of
the gods, Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra
that he was willing to give the Brāhmaṇa
as much wealth as desired by him; Kuṇḍa-
dhāra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth)
was fickle, decided to fix the Brāhmaṇa's
mind on practising austerities (विचार्य
कुण्डधारस् तु मानुषं चलम् अध्रुवम्।
तपसे मतिम् आधत्त ब्राह्मणस्य यशस्-
विनः) 12. 263. 22; Kuṇḍadhāra therefore
told Maṇibhadra that he would not seek
wealth for the Brāhmaṇa, but that the
Brāhmaṇa be devoted to धर्म; he desir-
ed that the Brāhmaṇa should take delight
in धर्म and should live following the
धर्म (भवेद् एष तु धार्मिकः।धर्मे
ऽस्य रमतां बुद्धिर् धर्मं चैवोप-
जीवतु।) 12. 263. 25; when Maṇibhadra
persisted on giving the Brāhmaṇa kingdom
and various kinds of happiness since that
was what one aspired to get by follow-
ing धर्म, Kuṇḍadhāra did not change
his mind and wanted his Brāhmaṇa devotee
to live following the धर्म; the gods
were pleased with him; Maṇibhadra told
Kuṇḍadhāra that the gods were satisfied
with him and that the Brāhmaṇa's mind
would be fixed on धर्म and that he would
be a धर्मात्मा; Kuṇḍadhāra was delight-
ed for having obtained what was desired in
the form of a boon not easily obtained by
others; the Brāhmaṇa saw thin garments
around him but his mind was not deluded;
abandoning them, he went to the forest
and practised severe austerities; he felt that
if he so desired he could certainly give
some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39);
at that juncture Kuṇḍadhāra again appeared
before the Brāhmaṇa due to his friendship
with him and the severe austerities per-
formed by him; the Brāhmaṇa, surprised,
received him according to the rites; Kuṇḍa-
dhāra told the Brāhmaṇa that he had now
obtained the highest divine insight (दिव्यं
ते चक्षुर् उत्तमम् 12. 263. 42) and by
using it the Brāhmaṇa should see the ulti-
mate fate of the kings and the worlds
they would get; then the Brāhmaṇa by his
divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in
the hell; Kuṇḍadhāra wondered that if the
Brāhmaṇa, after worshipping him was to
get unhappiness, what kind of favour had
he done to him ? He therefore asked the
Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to
realize that it was futile to run after various
longings because the door to heaven was
closed for such men (कामान् इच्छेद् कथं
नरः।स्वर्गद्वारं हि संरुद्धं मानु-
षेषु विशेषतः॥ 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa
then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear,
arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder
men from going to heaven (ततो ऽपश्यत् स
कामं च क्रोधं लोभं भयं मदम्।
निद्रां तन्द्रीं तथालस्यम् आवृत्य पुरुषान्
स्थितान्॥ 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again
told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned
before, stopped men from going to heaven;
gods were afraid of such men; (these vices),
as ordained by the gods, create obstacles
all around (तथैव देववचनाद् विघ्नं
कुर्वन्ति सर्वशः॥ 12. 263. 47); no one
who was not permitted by gods could be
virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his auste-
rities, could confer kingdoms and wealth
on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet
of the cloud (तोयधारिणे i. e. Kuṇḍa-
dhāra) and told him that he had done a
great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍa-
dhāra to forgive him for having formerly
envied him (पुरा ते यद् असूयितम्) due
to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra
embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that
he had forgiven him and then disappeared;
the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the
skies due to his austerities to which he was
led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness
he also gained what he wanted and the
highest bliss (विहायसा च गमनं तथा
संकल्पितार्थता।धर्माच् छक्त्या तथा
योगाद् या चैव परमा गतिः॥) 12. 263.

जिवनी
Jivanī: See Saṃjīvanī.

ज्येष्ठसामन्
Jyeṣṭhasāman nt.: Name of a Sāman.
A. Referred to in some past events:
(1) Upamanyu told Śakra that when he saw
Śiva Mahādeva, he was being praised by all
gods (13. 14. 146); Nārāyaṇa at that time
praised Mahādeva by singing the स्तोत्र
using Jyeṣṭhasāman (ज्येष्ठसाम्ना च
देवेशं जगौ नारायणस् तदा) 13. 14. 147
[Editor's note, with a question mark, on the
stanza, Vol. 17, p. 1060 Jyeṣṭhasāman =
Bārhatasāman ?]; (2) In the Kṛtayuga the
Sātvata Dharma was received by Brahman
from Nārāyaṇa himself and was taught to
the Barhiṣad sages; from them it went to a
Brāhmaṇa called Jyeṣṭha who was versed in
the Sāmaveda (सामवेदान्तगं द्विजम्);
in this context it is said that god Hari
observes the व्रत of Jyeṣṭhasāman (ज्येष्ठ-
सामव्रतो हरिः) (i. e. Hari always uses
Jyeṣṭhasāman while singing praises) 12. 336.
42.
B. Its holiness: One who can sing
a स्तोत्र using Jyeṣṭhasāman melody is
included among those Brāhmaṇas who are
considered to be पङ्क्तिपावन or पाङ्क्तेय
(i. e. highly respectable, one who purifies
those who sit in a line with him while tak-
ing meals (पाङ्क्तेयांस् तु वक्ष्यामि ज्ञेयास्
ते पङ्क्तिपावनाः। … छन्दोगो ज्येष्ठ-
सामगः) 13. 90. 19-20.

31; a doer of evil deeds, who is covetous,
to whom untruth is dear, who is always
engaged in deception, he, due to these
cheatings (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 321. 31:
उपनिधिभिश् छलेन), goes to this hell
and experiences great unhappiness; he
plunges into the great river Vaitaraṇī
whose waters are hot and then gets his
limbs cut by the leaves of trees which are
sharp like a sword; ultimately he falls in-
to the Paraśuvana hell; he lives there
experiencing great affliction (यो लुब्धः
सुभृशं प्रियानृतश् च मनुष्यः सतत-
निकृतिवञ्चनारतिः स्यात्।उपनिधिभिर्
असुखकृत् स परमनिरयगो भृशम्

315. 31 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 328. 31:
संवान्ति संगच्छन्ति); it takes away the
lives of living beings at the time of their
death; both Mṛtyu (Death) and Vaiva-
svata (Yama) follow its path; it leads those
to immortality who, with their intellect
calm and steady in आत्मन्, understand (the
world) correctly and who take delight in
the practice of meditation; having met Parā-
vaha ten thousand sons of Dakṣa Prajāpati
reached quickly the end of directions; one
who is created (touched ?) by it, is de-
feated; he goes away never to return (?)
(सर्वप्राणभृतां प्राणान् यो ऽन्तकाले

they blow along the seven paths of
winds which blow together on the earth
and in the atmosphere (पृथिव्याम् अन्त-
रिक्षे च यत्र संवान्ति वायवः।सप्तैते
वायुमार्गा वै) 12. 315. 31; (b) Special
to Parivaha: Due to its circular movement
the heavenly waters flow in the atmosphere
(and do not fall down); it supports the
holy waters of celestial Gaṅgā; being
checked by this wind from a distance the
sun, though he is the source of a thousand
rays and brightens up the earth, appears
like having a single ray; due to this wind
the moon, which is the heavenly store of
nectar, waxes (after waning) (यस्मिन्
पारिप्लवे दिव्या वहन्त्य् आपो विहायसा।
पुण्यं चाकाशगङ्गायास् तोयं विष्टभ्य
तिष्ठति॥दूरात् प्रतिहतो यस्मिन्न् एकरश्मिर्

छचीपतिः) 5. 128. 48; Dhṛtarāṣṭra while
describing the best exploits of Kṛṣṇa men-
tions that he had frightened Amarāvatī and
removed the Pārijāta from the abode of
Indra ( … त्रासयित्वामरावतीम्।म्छेन्द्र-
भवनाद् वीरः पारिजातम् उपानयत्) 7. 10.
22. (Its use in pl. in 3. 220. 23 (पारिजात-

Kubera and drove him out of Laṅkā, he
deprived Kubera of his Puṣpaka Vimāna;
Vaiśravaṇa, however, cursed Rāvaṇa that
the Vimāna would never carry him; it would
carry only him who would kill Rāvaṇa in a
battle (न त्वाम् एतद् वहिष्यति।यस् तु त्वां
समरे हन्ता तम् एवैतद् वहिष्यति) 3. 259.
