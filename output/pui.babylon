Śiva found fault with her and after reproaching him with his past deeds, she left him for penance. Vīraka appealed to her when she said she would return as Gaurī. She asked Vīraka to see that no lady entered her harem. Meanwhile Āḍi, son of Andhakāsura entered Śiva's abode in the guise of Umā but was slain by Śiva. Hearing from Vāyu that a lady entered her home, she cursed Vīraka to be born on the earth; out of her rage came out a lion which Brahmā gave to the Goddess of Night, who was asked to leave Umā for the Vindhya hills.

Subsequently Nārada confirmed what he heard from the welkin. So he killed all her sons and put her and Vasudeva in jail. He waited for the seventh and was particularly afraid of the eighth. Being informed of the birth of a girl, and without listening to his sister's appeal to spare the baby, he dashed it against a stone. It flew heavenwards and said that the baby born to vanquish him  was safe. Disheartened, Kaṃsa let Vasudeva and Devakī free.

He summoned his councillors and asked the Mallas, Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika to get ready for a wrestling match with Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; ordered his mahout to station the State Elephant at the gate of the enclosure (Raṅga) and get Kṛṣṇa and Rāma trampled under its feet; when he was asked why he was out to kill those two boys, he narrated the story of his mother once going in the garden thinking of her husband Ugrasena. Then a Gandharva Drumila personated Ugrasena. Discovering that he was not her husband, she asked him in wrath who he was. He tried to console her saying that she would give birth to a heroic son. The chaste lady retorted that he would be cruel and unrighteous. Such being his birth, he hated his kith and kin. Then he commanded to commence the Dhanuryāga. Akrūra was sent for and ordered to take his chariot and bring Kṛṣṇa and Rāma to the Dhanuryāga with all gopas. He proposed to kill all of them and rule the kingdoms with the help of friends like Jarāsandha. Thanked by Akrūra for an opportunity to visit Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; Akrūra reached the Vraja and was welcomed by the brothers and Nanda. Informed of their arrival by Akrūra. Much concerned to know of the breaking of his bow by Kṛṣṇa and further the killing of his guards. He had no sleep all night and had bad dreams, all in fear of Kṛṣṇa. Next morning he drove  to the wrestling ground and occupied the royal seat with his ministers; was perturbed to learn of the death of Kuvalayāpīḍa and its guards. Became furious at the death of his five mallas and the running away of others. Ordered the banishment of the two brothers, robbing the gopas of their belongings, and imprisonment of Nanda, killing of Ugrasena and Vasudeva. Kṛṣṇa attacked him direct, pulled him down from his throne and killed him. His eight brothers who offered fight were slain by Rāma. 5) Ib. X. chap. 36-44; M. 47. 4, 6; 69. 8; Vi.

Once while out in the woods tending Śukra's cows, the Asuras killed him and left his body to be devoured by dogs and jackals. The cows returned home but not Kaca. Devayānī suspected of foul play and reported his death. Śukra brought him back to life. 1) M. 25. 14-37. On another occasion he went to the woods to gather flowers for Devayānī and this time the Asuras ground him to pieces and mixing them with surā offered it to Śukra who drank it. Again Devayānī persisted wanting him back to life. This meant Śukra's death for he had to come out by tearing open his belly. So he taught Kaca the Samjīvinī vidyā so that he might restore him after his revival. Thus he did and so he learnt the vidyā. After a sojourn of ten hundred years he returned with due leave from his teacher. Now Devayānī offered to marry him but he pointed out that it was not proper to marry his preceptor's daughter. So  she cursed that he would not get the fruits of his vidyā and he retorted that she would not find a Brāhmaṇa husband but only a Kṣatriya.

When once Yaśodā left the churning pot to mind the boiling milk overflowing in the oven, Kṛṣṇa broke the curd pot and ran away with butter to feed a monkey. So he was bound with a rope to an ulūkhala (mortar) but the rope always fell two inches  short in spite of bits being added. At last Kṛṣṇa pitied her and allowed himself to be tied; with the mortar he passed between two tall Arjuna trees, when down fell the trees, out of which emerged two men Nalakubera and Maṇigrīva (sons of Kubera) who had been cursed by Nārada.

Once when in the forest with his playmates, Agha, an asura friend of Kaṃsā took the form of a boa-constrictor with a view to devour the cattle and all boys together.

Slowly Kṛṣṇa brought the reptile under his control, and getting on its hood, began to dance, when the Kālīya acknowledged defeat. Finding his end near, Kālīya's wives prayed to Kṛṣṇa to spare him. The generous Lord allowed him to make his abode in the sea, thus purifying the Yamunā once for all. 13) Bhā. X. Chaps. 15 and 16. Vi. V. 7 (whole).

It was a severe day in summer when some Gopas approached him for food. Kṛṣṇa advised them to go to the neighbouring yajñaśāla and ask for food, singing the praises of Balarāma and himself. The sacrificers were silent at their request. Kṛṣṇa asked them to repeat their request to ladies in his name. The ladies took four kinds of food and in spite of protest by their male relations, they came to have darsan of the Lord and placed before Him all the eatables. On Kṛṣṇa's advice they went back to complete the sacrifice, and assured them of their being accepted by their relations and the world.

Kṛṣṇa advised them to go back to Vraja and be loyal to their husbands. They refused to return as their minds were fixed upon him and longed for mokṣa, and insisted they were his dāsis and should be accepted. After some time he disappeared for their peace and redemption. They indulged in gītam, when the Lord appeared in their midst and shone like Puruṣa among śaktis. After consoling them he engaged them in a rāsakrīḍa, and finding them wearied, he engaged them in watersports and sports in the upavana on the river-bank. There was no carnal act of sin. The Lord who had no bandha, did all this in sport. 18) Bhā. X. Chaps. 27-33; Vi. IV. 12. 12. Released Nanda from a reptile who turned out to be vidyādhara Sudarśana.

Then they met a garland-maker Sudāma who voluntarily offered flowergarlands. Him he blessed and went. Next he saw a hunchback woman carrying unguents to Kaṃsā. For the mere asking she offered the whole of it to them. So Kṛṣṇa converted her to a handsome lady who invited him to her house. This was agreed after finishing his work. Then they went through the bazaar and were rewarded with betels, sandal, etc., by merchants. Lastly they entered the place where the bow festival was held. Kṛṣṇa broke it easily. The guards who attacked them were put to death. It was evening when they returned to the camp outside the city. 20) Bhā. X. Chaps. 37. 42; Vi. V. 16. 7-16, 23; Chaps. 18, 19.

Finding all his army followers killed, Jarāsandha attacked Rāma. When the latter was about to bind him with ropes, Kṛṣṇa asked that he be set free. Jarāsandha went home greatly distressed. Three months after, Jarāsandha collected  another huge army of twenty-three akṣauhinis, encamped at Yamunā banks and slept that night. Kṛṣṇa divided his army into three divisions and attacked the enemy on all sides by surprise. All Jarāsandha's followers took to flight leaving all their belongings which were presented to Ugrasena.

I. 7. 19-27; Br. I. 1. 56-64; Ib. II. 37. 38-50;. To the Satra of Viśvasṛk Dakṣa came and was welcomed by all standing, except Brahmā and Śiva. On this Dakṣa burst into anger against Śiva and insulted him saying he had eyes like a monkey, was a breaker of law and convention, lord of the Bhūtas and Gaṇas; he then cursed that Śiva should have no more share in sacrifices and went away. Nandi got enraged at this and imprecated a curse on Dakṣa that he would lose all knowledge of Ātman, and assuming the face of a sheep, would become dull-witted. Bhṛgu then pronounced a counter-curse that those propitiating Śiva shall become Pākhaṇḍas. 3) Bhā. IV. 2 (whole). M. 13. 11-55, 60; 183. 22-3. Appointed by Brahmā as the overlord of all Prajāpatis, Dakṣa began the sacrifice of Bṛhaspatisava to which all gods went in groups. Satī also expressed her desire to go and requested permission of Śiva, who reminded her of the insult offered to him. 4) Ib. IV. 3. (whole). As she was persistent, she was allowed to attend. Going, she found that she was not properly welcomed by her father. The enraged Satī sat facing the northern direction in yoga and cast off her body by means of the fire of Samādhī to the distress of gods and others. On this the Gaṇa followers of Satī attacked Dakṣa, when Bhṛgu created a class of gods, Ṛbhus who vanquished these Gaṇas. 5) Ib. IV. 4 (whole). Having heard of all this from Nārada, Śiva grew angry; out of his anger sprang Vīrabhadra who was ordered to ruin Dakṣa's sacrifice. The beard of Bhṛgu was cut off, and Dakṣa's head was severed from his body and thrown into the Dakṣiṇāgni. 6) Ib. IV. 5 (whole). Vā. 30 (whole). The Gods waited upon Brahmā who proceeded to Kailāsa. He conciliated Śiva and pleaded for the revival of Dakṣa and continuation of his Yajña promising a share to him. 7) Bhā. IV. 6 (whole). Śiva agreed but  said that Dakṣa should have the face of the sheep, Bhaga, Mitra's eye, and Bhṛgu the beard of a sheep. Agreeing to this Brahmā went with Śiva to the sacrificial hall of Dakṣa. Now Dakṣa began to praise Śiva. When Viṣṇu's offering was poured to secure the continuation of the sacrifice, Viṣṇu presented himself in person when Dakṣa, Ṛtviks, Sadasyas, Rudra and others present, spoke in his praise. Pleased at this, Hari remarked there was no difference among the Trimurtīs. Dakṣa brought the yajña to a successful end. 8) Ib. IV. 7 (whole); 29. 42. Another account.

The devotee bathing in any tīrtha on the Narmadā gets the benefit of performing an Aśvamedha sacrifice. 3) M. ch. 186. The Lord enshrined here is Maheśvara who devised plans to vanquish Bāṇāsura of Tripura with the help of Nārada. The Lord was much concerned about virtuous ladies in Tripura and Nārada undertook to delude them by proclaiming ordinances to ladies to give gifts to poor and deserving Brahmanas. 4) Ib. ch. 187. Śiva got ready for war here and attacked Tripura with incendiary materials. Out of the three cities comprising Tripura, (s.v.) two fell down reduced to ashes. The first city became converted into the Śri Śaila hill, and the second Amarakaṇṭaka hill, both adorned by the Siddhas, Gandharvas and so on. The Lord enshrined at the latter is Jvāleśvara. The third city was left unconsumed. 5) Ib. ch. 188.  It is said that at the confluence of the Narmadā with Kāverī, Kubera practised tapas in honour of Śiva and became the Lord of the Yakṣas.

To the north of the Narmadā are a number of tīrthams like Mantreśvara, Garjanā, Amrātaka, Karanyā, Kuṇḍeśvara and others. A bath in each of them rids one of all sins. Then follows other tīrthas, all equally sacred, including Rāvaṇeśvara, the shrines of Kubera, Ahalyātīrtha, and the shrine of Janārdana. Here Agni, Dharmarāja and Vāyu practised asceticism and attained emancipation. A visit to Śuklatīrtham sacred to Rājaṛṣi Cāṇakya washes off all the sins of a life time. Any gift given here bears rich fruits. 7) Ib. chh. 190-192. Among the other sacred places can be mentioned the Bhṛgutīrtham, Kankhala, where Garuḍa once was in austereties, Kanyātīrtha, Pitāmahatīrtha, and Svargadvāratīrtham; He who reads or listens to the glory of the Namadā has his wishes fulfilled whatever be his caste. 8) Ib. chh. 193-194.

Sins are washed off by entering its boundary. The goddess Yamunā, the daughter of the Sun God is ever present: It is a place haunted by the Gods, Asuras, Ṛṣis and Siddhas; 1) M. ch. 104. one who remembers Prayāgā from his own native home or from a foreign place on the eve of his death goes to the world of Brahmā. Leaving the heaven, he is reborn as a King of Jambūdvīpa; gifts of cows, jewels and gold here attain great merit: The giver is born in Uttara Kuru regions and enjoys long life. 2) Ib. ch. 105. One should not drive to the place in a conveyance drawn by bullocks lest the virtue of bathing should be lost. Giving daughters in marriage, and death near the Akṣayavaṭa helps one in going to the world of Śiva. One should go and do charities with utmost faith. Here are 60 crores and 10000 holy spots; wellknown for a Śiva shrine: Pratiṣṭhāna lies to the east of the Ganges, and to its north lies the Hamsaprapatana Tīrtha. There are again Ūrvaśīramaṇa, Sandhya Vaṭa, Koṭī Tīrtha, and others, all holy; 3) Ib. ch. 106. by merely listening to the greatness of Prayāgā a man gets liberated. To the south of Prayāgā there is a Ṛṇamocana Tīrtha where by residing for a night and by bathing, one never runs into debts. A pilgrimage to P. gives the benefit of an Aśvamedha sacrifice: relieves his manes for ten generations: its circumference is five yojanas  and every step is sacred: the greatness of the Yamunā described; 4) Ib. chh. 107-8. a man dying at P. gets the benefits of a Yogin: the king of all tīrthas: P. is again the place where both Kambala and Aśvatara reside. It is the altar of Prajāpati. It is more sacred, being situated on the banks of the Ganges. It is the giver of heaven, the personification of bliss and truth: Reading the Mahātmya takes one to heaven; 5) Ib. chh. 109-110. Here Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva are all present. Brahmā stands on the Northern part of the Tīrtha to protect it: Viṣṇu is represented as Veṇī Mādhava, while Śiva is present in the shape of a banyan tree. In addition to them, the gods, oceans and mountains also live there. It is known as Prajāpati Indrakṣetra. One who remembers this every day attains heaven. After hearing this, Yudhiṣṭhira is said to have bathed in Prayāgā. 6) Ib. chh. 111-112; 180. 56; 192. 11; 193. 19.

Prahlāda was defiant in the sabhā of Hiraṇyakaśipu; found in Narasimha the Lord Vāsudeva and spoke to those in the sabhā, but in vain; taking up his sword Hiraṇyakaśipu asked him to show Hari at the post near by which he knocked with his fist; out came Narasimha and destroyed Hiraṇyakaśipu in the midst of portents; universal rejoicing and praise of Hari; the Gods found Narasimha still raging in anger and requested Prahlāda to praise Him; his praise; pleased, the Lord prompted him to ask for boons; Prahlāda said that desires were the seeds of samsāra and therefore he did not want them; he only wanted to be ever devoted to him; Narasimha asked him to be king and at the same time be devoted to him; and when the time came for him he could cast off his body and get himself merged into Hari; then Prahlāda requested for the pardon and purification of his father which were granted; after the funeral ceremonies of his father, Prahlāda  became king; then he worshipped Brahmā, Śiva and other Gods who all blessed him; obliged to Viṣṇu; 7) Ib.

Here Bhagavān Piṅgala became Gaṇeśvara and Kṣetrapāla and distributor of food to the residents in the city. He was originally a Yakṣa, son of Pūrṇabhadra. He devoted himself to severe austerities and was blessed by Śiva to be a Gaṇapati. 1) M. ch. 180. It is Avimukta tīrtha for here Śiva is omnipresent and is never absent from there. All sinners who die here become Rudras in time. Śiva stands here like a pillar, motionless till the deluge. Every part of the city is holy. 2) Ib. ch. 181. He who remains here for a month gets the benefit of observing the Pāśupata vow. By living permanently one gets true emancipation.

It is the seat of Brahmā. But it deludes nondevotees. Here Vedavyāsa resided for 12 years observing the vow of silence. At the end of the vow he felt hungry and asked for alms. None was able to feed him. When he was about to curse the city, Śiva and Pārvatī took the human form and entertained him to his satisfaction. Then Vyāsa knew of his guests who remarked that a man of choleric temper like himself should not live in that city. But he was permitted to visit it twice a fortnight on Aṣṭami and Caturdaśī days. 6) Ib. ch. 185.
