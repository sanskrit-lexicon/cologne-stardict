1. Akṣa, ‘axle,’ is a part of a chariot often referred to in 
the Rigveda
	1 and later. It was apparently
	2 fastened to the 
body of the chariot (Kośa) by straps (akṣā-nah, lit. ‘tied to the 
axle,’ though this word is also
	3 rendered ‘horse’). The 
heating of the axle and the danger of its breaking were known.
	4 
The part of the axle round which the nave of the wheel 
revolved was called Āṇi, ‘pin.’ 1) i. 30, 14; 166, 9; iii. 53, 17; vi.

2. Akṣa. — This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda 
onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and 
‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main 
amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent 
mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable 
difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it 
was played. 
(1) The Material. — The dice appear normally to have been 
made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the 
Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda,
	2 hence being called ‘brown’ 
(babhru), and ‘born on a windy spot.’
	3 In the ritual game of 
dice at the Agnyādheya and the Rājasūya ceremonies the 
material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that 
occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used.
	4 
There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use 
of cowries as dice.
	5 
(2) The Number. — In the Rigveda
	6 the dicer is described as 
‘leader of a great horde’ (senānīr mahato gaṇasya), and in 
another passage
	7 the number is given as tri-pañcāśaḥ, an expres
sion which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig,
	8 Weber,
	9 
and Zimmer
	10 render it as fifteen, which is grammatically 
hardly possible. Roth
	11 and Grassmann
	12 render it as ‘con
sisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders
	13 takes it as ‘consisting of one 
hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a 
vague expression for a large number. For a small number 
Zimmer
	14 cites a reference in the Rigveda
	15 to one who fears 
‘him who holds four’ (caturaś cid dadamānāt), but the sense of 
that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of 
playing the game. 
(3) The Method of Play. — In several passages of the later 
Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions con
nected with dicing. The names are Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara, 
Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
	16 In the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	17 among the victims at the Puruṣamedha, 
the kitava is offered to the Akṣarāja, the ādinava-darśa to the 
Kṛta, the kalpin to the Tretā, the adhi-kalpin to the Dvāpara, 
the sabhā-sthāṇu to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel 
version of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa are kitava, sabhāvin, ādinava- 
darśa, bahiḥ-sad, and sabhā-sthāṇu,
	18 and Aksarāja, Kṛta, Tretā, 
Dvāpara, and Kali. From the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	19 it appears 
that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists 
in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū 
and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa list. The names of some of these throws 
go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs 
in the latter,
	20 and Lüders
	21 shows that in a considerable number 
of passages in the former Kṛta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’
	22 
or ‘what is won’
	23 and this sense is clearly found in the 
Atharvaveda.
	24 Moreover, that there were more throws (ayāḥ) 
than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda,
	25 when 
the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying 
wealth. 
The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg 
Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied 
either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so 
marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late 
commentators.
	26 But there is no evidence for the former 
interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the 
Vibhīdaka nuts,
	27 used as dice, forbids any side being properly 
on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip 
tion of a ritual game
	28 at the Agnyādheya and at the Rājasūya 
ceremonies. The details are not certain,
	29 but it is clear that 
the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a 
number divisible by four, the Kṛta, the other three throws then 
being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by 
four; the Dvāpara, when two was the remainder; and the Kali, 
when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the 
throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kṛta was that 
when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals 
marked on them, the only question being what was the total 
number of the dice themselves. 
There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the 
Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details 
must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly 
large,
	30 and the reference to throwing fours,
	31 and losing by one, 
points to the use of the Kṛta as the winning throw. The 
Atharvaveda,
	32 on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as 
the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must 
have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players 
merely pick out the number of dice required — no doubt to avoid 
ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had 
been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown,
	33 
perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders:
	34 the one 
throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other 
then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown 
a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for 
the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player, 
as in the Nala. 
No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which 
the dice were thrown (adhi-devana, devana,
	35 iriṇa
	36 ), was made 
in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to 
a case for keeping dice in (akṣa-vapana
	37 The throw was called 
graha
	38 or earlier grābha.
	39 The stake is called vij.
	40 Serious 
losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments 
the loss of all his property, including his wife.
	41 Lüders
	42 finds 
a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad.

kaṇṭha on Harivaṃśa, ii. 61, 39, the 
stake was divided into ten parts, and 
the Kali then took one, the Dvāpara 
three, the Tretā six, and the Kṛta all 
ten. This explanation seems harsh.

अक्ष
3. Akṣa. — In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 3, 1) this word 
seems to denote the nut of the Vibhīdaka (Terminalia bellerica).

अक्षत
अक्षत
 or Akṣita. — In one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	1 
dealing with the Jāyānya, mention is made of a remedy for 
sores designated both Akṣita and Sukṣata, or, according to 
the reading of the Kauṣika Sūtra, Akṣata and Sukṣata, while 
Sāyaṇa has Akṣita and Sukṣita. Bloomfield
	2 renders ‘not 
caused by cutting’ and ‘caused by cutting.’ Formerly
	3 he 
suggested ‘tumour’ or ‘boil.’ Whitney
	4 thinks that two 
varieties of Jāyānya are meant. Ludwig
	5 reads with Sāyana 
akṣita, which he renders by ‘not firmly established’ in the 
invalid. Zimmer
	6 finds in it a disease Kṣata. 1) vii. 76, 4. 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 17, 562. 3) Journal of the American Oriental

अक्षावपन

 See Akṣa.

अक्षु
अक्षु
 — The word occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda
	1 
and one of the Rigveda.
	2 Roth
	3 renders it by ‘net,’ while 
Böhtlingk
	4 suggests ‘axle of a car.’ Geldner
	5 sees in it a stake 
or pole used with a fishermen's net (Jāla),
	6 the pole of a wagon,
	7 
and the pole of a house, whether vertical or horizontal, he leaves 
uncertain (see Vaṃśa).
	8 Bloomfield
	9 takes it as a covering 
of wickerwork stretched across a beam and sloping down to 
both sides — like a thatched roof, and this best explains the 
epithet ‘thousand-eyed’ (i.e., with countless holes) ascribed to 
it. In the other Atharvaveda passage
	10 he accepts the sense 
‘net,’ and doubts if the word in the Rigveda is not an adjective 
(a-kṣu) as it is taken by Sāyaṇa. See also Gṛha. 1) viii. 8, 18 (akṣujālābhyām); ix. 3, 18. 2) i. 180, 5. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Dictionary, s.v. 5) Vedische Studien, 1, 136. 6) Av. viii. 8, 18. 7) Av. i. 180, 5. 8) ix. 3, 18. 9) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 598. 10) Av. viii. 8, 18.

अगस्ति
अगस्ति
 — This form of Agastya's name occurs once in the 
Atharvaveda,
	1 where he appears as a favourite of Mitra and 
Varuṇa. 1) iv. 9, 3. Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 127, n. 5.

अगस्त्य
अगस्त्य
 — This is the name of a sage, of mythical character, 
who plays a great part in the later literature. He was a Māna,
	1 
and therefore is called Mānya
	2 and son of Māna, and only once 
is there a reference
	3 to the legend prevalent in latter times that 
he was a son of Mitra and Varuṇa. 
His greatest feat was the reconciliation of Indra and the 
Maruts after Indra had been annoyed at his proposing to give 
the Maruts an offering to the exclusion of Indra. This feat is 
the subject of three hymns of the Rigveda,
	4 and is often referred 
to in the Brāhmaṇas,
	5 though the exact details and significance 
of the legend are variously treated by Oldenberg,
	6 Sieg,
	7 Hertel,
	8 
and von Schroeder.
	9 
He also appears in a strange dialogue with Lopāmudrā in 
the Rigveda,
	10 which appears to show him as an ascetic who 
finally yields to temptation. Von Schroeder
	11 regards it as 
a ritual drama of vegetation magic. 
In another passage of the Rigveda
	12 he appears as helping 
in the Aśvins’ gift of a leg to Viśpalā. Sāyaṇa holds that be 
was the Purohita of Khela, and Sieg
	13 accepts this view, while 
Pischel
	14 thinks that Khela is a deity, Vivasvant. 
Geldner
	15 shows from the Rigveda
	16 that Agastya, as brother 
of Vasiṣṭha — both being miraculous sons of Mitra and Varuṇa 
-introduces Vasiṣṭha to the Tṛtsus. There are two other 
references to Agastya in the Rigveda, the one
	17 including him 
in a long list of persons, the other alluding to his sister's sons 
(nadbhyaḥ),
	18 apparently Bandhu, etc. In the Atharvaveda
	19 
he appears as connected with witchcraft, and in a long list of 
sages.
	20 In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	21 cows, with a peculiar 
mark on their ears (viṣṭya-karṇyaḥ), are associated with him. 1) Rv. vii. 33, 10 (Agastya), 13 (Māna). 2) Rv. i. 165, 15 = 166, 15 = 167, 11 =

this reason the Rigveda Anukramaṇī 
ascribes to him (Rv. i. 191) a magic 
hymn. 20) xviii. 3, 15. 21) iv. 2, 9.

अगर
 — This rare word is found as ‘house’ in the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad.

also in Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 7, 21.

अग्निदग्ध
अग्नि-दग्ध
 — This epithet (‘burnt with fire’)
	1 applies to 
the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre. This is one 
of the two normal methods of disposing of the dead, the other 
being burial (an-agnidagdhāḥ, ‘not burnt with fire’).
	2 The 
Atharvaveda
	3 adds two further modes of disposal to those — 
viz., casting out (paroptāḥ), and the exposure of the dead 
(uddhitāḥ). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful. 
Zimmer
	4 considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian 
practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and 
that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless.
	5 
Whitney
	6 refers the latter expression to the exposure of the 
dead body on a raised platform of some sort. 
Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole 
hymn
	7 describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was 
buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and 
probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany 
him, in accordance with a practice common among savage 
tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a 
modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the 
dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband 
by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set 
between the dead and the living to separate them. In the 
Atharvaveda,
	8 but not in the Rigveda, a coffin (vṛkṣa) is alluded 
to. In both Saṃhitās
	9 occur other allusions to the ‘house 
of earth’ (bhūmi-gṛha). To remove the apparent discrepancy 
between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to 
burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg,
	10 
is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted 
side by side in Greece for many years. 
Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily 
in frequency, for in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	11 the adornment 
of the body of the dead with curd (Āmikṣā), clothes, and 
ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as 
something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	12 only burning seems to be contemplated; 
the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial 
of the ashes in the burying-ground (śmaśāna).
	13 The body was 
wrapped in fat,
	14 as we learn from the funeral hymn in the 
Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it,
	15 to act as 
a guide on the way to the next world. According to the 
Atharvaveda
	16 a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead 
to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead 
would revive with his whole body and all his limbs (sarva-tanūḥ 
sāṅgaḥ),
	17 although it is also said
	18 that the eye goes to the sun, 
the breath to the wind, and so forth. 
Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed,
	19 a clog 
(kūdī) being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning 
to earth.

अग्नि-भू काश्यप
 is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa

अग्निशाल
अग्नि-शाल
 — This term, which designates part of the sacrificial 
apparatus,
	1 is applied in the Atharvaveda
	2 to a part of an 
ordinary house, presumably the central hall where the fire
place was. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 18. 2) ix. 3, 7.

अघा
अघा
 — In the wedding hymn of the Rigveda
	1 it is said that 
cows are slain in the Aghās, and the wedding takes place at the 
Arjunīs (dual). The Atharvaveda
	2 has the ordinary Maghās 
instead. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the read
ing of the Rigveda was deliberately altered because of the con
nection of the slaughter of kine with sin (agha) — possibly, too, 
with a further desire to emphasize the contrast with aghnyā, 
a name for ‘cow.’ Moreover, in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	3 
occurs the formula ‘Svāhā to the Maghās, Svāhā to the 
Anaghās.’ See also Nakṣatra. 1) x. 85, 13. 2) xiv. 1, 13. 3) iii. 1, 4, 8.

 — See Māṃsa.

अङ्क
अङ्क
 — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 and Brāhmaṇa
	2 refer to two 
Aṅkas and two Nyaṅkas as parts of a chariot. The meaning 
of these terms is quite obscure. The commentators refer them 
to the sides or wheels. Zimmer
	3 compares the Greek 
	4 
and thinks that the Aṅkau were the upper border of the body 
of the chariot (kośa, vandhura), and the Nyaṅkau the lower rims 
for greater security. Oldenberg
	5 confesses that the exact sense 
is impossible to make out, but considers that the terms at once 
refer to parts of the chariot and to divinities, while Böhtlingk
	6 
takes the term as referring to divinities alone. 1) i. 7, 7, 2. 2) ii. 7, 8, 1. Cf. Pañcaviṃśa Brāh

अङ्ग
अङ्ग
 — The name occurs only once in the Atharvaveda
	1 in 
connection with the Gandhāris, Mūjavants, and Magadhas, as 
distinct peoples. They appear also in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 
in the compound name Aṅga-magadhāḥ. As in later times they 
were settled on the Sone and Ganges,
	3 their earlier seat was 
presumably there also. See also Vaṅga. 1) v. 22, 14. 2) ii. 9. 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 35; 
Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
446, 449; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal 
Asiatic Society, 1908, 852, inclines to 
regard them as a non-Aryan people 
that came over-sea to Eastern India. 
There is nothing in the Vedic litera
ture to throw light on this hypothesis.

अङ्गवैरोचन

 — He is included in the list of anointed 
kings in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.

an Ātreya. 1) viii. 22. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 
42, 214.

अङ्गारावक्षयण
अङ्गारावक्षयण
 — A word of doubtful meaning found 
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 It is rendered ‘tongs’ by 
Max Müller and Böhtlingk in their translations. The St. 
Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a vessel in which coals 
are extinguished,’ and Monier-Williams as ‘an instrument for 
extinguishing coals.’ The smaller St. Petersburg Dictionary 
renders the word ‘coal-shovel or tongs.’ Cf. Ulmukāva- 
kṣayaṇa. 1) iii. 9, 18.

अङ्गिरस्
अङ्गिरस्
 — The Aṅgirases appear in the Rigveda
	1 as semi
mythical beings, and no really historical character can be 
assigned even to those passages
	2 which recognize a father of 
the race, Aṅgiras. Later, however, there were definite families 
of Aṅgirases, to whose ritual practices (ayana, dvirātra) references 
are made.

 — This is the ordinary name for goat in the Rigveda
	1 
and the later literature. The goat is also called Basta, Chāga, 
Chagala. Goats and sheep (ajāvayaḥ) are very frequently 
mentioned together.
	2 The female goat is spoken of as pro
ducing two or three kids,
	3 and goat's milk is well known.
	4 
The goat as representative of Pūṣan plays an important part 
in the ritual of burial.

was a recognized one, being distinguished from that of a cow
herd and of a shepherd.

 — The Ajas are named in one verse of the Rigveda
	1 as 
having been defeated by the Tṛtsus under Sudās. They are 
there mentioned with the Yakṣus and Śigrus, and Zimmer
	2 
conjectures that they formed part of a confederacy under 
Bheda against Sudās. The name has been regarded as a sign 
of totemism,

 — The Ājamīḍhas, or descendants of Ajamīḍha, 
are referred to in a hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 Ludwig

demon-destroyer in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Its other name is 
Arāṭakī.

the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
	1 and Kauṣītaki
	2 Upaniṣads, where he in
structs the proud Brāhmaṇa Bālāki as to the real nature of

अज्ञातयक्ष्म
अज्ञात-यक्ष्म,
 the ‘unknown sickness,’ is mentioned in 
the Rigveda,
	1 Atharvaveda,
	2 and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	3 It is 
referred to in connection with Rājayakṣma. Grohmann
	4 thinks 
that the two are different forms of disease, hypertrophy and 
atrophy, the purpose of the spell in the Rigveda being thus the 
removal of all disease. From the Atharvaveda
	5 he deduces its 
identity with Balāsa. Zimmer,
	6 however, points out that this 
conclusion is unjustified, leaving the disease unidentified, which 
seems to accord with its name. 1) x. 161, 1 = Av. iii. 11, 1. 2) vi. 127, 3. 3) xiii. 16. 4) Indische Studien, 9, 400. 5) vi. 127. 3. 6) Altindisches Leben, 377, 378.

अजिन
अजिन
 — This word denotes generally the skin of an animal 
-e.g., a gazelle,
	1 as well as that of a goat (Aja).
	2 The use 
of skins as clothing is shown by the adjective ‘clothed in skins’ 
(ajina-vāsin) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 and the furrier's trade 
is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	4 The Maruts also 
wear deer-skins,

अतिथि
अतिथि
 (‘guest’). — A hymn of the Atharvaveda
	1 celebrates in 
detail the merits of hospitality. The guest should be fed before 
the host eats, water should be offered to him, and so forth. 
The Taittirīya Upaniṣad
	2 also lays stress on hospitality, using 
the expression ‘one whose deity is his guest’ (atithi-deva). In 
the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	3 it is said that only the good are deemed 
worthy of receiving hospitality. The guest-offering forms a 
regular part of the ritual,
	4 and cows were regularly slain in 
honour of guests.

अतिथिग्व
अतिथि-ग्व
 — This name occurs frequently in the Rigveda, 
apparently applying, in nearly all cases, to the same king, 
otherwise called Divodāsa. The identity of the two persons 
has been denied by Bergaigne,
	1 but is certainly proved by a 
number of passages, when the two names occur together,
	2 in 
connection with the defeat of Śambara. In other passages
	3 
Atithigva is said to have assisted Indra in slaying Parṇaya and 
Karañja. Sometimes he is only vaguely referred to, while once
	5 he 
is mentioned as an enemy of Turvaśa and Yadu. Again
	6 Atithigva 
is coupled with Āyu and Kutsa as defeated by Tūrvayāṇa. 
A different Atithigva appears to be referred to in a Dānastuti
	7 
(‘Praise of Gifts’), where his son, Indrota, is mentioned. 
Roth
	8 distinguishes three Atithigvas — the Atithigva Divodāsa, 
the enemy of Parṇaya and Karañja, and the enemy of Tūrvayāṇa. 
But the various passages can be reconciled, especially if it is 
admitted that Atithigva Divodāsa was already an ancient hero 
in the earliest hymns, and was becoming almost mythical.

the name ‘presenting cows to guests.’ 4) Rv. vi. 26, 3.

अत्क
1. Atka. — This word occurs frequently in the Rigveda, but its 
sense is doubtful. Roth, Grassmann, Ludwig, Zimmer,
	1 and 
others render it as ‘garment’ in several passages,
	2 when the 
expressions ‘put on’ (vyā or prati muñc) or ‘put off’ (muñc) are 
used of it, and when it is said to be ‘woven’ (vyuta)
	3 or ‘well
fitting’ (surabhi).
	4 On the other hand, Pischel
	5 denies that this 
sense occurs, and otherwise explains the passages. He takes 
the term to mean ‘axe’ in four places.

अत्क
2. Atka. — In two passages of the Rigveda
	1 this word is 
regarded as a proper name by Roth, Grassmann, and Ludwig. 
But Zimmer
	2 explains it in these passages as the ‘armour of a 
warrior as a whole,’ and Pischel
	3 thinks that in both cases an 
‘axe’ is meant. 1) x. 49, 3; 99, 9. 2) Altindisches Leben, 262, 297. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 195.

अत्यंहसारुणि
अत्य्-अंहस् आरुणि
 — According to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 
(iii. 10, 9, 3-5), this teacher sent a pupil to question Plakṣa 
Dayyāṃpati as to the Sāvitra (a form of Agni). For this 
impertinence his pupil was severely rebuked.

अत्यरातिजानंतपि
अत्य्-अराति जानं-तपि,
 though not a prince, was taught the 
Rājasūya by Vāsiṣṭha Satyahavya, and thereupon conquered 
the earth. When Vāsiṣṭha reminded him of his indebtedness, 
and claimed a great reward, the warrior replied irascibly that 
he intended to conquer the Uttara Kurus, and that Vāsiṣṭha 
would then become King of the Earth, Atyarāti himself being 
his general (senā-pati). Vāsiṣṭha replied that as no mortal man 
could conquer the Uttara Kurus he was cheated of his reward. 
He consequently procured Atyarāti's defeat and death at the 
hands of Amitratapana Śuṣmiṇa Śaibya.

अत्रि
अत्रि
 — Neither Atri himself nor the Atris can claim any 
historical reality,
	1 beyond the fact that Maṇḍala V. of the Rigveda 
is attributed, no doubt correctly, to the family of the Atris.
	2 
The Atris as a family probably stood in close relations with the 
Priyamedhas
	3 and Kaṇvas,
	4 perhaps also with the Gotamas
	5 
and Kākṣīvatas.
	6 The mention of both the Paruṣṇī and the 
Yamunā in one hymn
	7 of the fifth Maṇḍala seems to justify the 
presumption that the family was spread over a wide extent of 
territory. 1) For Atri in the Rigveda, see Mac

अथरी
अथरी
 — This word occurs only in the Rigveda,
	1 and the 
sense is doubtful. Roth,
	2 followed by most interpreters, 
renders it ‘point of a lance,’ but Pischel
	3 thinks that it means 
‘an elephant.’ 1) iv. 6, 8. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 99.

अथर्वन्
अथर्वन्
 — The name in the singular denotes the head of a 
semi-divine family of mythical priests,
	1 of whom nothing his
torical can be said. In the plural the family as a whole is 
meant. In a few places an actual family seems to be referred 
to. Thus, for instance, they are mentioned as recipients of 
gifts in the Dānastuti
	2 (‘Praise of Gifts’), of Aśvattha's 
generosity; their use of milk mingled with honey in the ritual 
is referred to;
	3 and a cow that miscarries (ava-tokā) from accident 
is dedicated to the Atharvans, according to the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa.

अथर्वाण|अथर्वाणः
अथर्वाणः
 — This expression
	1 is used with Aṅgirasaḥ, to 
denote the Atharvaveda. The compound Atharvāṅgirasaḥ is 
employed in the same sense. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 9, 1; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 10, 10; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 5 
et seq.

अथर्वाङ्गिरस|अथर्वाङ्गिरसः
अथर्वाङ्गिरसः
 — This is the collective name of the Athar
vaveda in several passages
	1 of the later Brāhmaṇas. It occurs 
once in the Atharvaveda itself,
	2 while the term Atharvaveda 
is not found before the Sūtra period.
	3 The compound seems, 
according to Bloomfield,
	4 to denote the two elements which 
make up the Atharvaveda. The former part refers to the aus
picious practices of the Veda (bheṣajāni);
	5 the latter to its hostile 
witchcraft, the yātu
	6 or abhi-cāra.
	7 This theory is supported by 
the names of the two mythic personages Ghora Āṅgirasa and 
Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa, as well as by the connection of Atharvāṇaḥ 
and Ātharvaṇāni with healing (bheṣaja) in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	8 Moreover, the term bhesajā (‘remedies’) designates 
in the Atharvaveda
	9 that Veda itself, while in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	10 yātu (‘sorcery’) conveys the same meaning. The 
evidence, however, being by no means convincing, it remains 
probable that there existed no clear differentiation between the 
two sages as responsible for the Atharvaveda as a whole. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 8, 2;

अदृष्ट
अ-दृष्ट
 — ‘The unseen’ is a term used in the Rigveda
	1 
and the Atharvaveda
	2 to designate a species of vermin. The 
sun is also described as ‘the slayer of the unseen’ (adṛṣṭa-han),
	3 
and as a counterpart a ‘seen’ (dṛṣṭa) is mentioned.
	4 In one 
passage
	5 the epithets ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ are applied to the 
worm (Kṛmi), their use being no doubt due to the widespread 
theory of diseases being due to worms, whether discernable by 
examination or not.

अद्मसद्
अद्म-सद्
 — This expression (lit. ‘sitting at the meal’), found 
several times in the Rigveda,
	1 is usually rendered ‘guest at the 
feast,’ but Geldner
	2 adduces reasons to show that it means ‘a 
fly,’ so called because of its settling on food. 1) i. 124, 4; vi. 30, 3; vii. 83, 7;

अद्रि
अद्रि
 — Zimmer
	1 deduces from the use of this word (‘rock,’ 
‘stone’) in a passage of the Rigveda,
	2 that sling-stones were 
used in Vedic fighting. But the passage is mythical, referring 
to Indra's aid, and cannot be used with any certainty as 
evidence for human war. More probably it merely denotes 
Indra's bolt. See also Aśani. 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) i. 51, 3.

अधिदेवन
अधि-देवन
 — The place where the dice were thrown is thus 
designated in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 
according to Lüders.
	3 Roth,
	4 followed by Whitney, takes it to 
mean ‘gambling-board.’ See Akṣa. 1) v. 31, 6; vi. 70, 1. 2) v. 4, 4, 20. 22, 23. 3) Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien, 11-13. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

अधिराज
अधि-राज
 — The word occurs fairly often throughout the 
early literature,
	1 denoting ‘overlord’ among kings or princes. 
In no passage is it clear that a real over-king is meant, as 
the word rājan may mean king or merely prince, a person of 
royal blood. On the whole it seems most probable that the 
word connotes no more than ‘king’ as opposed to ‘prince.’ 1) Rv. x. 128, 9 Av. vi. 98, 1; ix. 10, 
24; Taiturīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 14, 2;

Saṃhitā, viii. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 1, 2, 9 (adhirājan); Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, v. 4, 2, 2; Nirukta, viii. 2.

अधिषवण
अधि-षवण
 — The two Adhiṣavaṇas
	1 are usually understood, 
as by Roth
	2 and Zimmer,
	3 to designate the two boards between 
which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt,
	4 however, shows 
from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the 
other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving 
as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone. 
This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense 
of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as 
an adjective (‘used for pressing upon’). But according to the 
procedure as witnessed by Haug
	5 in the Deccan, the shoots of 
the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being 
then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots 
are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second 
board being then laid over them. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 21; 
Av. v. 20, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 9, 4, 1; 5, 3, 22 (adhiṣavaṇe 
phalake); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 32 
(adhiṣavaṇaṃ carma, ‘the skin upon 
which the pressing takes place’; 
adhiṣavaṇe phalake, ‘the boards on 
which the pressing takes place,’ 
etc.). 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 277. 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 148 et seq. 5) See Haug, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2, 
p. 488, n. 10.

अधीवास
अधी̆-वास
 — This word
	1 denotes the ‘upper garment’ of 
the Vedic Indian. Its exact nature is not described, but as 
the king in the ritual set forth in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 
puts on first an undergarment, then a garment, and finally an 
upper garment, it presumably denotes some sort of cloak or 
mantle. 1) Rv. i. 140, 9; 162, 16; x. 5, 4; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 5, 22 (prati- 
muñc, ‘put on’); 4, 4, 3 (ā-stṛ, ‘spread 
out’), etc. 2) v. 3, 5, 19 et seq. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
268.

अध्याण्डा

 — This is a plant mentioned with many others in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 8, 1, 16).

अध्रि-गु
 — This is the name of a man twice referred to in 
the Rigveda
	1 as a protégé of the Aśvins and of Indra respectively. 1) i. 112, 20; viii. 12, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 17, 90.

अध्वर्यु
अध्वर्यु
 — In one passage of the Rigveda
	1 Hillebrandt
	2 
thinks that the five Adhvaryus who are mentioned do not 
designate actual priests, but refer to the five planets which 
move about in the heavens like the Adhvaryu priests on the 
sacrificial ground. See also Graha. 1) iii. 7, 7. 2) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 423.

अनग्निदग्ध
अन्-अग्नि-दग्ध,
 ‘not burnt with fire.’ See Agni-dagdha, 
‘burnt with fire.’

अनड्वाह्
अनड्-वाह्
 (lit. ‘cart-drawer’). — This is the common
	1 name of 
oxen as employed for drawing carts (Anas). Such oxen were 
normally castrated,
	2 though not always. Female draft cattle 
were also used (anaḍuhī), but rarely.
	3 See also Go. 1) Rv. x. 59, 10; 85, 10; iii. 53, 18;

अनस्
अनस्
 — This is the term
	1 used to designate the draft wagon, 
as opposed to the chariot (ratha) for war or sport, with which 
it is sometimes expressly contrasted,
	2 though Indra is once said 
to be ‘seated in a wagon’ (anar-viś)
	3 instead of on a chariot. 
Though Uṣas, Goddess of Dawn, sometimes rides on a chariot 
(ratha), the wagon is her characteristic vehicle.
	4 Of its con
struction we know little. The bridal wagon on which Sūryā, 
the daughter of the Sun, was borne in the marriage hymn in the 
Rigveda had a covering (Chadis).
	5 The axle-box (Kha) is also 
mentioned.
	6 In the Atharvaveda
	7 Vipatha appears to denote a 
rough vehicle used for bad tracks. The wagon was usually 
drawn by oxen (Anaḍvāh), as in wedding processions.
	8 The 
wagon of Dawn is described as drawn by ruddy cows or bulls.

अनु
अनु, आनव
 — Grassmann and Roth
	1 see in these words 
designations of people foreign to the Aryans. But it is clear
	2 
that they denote a special people, the Anus, who are mentioned 
with the Yadus, Turvaśas, Druhyus, and Pūrus,
	3 with the 
Druhyus,
	4 and with the Turvaśas, Yadus, and Druhyus.
	5 It 
is also a fair conclusion from their mention in a passage of the 
Rigveda
	6 that they dwelt on the Paruṣṇī. The inference that 
the Bhṛgus were connected with this tribe is much more 
doubtful,
	7 for it rests solely on the fact that in one place
	8 the 
Bhṛgus and Druhyus are mentioned together, and not Anus and 
Druhyus. Ānava is used as an epithet of Agni,
	9 but also in the 
sense of ‘Anu prince,’
	10 in one case in conjunction with Turvaśa.

अनुक्षत्तृ
अनु-क्षत्तृ
 — This word occurs in the list of victims at the 
Puruṣamedha,
	1 and means, according to Mahīdhara,
	2 ‘an 
attendant on the door-keeper,’ and, according to Sāyaṇa, ‘an 
attendant on the charioteer’ (sārathi). See also Kṣattṛ.

अनुवक्तृसत्यसात्यकीर्त
अनु-वक्तृ सत्य सात्य-कीर्त
 is mentioned as a teacher in 
the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa Upaniṣad (i. 5, 4).

अनुव्याख्यान
अनुव्या-ख्यान
 is a species of writing referred to in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 Śaṅkara interprets it as ‘explana
tion of the Mantras.’ As the term, in the plural, follows 
Sūtras, this interpretation is reasonable. Sieg,
	2 however, 
equates the word with Anvākhyāna, ‘supplementary narrative.’ 1) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11. 2) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 34.

अनुशासन
अनु-शासन
 in the plural denotes in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
(xi. 5, 6, 8) some form of literature; according to Sāyaṇa, the 
Vedāṅgas.

अनुशिख

 is the name of the Potṛ at the snake festival in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxv. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

अन्तेवासिन्
अन्ते-वासिन्,
 ‘dwelling near,’ is the epithet of the Brahma-

often enjoined on others than Antevāsins.

अन्ध्र
अन्ध्र
 is the name of a people, and is mentioned with the 
Puṇḍras, Śabaras, Pulindas, and Mūtibas, as being the outcasts 
resulting from the refusal of the fifty eldest sons of Viśvāmitra 
to accept his adoption of Śunaḥśepa.
	1 It may fairly be deduced 
from this statement that these people were recognized as non
Aryan, as the Andhras certainly seem to have been.
	2 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18; Śāṅkh
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 26, where 
instead of udāntyaḥ (‘beyond the 
borders’) the reading is udañcaḥ (‘nor
thern’), but the former is obviously 
correct. The Sāṅkhāyana omits the 
Pulindas, and has Mūcīpas. 2) Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der Deut- 
schen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 
657 et seq., who places them originally 
in Eastern India between the Kṛṣṇā 
and Godāvarī rivers; cf. Rapson,

Bhandarkar, Bombay Gazetteer, 1. ii. 
138.

अन्यतःप्लक्षा
अन्यतः-प्लक्षा
 (‘with wave-leafed fig-trees on one side 
only’) is the name of a lake in Kurukṣetra according to the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where it occurs in the story of Purū
ravas and Urvaśī. Pischel
	2 places it somewhere in Sirmor. 1) xi. 5, 1, 4. 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 217.

अन्यवाप
अन्य-वाप
 (‘sowing for others’). — The cuckoo is so called
	1 
from its habit of depositing its eggs in the nests of other birds 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 37; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 18.

अन्वाख्यान
अन्वा-ख्यान
 — From the literal translation (‘after-story’) the 
meaning of ‘supplementary narrative’ seems to follow. In two
	1 
of its three occurrences in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa this sense 
is hardly felt, the expression being used to indicate a subse
quent portion of the book itself. But in the third
	2 passage it 
is distinguished from the Itihāsa (‘story’) proper, and there 
must mean ‘supplementary narrative.’ Cf. Anuvyākhyāna. 1) vi. 5, 2, 22; 6, 4, 7 (the reference 
is to vi. 6, 4, 8). 2) xi. 1, 6, 9. 
Cf. Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 34.

अपचित्
अप-चित्
 — This word occurs several times in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
It is held by Roth,
	2 Zimmer,
	3 and others to denote an insect 
whose sting produced swellings, etc. (glau). But Bloomfield
	4 
shows that the disease, scrofulous swellings, is what is really 
meant, as is shown by the rendering (gaṇḍa-mālā, ‘inflammation 
of the glands of the neck’) of Keśava and Sāyaṇa, and by the 
parallelism of the later disease, apacī, the derivation being from 
apa and ci, ‘to pick off.’ 1) vi. 25, 1; 83, 1; vii. 75, 1; 77, 1. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 97. So also

अपस्कम्भ
अप-स्कम्भ
 — The word occurs only in one passage of the 
Atharvaveda, where the tip of it is mentioned as poisoned. 
Roth
	1 suggests that the fastening of the arrow-point to the 
shaft is meant. Whitney
	2 inclines to this version, but suggests 
corruption of text. Zimmer
	3 follows Roth. Ludwig
	4 renders 
the word by ‘barb.’ Bloomfield
	5 thinks it means ‘tearing 
(arrow),’ a sense deduced from the etymology. 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

 — The kings of the ‘Westerners’ are referred to in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14) in connection with those of 
the Nīcyas.

अपान
अपान
 — The word appears repeatedly in the Atharvaveda,
	1 
and later as one of the vital breaths (Prāṇa), usually with 
Prāṇa, and often with one or more of the other three. Its 
original sense
	2 appears to have been ‘inspiration.’ Its con
nection with the lower part of the body (nābhi, ‘navel’), which 
is found already in the Aitareya Upaniṣad,
	3 is not unnatural. 1) Av. ii. 28, 3; v. 30, 12, etc.; Vāja

अपामार्ग
अपा-मार्ग
 — A plant (Achyranthes aspera) used frequently
	1 in 
witchcraft practices, and for medical purposes, especially against 
Kṣetriya. It is described in the Atharvaveda
	2 as ‘revertive’ 
(punaḥ-sara), either, as Roth
	3 and Zimmer
	4 think, because of 
its having reverted leaves (a view also accepted by Whitney
	5 ), 
or because, as Bloomfield
	6 holds, it wards off a spell by 
causing it to recoil on its user. 1) Atharvaveda, iv. 17, 6; 18, 7;

अपी
अपी
 — Ludwig
	1 finds an Apī whose sons are described as 
not performing sacrifice (a-yajña-sāc) and as breakers of the 
law of Mitra-Varuṇa in the Rigveda.
	2 Roth
	3 and Grassmann 
take the expression used (apyaḥ putrāḥ) as referring to the sons 
of the waters. 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158, 
159. 2) vi. 67, 9. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., apya.

अपूप
अपूप
 is the general word from the Rigveda
	1 onwards for a 
cake, which might be mixed with ghee (ghṛtavant),
	2 or be 
made of rice (vrīhi),
	3 or of barley (yava).
	4 In the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad
	5 there is a difference of interpretation. Max Müller 
renders it as ‘hive,’ Böhtlingk as ‘honeycomb,’ Little
	6 as 
‘cake.’ 1) iii. 52, 7. 2) Rv. x. 45, 9. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 3, 12, 13. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 5, 19. 5) iii. 1, 1. 6) Grammatical Index, s.v.

अप्नवान
अप्नवान
 appears only twice in the Rigveda
	1 as an ancient 
sage, coupled with the Bhṛgus, to whose family Ludwig
	2 con
jectures him to have belonged. 1) iv. 7, 1; viii. 91, 4. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 128.

अप्रतिरथ
अ-प्रति-रथ
 (‘he who has no match in fight’) is the name 
of an obviously invented Ṛṣi, to whom is ascribed by the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 the composition 
of a Rigveda hymn
	3 celebrating Indra as the invincible warrior. 1) viii. 10. 2) ix. 2, 3, 1. 5. 3) x. 103.

अप्वा
अप्वा
 — A disease affecting the stomach,
	1 possibly dysentery, 
as suggested by Zimmer,
	2 on the ground that the disease is 
invoked to confound the enemy.
	3 Weber
	4 considers that it is 
diarrhœa induced by fear, as often in the Epic.
	5 This view is 
supported by Bloomfield,
	6 and was apparently that of Yāska.

अप्सस्
अप्सस्
 — This word usually refers to the body, meaning 
‘front part.’
	1 In one passage of the Rigveda,
	2 however, the 
adjective ‘with a long front part’ (dīrghāpsas) is applied to the 
chariot (Ratha). 1) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 
308-313; 2, 245, 246. 2) i. 122, 15. Cf. Roth, St. Peters
burg Dictionary, s.v.

अभिक्रोशक
अभि-क्रोशक
 designates one of the victims in the Puruṣa
medha, meaning, perhaps, ‘herald.’ The commentator Mahī
dhara
	1 renders it as ‘reviler’ (nindaka). 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20. Cf. Anukrośaka, Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,

 See Ahan.

अभिप्रतारिन्काक्षसेनि
अभि-प्रतारिन् काक्ष-सेनि
 is mentioned in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,
	1 the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	2 and the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	3 as engaged in discussions on philo
sophy. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	4 further reports that his 
sons divided the property amongst themselves while he was 
yet alive. He was a Kuru and a prince. 1) i. 59, 1; iii. 1, 21; 2, 2. 13. 2) iv. 3, 5. 3) x. 5, 7; xiv. 1, 12. 15. 4) iii. 156 (Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 26, 61).

अभिप्रश्निन्
अभि-प्रश्निन्
 — This term occurs after Praśnin, and followed 
by Praśnavivāka in the list of victims for the Puruṣamedha 
given in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	2 
The commentators, Sāyaṇa and Mahīdhara, see in it merely a 
reference to an inquisitive man. But there can be little doubt 
that the term must have had a legal reference of some sort — 
perhaps indicating the defendant as opposed to plaintiff and 
judge. 1) iii. 4, 6, 1. 2) xxx. 10.

अभिश्री
अभि-श्री
 (‘admixture’). — This word
	1 designates the milk used 
to mingle with the Soma juice before it was offered. 1) Rv. ix. 79, 5; 86, 27. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227; Hillebrandt, 
Vedische Mythologie, i. 211.

अभिषवणी
अभि-षवणी
 — Zimmer
	1 renders the expression in the 
Atharvaveda
	2 as a pressing instrument, but it appears to be 
merely an adjective, (waters) ‘used in pressing.’
	3 1) Altindisches Leben, 277. 2) ix. 6, 16. 3) Cf. Whitney's Translation of Av. 
ix. 6, 16.

अभिषेक
अभि-षेक
 (‘besprinkling’). — The Vedic king was conse
crated after his election with an elaborate ritual, which is fully 
described in the Taittirīya,
	1 Pañcaviṃśa,
	2 Śatapatha,
	3 and 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇas,
	4 and for which the Mantras are given in 
the Saṃhitās.
	5 The consecration took place by sprinkling with 
water (abhiṣecanīyā āpaḥ).
	6 Only kings could be consecrated, 
the people not being worthy of it (anabhiṣecanīyāḥ).
	7 The 
sprinkler (abhiṣektṛ) is mentioned in the list of victims at the 
Puruṣamedha.
	8 The Abhiṣeka is an essential part of the 
Rājasūya, or sacrifice of royal inauguration, being the second 
of its component members.

अभीशु
अभीशु
 is a common Vedic word
	1 denoting the ‘reins’ or 
‘bridle’ of the chariot horses. The use of the plural is due to 
the fact that two or four horses, possibly five (daśābhīśu ‘ten
bridled’),
	2 were yoked to the car. 1) Rv. i. 38, 12; v. 44, 4; vi. 75, 6; 
viii. 33, 11; Av. vi. 137, 2; viii. 8, 22; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 6; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 3, 14 (where it 
= raśmayaḥ, ‘reins’), etc. 2) Rv. x. 94, 7.

अभ्यग्निऐतशायन
अभ्य्-अग्नि ऐतशायन
 — This man was, according to the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 unfortunate enough to quarrel with his 
father, Aitaśa. The result was that he and his progeny were 
called the worst of the Aurvas. In the version of the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 the Aitaśāyana Ājāneyas take the place of the 
Abhyagnis and the Bhṛgus of the Aurvas, the latter being 
probably a branch of the former family. 1) vi. 33. 2) xxx. 5. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173.

अभ्यावर्तिन्चायमान
अभ्या-वर्तिन् चायमान
 appears in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of 
Gifts’) in the Rigveda,
	1 and as conqueror of the Vṛcīvants 
under the leader Varaśikha. It is probable though not abso
lutely certain, that he is identical with the Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, 
mentioned in the same hymn
	2 as having the Turvaśas and 
Vṛcīvants defeated for him by Indra. In this case he would 
be prince (samrāj) of the Sṛñjayas. Daivavāta is mentioned 
elsewhere
	3 as a worshipper of Agni. 
Abhyāvartin is also referred to as a Pārthava. Ludwig
	4 and 
Hillebrandt
	5 maintained that he is thus a Parthian, the latter 
using the evidence of the two places mentioned in the descrip
tion
	6 of Daivavāta's victories, Hariyūpīyā and Yavyāvatī, as 
proofs for the western position of Abhyāvartin's people in 
Arachosia, in Iran. But Zimmer
	7 is probably right in holding 
that the name Pārthava merely means ‘a descendant of Pṛthu,’ 
and that its similarity to the Iranian Parthians is only on a par 
with the numerous other points of identity between the Indian 
and Iranian cultures. 1) vi. 27, 8. 5. 2) vi. 27, 7. 3) iv. 15, 4. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 198

अभ्रातरः
अ-भ्रातरः
 (‘brotherless’). — The lot of girls without brothers 
is referred to in the Rigveda
	1 as unsatisfactory — apparently 
they became prostitutes. The Nirukta
	2 expressly forbids 
marriage with a brotherless maiden, probably because of the 
risk of her being made a putrikā (‘adoptive daughter’) by her 
father — that is, any son of hers being counted as belonging to 
her father's, instead of to her husband's, family. See Ayogū. 1) i. 124, 7; iv. 5, 5. Cf. Av. 
i. 17, 1. 2) iii. 5 (abhrātrī). 
Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 259; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben,

अभ्रि
अभ्रि
 (‘spade’) is a Vedic word
	1 of frequent occurrence. 
Various possible materials and forms are enumerated in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 It may be made of bamboo or of the wood 
of Vikaṅkata or Udumbara. It may be a span or a cubit in size. 
It is hollow, and either one or both edges are sharp. From 
this it would appear that the handle was made of some wood, 
but the head of some metal. 1) Av. iv. 7, 5. 6 (abhri-khāte is ‘dug 
out with a spade,’ not ‘prepared 
ground’ with Roth, St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v.); x. 4, 14; hiraṇya- 
yībhir abhribhiḥ, ‘with golden spades’); 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, v. 22; xi. 10;

6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 2, 15, 
etc. 2) vi. 3, 1, 30 et seq.

अमत्र
अमत्र
 was a vessel into which the Soma, after being 
pressed, was poured,
	1 and out of which the libation to the god 
was made.
	2 1) Rv. ii. 14, 1; v. 51, 4; vi. 42, 2, etc. 2) Rv. x. 29, 7. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 278; 
Oldenberg, Ṛgveda Noten, 1, 61.

अमला
अमला
 — This plant
	1 is probably the Emblica officinalis, or 
Myrobalan tree; also called Āmalaka, or Āmalakā.
	2 1) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 38, 6. 2) The reading in Chāndogya Upani
ṣad, vii. 3, 1, is vāmalake, which may 
give ă° or ā°.

अमाजुर्
अमा-जुर्
 is an epithet
	1 denoting maidens ‘who grow old at 
home’ without finding husbands, or, as they are elsewhere 
called, ‘who sit with their father’ (pitṛ-ṣad). A well-known 
example of such was Ghoṣā.
	2 1) Rv. ii. 17, 7; viii. 21, 15; 
x. 37, 3. 2) Rv. i. 117, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 305.

अमावास्यशाण्डिल्यायन
अमा-वास्य शाण्डिल्यायन
 is mentioned in the Vaṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the teacher of Aṃśu Dhānaṃjayya. 1) Indische Studien, iv. 373.

अमित्रतपनशुष्मिणशैब्य
अमित्र-तपन शुष्मिण शैब्य
 is the name of him 
who killed Atyarāti Jānaṃtapi, according to the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa (viii. 23).

अमूला
अ-मूला
 (‘without root’) is the name in the Atharvaveda
	1 of 
a plant (Methonica superba), which was used for poisoning 
arrows. Bloomfield,
	2 however, renders it as ‘movable property.’ 1) v. 314. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
18, 286; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 279, accepts ‘rootless 
(plant).’ 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 457.

अम्बरीष
अम्बरीष
 is mentioned as a Vārṣāgira in the Rigveda
	1 along 
with Ṛjrāśva, Sahadeva, Surādhas, and Bhayamāna. 1) i. 100, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 140.

अयस्
अयस्
 — The exact metal denoted by this word when used by 
itself, as always in the Rigveda,
	1 is uncertain. As favouring the 
sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be 
cited with Zimmer
	2 the fact that Agni is called ayo-daṃṣṭra, 
‘with teeth of Ayas,’
	3 with reference to the colour of his flames, 
and that the car-seat of Mitra and Varuṇa is called ayaḥ-sthūṇa,
	4 
‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun.
	5 Moreover, 
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	6 Ayas is enumerated in a list of six 
metals: gold (hiraṇya), Ayas, Śyāma, Loha, lead (sīsa), tin 
(trapu). Here śyāma (‘swarthy’) and loha (‘red’) must mean 
‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; ayas would therefore seem to 
mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda
	7 and 
other books, the Ayas is divided into two species — the śyāma 
(‘iron’) and the lohita (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	8 a distinction is drawn between Ayas and lohāyasa, 
which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as 
understood by Eggeling,
	9 or between copper and bronze as held 
by Schrader.
	10 In one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	11 the sense of 
iron seems certain. Possibly, too, the arrow of the Rigveda,
	12 
which had a tip of Ayas (yasyā ayo mukham), was pointed 
with iron. Copper, however, is conceivable, and bronze quite 
likely. 
Iron is called śyāma ayas or śyāma alone.
	13 See also 
Kārṣṇāyasa. Copper is Lohāyasa or Lohitāyasa. 
The smelting (dhmā ‘to blow’) of the metal is frequently 
referred to. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	14 states that if ‘well 
smelted’ (bahu-dhmātam) it is like gold, referring evidently to 
bronze. A heater of Ayas is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	15 and bowls of Ayas are also spoken of.

golden appearance at the flush of 
dawn.’ 6) xviii. 13. 7) xi. 3, 1. 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,

अयस्थूण
अय-स्थूण

spoons.

अयास्यआङ्गिरस
अयास्य आङ्गिरस
 — This sage appears to be mentioned in 
two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 and the Anukramaṇī ascribes to 
him several hymns of the Rigveda (ix. 44-46; x. 67; 68). In 
the Brāhmaṇa tradition he was Udgātṛ at the Rājasūya or 
Royal Inauguration Sacrifice, at which Śunaḥśepa was to have 
been slain, and his Udgītha (Sāmaveda chant) is referred to 
elsewhere.

अयोगू
अयोगू
 is a word of quite doubtful meaning, found in the list 
of victims in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	1 It may, like the late 
āyogava, denote a member of a mixed caste (theoretically a 
descendant of a Śūdra by a Vaiśya wife).
	2 Weber
	3 rendered it 
as ‘unchaste woman.’
	4 Zimmer thinks it denotes a brotherless 
maiden who is exposed to the dangers of prostitution (cf. 
āyogava). 1) xxx. 5; Taithrīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 
1, 1. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Indische Streifen, 1, 76, n. b. In the 
Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen 
Gesellschaft, 18, 277, he thought it re
ferred to dicing (ayas). Risley, Peoples 
of India, 250, regards the Āyogavas 
as a functional caste of carpenters 
(cf. Manu, x. 48). 4) Altindisches Leben, 328.

अरण्य
अरण्य
 — This term denotes the uncultivated land — not 
necessarily forest land — beyond the village. It is contrasted 
with home (amā),
	1 and with the plough land (kṛṣi),
	2 being spoken 
of as apart (tiras) from men.
	3 It is also contrasted with the 
Grāma,
	4 and it is the place where thieves live.
	5 The character 
of the forest is described in a hymn of the Rigveda
	6 to the 
forest spirit (Araṇyānī). The dead are carried there for burial,
	7 
and hermits live there.
	8 Forest fires were common.

अरत्नि
अरत्नि
 — This word, which primarily means ‘elbow,’ occurs 
frequently from the Rigveda
	1 onwards as denoting a measure of 
length (‘ell’ or ‘cubit’), the distance from the elbow to the tip 
of the hand. The exact length nowhere appears from the early 
texts. 1) Rv. viii. 80, 8; Av. xix. 57, 6;

Rv. viii. 80, 8, see also Āji.

अराजानः
अ-राजानः,
 ‘not princes,’ is a term used to describe persons 
in two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 Weber
	3 also finds them mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda,
	4 and thinks that they — Sūtas (‘charioteers’) and 
Grāmaṇīs (‘troop-leaders’) there referred to — were called thus 
because, while not themselves princes, they assisted in the con
secration of princes. 1) iii. 4, 1, 7. 8; xiii. 4, 2, 17. 2) viii. 23. 3) Indische Studien, 17, 199. 4) iii. 5, 7, where he emends rājānaḥ

अराड दात्रेय शौनक
 — He is mentioned in the Vaṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the pupil of Dṛti Aindrota Śaunaka. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 384.

अरित्र
अरित्र
 denotes the ‘oar’ by which boats were propelled. 
The Rigveda
	1 and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	2 speak of a vessel 
with a hundred oars, and a boat (nau) is said to be ‘propelled 
by oars’ (aritra-paraṇa).
	3 In two passages of the Rigveda
	4 the

अरुन्धती
1. Arundhatī is the name of a plant celebrated in several 
passages of the Atharvaveda
	1 as possessing healing properties in 
case of wounds, as a febrifuge, and as inducing cows to give 
milk. The plant was a climber which attached itself to trees 
like the Plakṣa, Aśvattha, Nyagrodha, and Parṇa.
	2 It was 
of golden colour (hiraṇya-varṇā), and had a hairy stem (lomaśa- 
vakṣaṇā).
	3 It was also called Silācī, and the Lākṣā appears to 
have been a product of it.

अर्क
अर्क,
 as the name of the tree Colotropis gigantea, is perhaps 
found in one obscure passage of the Atharvaveda.
	1 1) vi. 72, 1, where see Whitney's note. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

अर्गल
अर्गल
 — The word which is usual later to denote the 
wooden pin of a door is found in the Śāṇkhāyana Āraṇyaka 
(ii. 16) in the compound argaleṣīke to denote the pin and bar 
of the door of a cow-pen. Cf. Iṣīkā.

अर्गलकाहोडि
अर्गल-काहोडि
 is mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Samhitā (xxv. 7) 
as a teacher. The name may, however, be Aryala, as suggested 
in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and as read by 
v. Schroeder in his edition. The Kapiṣṭhala (xxxix. 5) has 
Ayala. See below.

अर्चत्|अर्चन्त्
अर्चन्त्
 is possibly, as Ludwig
	1 thinks, the name of the author 
of a hymn of the Rigveda
	2 ; but the word may be merely the 
ordinary participle ‘praising.’ 1) Translation of the Ṛigveda, 3, 133. 2) x. 149, 5.

अर्चनानस्

 — In one passage of the Rigveda

Varuṇa are besought to protect Arcanānas. He is also in
voked with Śyāvāśva and several other ancestors enumerated 
in the Atharvaveda.
	2 He appears as father of Śyāvāśva in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	3 The later tradition makes him play a 
part in the legend of his son's wedding, which Sieg
	4 endeavours 
to show is known to the Rigveda. 1) v. 64, 7. 2) xviii. 3, 15. 3) viii. 5, 9. 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq.

अर्जुनी
अर्जुनी
 is, in the Rigveda,
	1 the name of the Nakṣatra 
(‘lunar mansion’), elsewhere
	2 called Phalgunī. It occurs in 
the marriage hymn, with Aghā for Maghā, and, like that word, 
is apparently a deliberate modification. 1) x. 85, 13. 2) Av. xiv. 1, 13. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 11, 2.

अर्बुद
अर्बुद
 is mentioned as Grāvastut priest at the snake 
festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 He is ob

spoken of in the Aitareya
	2 and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas
	3 as a maker 
of Mantras. 1) xxv. 15. 2) vi. 1. 3) xxix. 1. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
xiii. 4, 3, 9.

अर्य
अर्य
 — This word is not common in the older literature, in 
places where the quantity of the first vowel is fixed as short, except 
in a mere adjectival sense. Geldner,
	1 indeed, contends that no 
other sense is anywhere needed; but Roth
	2 and Zimmer
	3 agree 
in thinking that in several passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	4 
the word has the same sense as Ārya, and this appears probable. 
Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the 
compound arya-patnī
	5 applied to the waters set free by Indra, 
is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahīdhara,
	6 suggests 
that the word means a Vaiśya, not an Ārya generally. This 
view is supported by the explanation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	7 
of one of the passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	8 But though 
the use of Arya to denote a Vaiśya became common later, it is 
not clear that it was original. 1) Vedische Studien, 3, 96. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 214, 215. 4) xiv. 30; xx. 17; xxiii. 21; xxvi. 2. 
Cf. also Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 5;

Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, an analogous 
form occurs, as contrasted with brāh- 
maṇa, rājanya, and śūdra; but even 
there Whitney renders it as ‘Āryan.’

	2 however, 
amends the text so as to remove the name. The St. Petersburg 
Dictionary suggests that it refers to Indra. Pischel

अवत
अवत,
 a word occurring several times in the Rigveda,
	1 denotes 
a well, artificially made (khan ‘to dig’) in contrast with a spring 
(utsa), though the latter expression is also applied to an artificial 
well. Such wells were covered by the makers,
	2 and are described 
as unfailing (a-kṣita) and full of water.
	3 The water was raised 
by a wheel (cakra) of stone, to which was fastened a strap 
(varatrā), with a pail (kośa)
	4 attached to it. When raised it was 
poured (siñc) into buckets (āhāva) of wood.
	5 Sometimes those 
wells appear to have been used for irrigation purposes, the water 
being led off into broad channels (sārmī suṣirā).

अवि
अवि
 — ‘Sheep’ are repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda, and 
later, often in conjunction with goats (aja). The wolf (vṛka) 
was their great enemy,
	1 and they were tended by shepherds.
	2 
Sheep as well as kine were captured from the enemy.
	3 The 
Soma sieve was made of sheep's wool, and is repeatedly 
referred to (avi, meṣī, avya, avyaya).
	4 Considerable herds 
must have existed, as Ṛjrāśva is said
	5 to have slain one 
hundred rams, and in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’)
	6 a hundred 
sheep are mentioned as a gift. The (meṣa,
	7 vṛṣṇi
	8 ) ram was 
sometimes castrated (petva).
	9 The main use of sheep was their 
wool; hence the expression ‘woolly’ (ūrṇāvatī)
	10 is employed to 
designate a sheep. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	11 the ram is 
described as ‘woolly,’ and as ‘the skin of beasts, quadruped and 
biped,’ with reference to the use of its wool as clothing for men 
and shelter for animals. Pūṣan is said
	12 to weave raiment from 
the wool of sheep. Normally the sheep stayed out at pasture; 
in an obscure passage of the Rigveda
	13 reference appears to be 
made to rams in stall. Gandhāra
	14 ewes were famous for their 
wool. Pischel
	15 considers that the Paruṣṇī
	16 was named from 
its richness in sheep, parus
	17 denoting the ‘flocks’ of wool. 1) Av. v. 8, 4; Rv. viii. 34, 3; 66, 8. 2) Avi-pāla, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx.

अशनि
अशनि
 — Zimmer
	1 cites this word from the Rigveda
	2 as 
denoting a sling stone, and compares a similar use of Adri.
	3 
In either case, however, the weapons are mythical, being used 
in descriptions of Indra's deeds. Schrader
	4 also cites aśan in this 
sense, but no Vedic passage requires this sense. 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. 2) vi. 6, 5. Cf. 1, 121, 9. 3) i. 51, 3. 4) Prehistoric Antiquities, 221.

अश्मगन्धा
अश्म-गन्धा
 (‘rock-smell’) is a plant mentioned in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,

gandhā, ‘horse-smell’ (Physalis flexuosa). 1) xiii. 8, 1, 16, with Eggeling's note in the Sacred Books of the East, 44, 427.

अश्व
अश्व
 is the commonest word for ‘horse’ in the Vedic 
literature. The horse is also called ‘the runner’ (atya), ‘the 
swift’ (arvant), ‘the strong,’ for pulling (vājin), ‘the runner’ 
(sapti), and ‘the speeding’ (haya). The mare is termed aśvā, 
atyā, arvatī, vaḍavā, etc. Horses of various colour were known, 
dun (harita, hari), ruddy (aruṇa, aruṣa, piśaṅga, rohita), dark 
brown (śyāva), white (śveta), etc. A white horse with black 
ears is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as of special value.
	1 
Horses were highly prized,
	2 and were not rare, as Roth
	3 
thought, for as many as four hundred mares are mentioned in 
one Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’).
	4 They were on occasion 
ornamented with pearls and gold.
	5 
Mares were preferred for drawing chariots because of their 
swiftness and sureness.
	6 They were also used for drawing 
carts, but were not ordinarily so employed.
	7 No mention is 
made of riding in battle, but for other purposes it was not 
unknown.
	8 
Horses were often kept in stalls,
	9 and fed there.
	10 But they 
were also allowed to go out to grass,
	11 and were then hobbled.
	12 
They were watered to cool them after racing.
	13 Their attendants 
are frequently referred to (aśva-pāla,
	14 aśva-pa,
	15 aśva-pati).
	16 
Stallions were frequently castrated (vadhri).
	17 
Besides reins (raśmayaḥ), reference is made to halters 
(aśvābhidhānī),
	18 and whips (aśvājani).
	19 See also Ratha. 
Horses from the Indus were of special value,
	20 as also horses

अश्वतर
अश्व-तर, अश्व-तरी
 are respectively the masculine and 
feminine name of ‘mule.’ These animals are mentioned 
frequently from the Atharvaveda
	1 onwards. They were known 
not to be fruitful,
	2 and were probably considered inferior to 
horses,

अश्वत्थ
1. Aśva-ttha (‘horse-stand’) is one of India's greatest trees, 
the Ficus religiosa, later called pippala
	1 (now Peepal). Vessels 
made of the wood of the Aśvattha are mentioned in the Rigveda,
	2 
and the tree itself is constantly referred to later.
	3 Its hard 
wood formed the upper of the two pieces of wood used for 
kindling fire, the lower being of Śamī.
	4 It planted its roots in 
shoots of other trees, especially the Khadira, and destroyed 
them;
	5 hence it is called ‘the destroyer’ (vaibādha). Its berries 
are referred to as sweet, and as eaten by birds.
	6 The gods are 
said to sit under it in the third heaven.
	7 It and Nyagrodha 
are styled the ‘crested ones’ (śikhaṇḍin).

अषाढि सौश्रोमतेय
 was a man who is stated in the

अष्टका
अष्टका
 See Māsa.

अष्टकर्णी
अष्ट-कर्णी
 is an expression which occurs in one passage of 
the Ṛigveda,
	1 and which Roth
	2 was at first inclined to interpret 
as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that 
it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The 
exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain. 
Roth
	3 was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced 
ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini
	4 
(bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa). Grassmann's more obvious 
rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’ 
is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on 
the ear’ (karkari-karṇyaḥ), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’ 
(dātra-karṇyaḥ), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ (sthūṇā- 
karṇyaḥ), ‘having the ears bored’ (chidra-karṇyaḥ), and viṣtya- 
karṇyaḥ, given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.
	5 The simple mean
ing, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same 
passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb akṣ occurs in the 
sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the 
Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility. 
The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is 
twice referred to in the Atharvaveda.
	6 The mark is termed 
lakṣman,
	7 and was made with a copper-knife
	8 (lohita). The 
Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā
	9 forbids the use of an arrow-shaft (tejana), 
or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane (ikṣu-kāṇḍa) 
or copper. 1) x. 62, 7. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. 4) vi. 3, 115. 5) iv. 2, 9. 6) vi. 141, 1. 2; xii. 4, 6. 7) Av. vi. 141, 2; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,

असमातिराथप्रौष्ठ
असमाति राथ-प्रौष्ठ
 — The story of the quarrel between 
Asamāti, the Ikṣvāku prince of the Rathaproṣṭha family, and 
his priests, the Gaupāyanas, is found only in the later 
Brāhmaṇas.
	1 It appears to be based on a misreading of the 
Rigveda,
	2 where asamāti is merely an adjective. The later 
story is that the king was induced to abandon his family priests 
by two Asuras, Kirāta and Ākuli, who by their magic com
passed the death of Subandhu, one of the brother priests, and 
that the others revived him by the use of the hymns (Rigveda, 
x. 57-60). 1) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167

असितमृग
असित-मृग
 is the designation in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 
of a family of the Kaśyapas who were excluded from a sacrifice 
by Janamejaya, but who took away the conduct of the offering 
from the Bhūtavīras, whom the king employed. In the 
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 and the Ṣaḍviṃsa Brāhmaṇa
	3 the Asita
mṛgas are called ‘sons of the Kaśyapas,’ and one is mentioned 
as Kusurubindu

 ‘the science of the Asuras,’ the term used in 
the Śāṅkhāyana and Āśvalāyana
	1 Śrauta Sūtras as the equiva
lent of the term māyā employed in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 
clearly means ‘magic,’ as it is rendered by Professor Eggeling.

Śrauta Sūtra, x. 61, 2. 21. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 44,

अस्तृ
अस्तृ,
 ‘shooter,’ is a term frequently used in the Rigveda
	1 
and Atharvaveda
	2 for the archer who fought from the chariot. 1) i. 8, 4; 64, 10; ii. 42, 2, etc. 2) vi. 93, 1. 2; xi. 2, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296.

अहन्
अहन्,
 ‘day.’ Like other peoples, the Indians used night 
as a general expression of time as well as day, but by no means 
predominantly.
	1 Night is also termed the dark (kṛṣṇa), as 
opposed to the light (arjuna), day.
	2 Aho-rātra
	3 is a regular 
term for ‘day and night’ combined. 
The day itself is variously divided. In the Atharvaveda
	4 
a division into ‘the rising sun’ (udyan sūryaḥ), ‘the coming 
together of the cows’ (saṃ-gava), ‘midday’ (madhyaṃ-dina), 
‘afternoon’ (aparāhṇa), and ‘sunset’ (astaṃ-yan) is found. 
In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	5 the same series appears with 
‘early’ (prātar) and ‘evening’ (sāyāhna) substituted for the 
first and last members, while a shorter list gives prātar, 
saṃgava, sāyam. In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	6 there is the 
series ‘dawn’ (uṣas), saṃgava, madhyaṃdina, and aparāhṇa. 
The morning is also, according to Zimmer, called api-śarvara,
	7 
as the time when the dark is just past. It is named svasara,
	8 
as the time when the cows are feeding, before the first milking 
at the saṃgava, or when the birds are awakening.
	9 It is also 
called pra-pitva,
	10 according to Zimmer.
	11 But Geldner
	12 points 
out that that term refers to the late midday, which also is 
called api-śarvara, as bordering on the coming night, being the 
time when day is hastening to its close, as in a race. From 
another point of view, evening is called abhi-pitva,
	13 the time 
when all come to rest. Or again, morning and evening are 
denoted as the dawning of the sun (uditā sūryasya), or its 
setting (ni-mruc). The midday is regularly madhyam ahnām,
	14 
madhye,
	15 or madhyaṃdina. Saṃgava
	16 is the forenoon, between 
the early morning (prātar) and midday (madhyaṃdina). 
The divisions of time less than the day are seldom precisely 
given. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	17 however, a day and 
night make up 30 muhūrtas; 1 muhūrta = 15 kṣipra; 1 kṣipra = 
15 etarhi; 1 etarhi = 15 idāni; 1 idāni = 15 breathings; 1 breath
ing = 1 spiration; 1 spiration = 1 twinkling (nimeṣa), etc. In 
the Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	18 the series is dhvaṃsayo, nimeṣāḥ, 
kāṣṭhāḥ, kalāḥ, kṣanā, muhūrtā, ahorātrāḥ. A thirtyfold division 
of day as well as of night is seen in one passage of the 
Rigveda
	19 by Zimmer, who compares the Babylonian sixty
fold division of the day and night. But the expression used — 
thirty Yojanas — is too vague and obscure — Bergaigne
	20 refers 
it to the firmament — to build any theory upon with safety. 
The longer divisions of time are regularly ‘half month’ 
(ardha-māsa), ‘month’ (māsa), ‘season’ (ṛtu), and ‘year’ 
(saṃvatsara), which often
	21 occur in this sequence after 
ahorātrāṇi (‘days and nights’). 1) Rv. iv. 16, 19; viii. 26, 3; i. 70, 4. Cf. Av. x. 7, 42. 2) Rv. vi. 9. 1. 3) Rv. x. 190, 2; Av. xiii. 3, 8, etc.;

अहल्यामैत्रेयी
अहल्या मैत्रेयी

अहि
अहि
 — This word occurs frequently from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards to denote ‘snake.’ Reference is several times
	2 made 
to its casting its slough. Mention is also made of the serpent's 
peculiar movement,
	3 which earns for it the designation
	4 of 
‘the toothed rope’ (datvatī rajjuḥ). The poisonous character 
of its bite is spoken of,
	5 as well as the torpidity of the reptile 
in winter, when it creeps into the earth.
	6 The cast skin is 
used as an amulet against highwaymen.
	7 Mention is made of 
a mythical horse, Paidva, which the Aśvins gave to Pedu as 
a protection against snakes,
	8 and which is invoked as a 
destroyer of serpents.
	9 The ichneumon (nakula) is regarded 
as their deadly enemy, and as immune against their poison 
through the use of a healing plant,

	5 
as having acquired the secondary sense of ‘thief.’ This is 
denied by Hillebrandt.

आख्यान
आ-ख्यान
 — In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 we hear of the 
Śaunaḥśepa Ākhyāna, ‘the story of Śunaḥśepa,’ which is told 
by the Hotṛ priest at the Rājasūya (‘royal inauguration’). The 
series of stories
	2 used at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 
during the year while the sacrificial horse is allowed to wander 
at its will is called the ‘cyclic’ (pari-plavam). The Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	3 mentions also Ākhyāna-vids (‘men versed in 
tales’), who tell the Sauparṇa legend, elsewhere
	4 known as a 
Vyākhyāna. Yāska, in the Nirukta,
	5 frequently uses the term, 
sometimes in a pregnant sense as denoting the doctrine of the 
Aitihāsikas or traditional interpreters of the Rigveda.

आजातशत्रव
आजात-शत्रव
 See Bhadrasena.

आजि
आजि
 is constantly used in the Rigveda
	1 and the later 
literature to express the sense of ‘a race,’ and only seldom 
denotes ‘a battle.’ Horse-racing was one of the favourite 
amusements of the Vedic Indian,
	2 the other being dicing 
(Akṣa). The racecourse, called Kāṣṭhā
	3 or Āji
	4 itself, appears 
from the Atharvaveda
	5 to have been a quasi-circular one to 
a mark (kārṣman
	6 ) and back again. In the Rigveda the 
course is described as broad (urvī) and the distance as 
measured out (apāvṛktā aratnayaḥ).
	7 Prizes (dhana) were 
offered (dhā),
	8 and eagerly competed for. Other words for 
victory and the prize are kāra
	9 and bhara;
	10 and to ‘run a 
race’ is described by the expressions ājim aj, i, dhāv, sṛ.
	11 
The person who instituted a race is referred to as āji-sṛt,
	12 and 
Indra is called āji-kṛt
	13 (‘race-maker’), and āji-pati
	14 (‘lord 
of the race’). 
The swift steeds (vājin, atya) used for the races were often 
washed and adorned.
	15 According to Pischel
	16 the name of 
one swift mare is preserved — viz., Viśpalā,
	17 whose broken leg 
was replaced by the Aśvins in a race; but the interpretation 
is very doubtful. Geldner
	18 has also found a comic picture of 
a horse-chariot race in the Mudgala hymn in the Rigveda, 
but Bloomfield
	19 has shown that that interpretation is un
sound. Pischel
	20 also seeks to show that races were run in 
honour of gods, but the evidence for the theory is inadequate.
	21 
A formal race, however, is a feature of the ritual of the Rājasūya 
or royal consecration.

80, 8. Zimmer suggests that it may 
mean ‘the course is straight,’ without 
twistings, for which idea cf. Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 2, 160, quoting the 
comparison of the courser's race with 
a bowstring (Rv. iii. 53, 24). It is also 
rendered ‘the barriers are removed.’ 8) Rv. i. 81, 3; 116, 15; vi. 45,

 — This word, which is found in the Rigveda,
	1 but rarely 
later,
	2 appears to be best taken with Roth

denoting the part of the axle of the chariot which is inserted 
into the nave of the wheel. Sāyaṇa renders it as lynch-pin, 
and this sense is accepted by Leumann,
	5 being apparently also 
found in the Nirukta.

word appears by synecdoche to denote the whole chariot, but 
the passage is, according to Geldner,
	8 completely obscure. 1) i. 35, 6; v. 43, 8. 2) In a Mantra in the Aitareya Āraṇ

आथर्वण
आथर्वण,
 a patronymic formed from the name of the 
mythic Atharvan, is found normally in the plural neuter as a 
designation of the hymns of the Atharvans. This use appears 
in the late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda,

Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the singular the expression 
Ātharvaṇa (Veda), though not occurring till the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad,
	3 is earlier than the term ‘Atharvaveda,’ which is 
first found in the Sūtras.

	3 correctly places 
it near the Sarasvatī, either as the small tributary which flows 
past Thānesar or the modern Indramatī farther west, while 
Pischel
	4 assigns it to Kurukṣetra, of which the Āpayā is

the Ambaṣṭhas,’ as interpreted in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 
Later the term Ambaṣṭha denotes ‘a man of mingled Brāhmaṇa 
and Vaiśya parentage by father and mother’ respectively.

आयतन
आ-यतन
 — The general sense of ‘abode’ or ‘home’ appears 
to be limited in one passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 
(vii. 24, 2) to the sense of ‘holy place,’ ‘sanctuary,’ which is 
found in the epic.

आयवस
आयवस
 is mentioned apparently as a king in a corrupt and 
unintelligible verse of the Rigveda.
	1 1) i. 122, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 206; Roth, 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

आयु
आयु
 appears in the Rigveda
	1 with Kutsa and Atithigva as 
having been defeated, with Indra's aid, by Tūrvayāṇa, who is 
believed by Pischel
	2 to have been King of the Pakthas. Possibly 
he is elsewhere
	3 referred to as victorious, by Indra's aid, over 
Veśa. Elsewhere he is quite mythical.

possibly not a proper name. 4) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 100,

आयुत
 See Ghṛta.

आयुध
आ-युध,
 ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole 
of a Kṣatriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 is summed up as horse-chariot (aśva-ratha), bow 
and arrows (iṣu-dhanva), and corselet (kavaca). As the bow and 
arrow (iṣu, dhanvan) were essential as the main weapons of 
the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when Āyudha is 
used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda
	2 
onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda
	3 confirms this 
view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and 
arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour (Varman), with a 
guard (Hastaghna) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the 
bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal, 
but consisted of many pieces fitted together (syūta);
	4 it may 
have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of 
some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior 
wore a helmet (Śiprā). There is no trace of the use of a 
shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of 
greaves or other guard for the feet.
	5 Skill in the use of weapons 
is referred to in the Rigveda.
	6 
It is doubtful whether sling stones (Adri, Aśani) were in 
ordinary use. The hook (aṅkuśa)
	7 also is merely a divine 
weapon, and the axe (svadhiti,
	8 vāśī, paraśu) does not occur in 
mortal combats. For the use of the spear see Ṛṣṭi, Rambhiṇī, 
Śakti, Śaru; of the sword, Asi, Kṛti. Neither weapon can be 
considered ordinary in warfare, nor was the club (Vajra) used. 
For the modes of warfare see Saṃgrāma. 1) vii. 19, 2. 2) i. 39, 2; 61. 13; 92, 1; ii. 30, 9. 
etc.; Av. vi. 133, 2, etc. 3) vi. 75. 4) Rv. i. 31, 15. 5) Grassmann saw greaves in vaṭūriṇā 
padā in Rv. i. 133, 2, but this is most 
improbable. 6) i. 92, 1. Cf. Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 3, 183; Hopkins, Journal of the

आयोगव
आयोगव। — मरुत्त आवि-क्षित,
 the Āyogava king, is men
tioned as a sacrificer in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where also 
a Gāthā (‘stanza’) celebrating his sacrifice is cited. Cf. Ayogū. 1) xiii. 5. 4, 6. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 14-16.

आरङ्गर
आरङ्गर
 is one of the names of the bee found in the 
Rigveda.
	1 Other names are Sarah and Bhṛṅgā. 1) x. 106, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97.

आरा
आरा,
 a word later
	1 known as an ‘awl’ or ‘gimlet,’ occurs in 
the Rigveda
	2 only to designate a weapon of Pūṣan, with whose 
pastoral character its later use for piercing leather is con
sistent. Cf. Vāśī. 1) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 365. n. 1. 2) vi. 53. 8.

आराढि
आराढि
 — Patronymic of Saujāta. Cf. Arāḍa.

आरुणऔपवेशि
आरुण औप-वेशि
 — So the manuscripts let us read the former 
word in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, but this is doubtless an error 
for Aruṇa.

आरुणि
आरुणि
 is the patronymic normally referring to Uddālaka, 
son of Aruṇa Aupaveśi. Uddālaka is probably also meant by 
Āruṇi Yaśasvin, who occurs as a teacher of the Subrahmaṇyā 
(a kind of recitation) in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Āruṇis are 
referred to both in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	2 and in 
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	3 as well as in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
	4 1) ii. 80. 2) ii. 5, 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇ- 
yaka, 204. 3) xiii. 12. 4) ii. 4. 1.

आरुणेय
आरुणेय
 — An epithet of Śvetaketu, indicating his descent 
from Uddālaka Āruṇi and Aruṇa Aupaveśi. It is apparently 
confined to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and Chāndogya Upani
ṣad,
	2 in which Śvetaketu plays a great part. 1) x. 3, 4, 1; xi. 2, 7, 12; 5, 4, 18; 6, 2, 1; xii. 2, 1, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka

 — Patronymic of Śrutarvan and of Āśvamedha.

आर्जीक

	1 and Ārjīkīya
	2 (masc.), Ārjīkīyā
	3 (fem.). — The two 
masculine forms probably denote the people or land, while the 
feminine word designates the river of the land. Hillebrandt
	4 
locates the country in or near Kaśmir, as Arrian
	5 mentions 
Arsaces, brother of Abhisares, who presumably took his name 
from his people, and Abhisāra bordered on Kaśmir. Pischel
	6 
accepts Ārjīka as designating a country, which he, however, 
thinks cannot be identified. But neither Roth
	7 nor Zimmer
	8 
recognizes the word as a proper name. On the other hand, 
all authorities agree in regarding Ārjīkīyā as the name of a 
river. Roth
	9 does so in one passage
	10 only, elsewhere seeing 
references to Soma vessels; but it seems necessary to treat the 
word alike in all passages containing it. Zimmer does not 
locate the river, and Pischel denies the possibility of its 
identification. Hillebrandt thinks it may have been the 
Upper Indus, or the Vitastā (the Jhelum), or some other 
stream. Grassmann follows Yāska
	11 in identifying it with the 
the Vipāś (Beäs), but this is rendered improbable by the 
position of the name in the hymn in praise of rivers (nadī- 
stuti).
	12 Brunnhofer
	13 identifies it with the Arghesan, a tributary 
of the Arghanab. 1) Singular: Rv. viii. 7, 29; ix. 113, 2.

आर्तव
आर्तव
 — This expression denotes a portion of the year 
consisting of more seasons than one. But it does not bear the 
exact sense of ‘half-year,’ as suggested by Zimmer.
	1 This is 
shown by the fact that it occurs regularly in the plural, not in 
the dual. In the Atharvaveda it occurs between seasons and 
years (hāyana),
	2 but also in the combinations, ‘seasons, Ārtavas, 
months, years,;
	3 ‘half-months, months, Ārtavas, seasons’;
	4 
‘seasons, Ārtavas, months, half-months, days and nights, day’;
	5

year,’

cited in this sense in the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, is not so to be understood, 
as the word there is merely adjectival.

आर्त्नी
आर्त्नी
 denotes the end of the bow to which the bow-string 
(jyā) was attached.
	1 The string was not normally kept 
fastened to both ends of the bow, but when an arrow was to 
be shot it was strung taut.
	2 On the other hand, the legend 
of the death of Viṣṇu, told in the later Saṃhitās
	3 and 
Brāhmaṇas,
	4 expressly contemplates his leaning on his strung 
bow, which cleaves his head by the sudden springing apart 
of the two ends when the bow-string is gnawed through. 1) Rv. vi. 75, 4; Av. i. 1, 3; Maitrā

आर्य
आर्य
 is the normal designation in the Vedic literature from 
the Rigveda
	1 onwards of an Āryan, a member of the three 
upper classes, Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, or Vaiśya, as the formal 
division is given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 The Ārya 
stands in opposition to the Dāsa,
	3 but also to the Śūdra. 
Sometimes
	4 the expression is restricted to the Vaiśya caste, 
the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya receiving special designations; 
but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also 
whether Arya is not meant. The phrase Śūdrāryau
	5 is espe
cially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the 
Śūdra and the Āryan, for in the Mahāvrata ceremony the fight 
between a Śūdra and an Ārya is represented in the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa as one between a Brāhmaṇa and a Śūdra, though 
the Sūtra treats it as a fight between a Vaiśya and a Śūdra. 
The word Ārya (fem. Āryā or Ārī) also occurs frequently 
used as an adjective to describe the Āryan classes (viśaḥ),
	6 or 
name (nāman),
	7 or caste (varṇa),
	8 or dwellings (dhāman);
	9 or 
again reference is made to the Āryan supremacy (vrata)
	10 being 
extended over the land. Āryan foes (vṛtra)
	11 are referred to 
beside Dāsa foes, and there are many
	12 references to war 
of Āryan versus Āryan, as well as to war of Āryan against 
Dāsa. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the 
time of the Rigveda the Āryan communities had advanced 
far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In 
the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas the wars alluded to seem 
mainly Āryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of 
Ārya and Dāsa into one community. 
Weber
	13 considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda 
were the Āryans and the four peoples of the quarters (diś) 
of the earth, but this is doubtful. Āryan speech (vāc)
	14 
is specially referred to in the Aitareya and Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyakas. 1) Rv. i. 51, 8; 130, 8; 156, 5, etc. 2) iv. 1, 6 (Kāṇva recension). 3) Rv. i. 51, 8. 9; 103, 3; vi. 20, 10; 
25, 2, 3, etc. (opposed to Dāsa); Av. 
iv. 20, 4. 8; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 
6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 30, etc. 
(opposed to Sūdra). 4) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 205, 215, 
finds this use — understanding Ārya as 
meant — in Atharvaveda, xix. 32, 8, and 
62, 1, as well as in passages where 
Śūdrāryau is found. Lanman, in 
Whitney's Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 948, 1003, quotes his view with 
approval; but Whitney's version leaves 
no doubt that he read and understood 
the text as Ārya, the Āryan, not the 
Vaiśya. For Whitney's view, Av. iv. 20, 
4. 8 may be cited; and so Roth, St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., takes the 
passages. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 
10, 8, Śūdrāryau must mean Sūdra and 
Vaiśya; but the Padapāṭha takes it as 
Arya, and so does Zimmer. 5) See Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 9, 3, 
with Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 3, 
7. 8; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 17; Tait

 — Patronymic of Devāpi.
	1 1) Rv. x. 98, 5. 6. 8; Nirukta, ii. 11; Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 155.

आल
आल
 appears to mean ‘weed’ in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and to 
form part of three other words,
	2 denoting, according to Sāyaṇa, 
grass-creepers (sasya-vallī) — viz., Alasālā, Silañjālā,
	3 and Nīlā
galasāla. Whitney,
	4 however, does not think that the words 
can be given any determinate sense. 1) Av. vi. 16, 3. But Whitney takes 
the word as a verb, comparing v. 
22, 6. 2) Av. vi. 16, 4. 3) Sāyaṇa reads Śalāñjālā, and the 
manuscripts of the Kauśika Sūtra 
(vi. 16), have Śilāñjālā. But cf. Silācī. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
292, 293. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of 
the Atharvaveda, 466.

आलम्बायनीपुत्र
आलम्बायनी-पुत्र
 is mentioned in a Vaṃśa or Genealogy 
of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 
(vi. 5, 2) as a pupil of Ālambī-putra. In the Mādhyandina 
recension (vi. 4, 32) the relation is reversed, for there he is 
teacher of Ālambī-putra and pupil of Jāyantī-putra.

आलम्बीपुत्र
आलम्बी-पुत्र
 is a pupil of Jāyantī-putra according to a 
Vaṃśa in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 
(vi. 5, 2), but of Ālambāyanī-putra according to the Mādhy
andina (vi. 4, 32).

आलिगी
आलिगी
 is the name of a kind of serpent in the Atharvaveda 
(v. 13, 7). Cf. Viligī.

आवसथ
आ-वसथ
 (‘dwelling’). — The precise sense
	1 of this term 
appears to be a place for the reception of guests, especially 
Brāhmaṇas and others on the occasion of feasts and sacrifices 
(somewhat like the modern meaning of Dharma-śālā as a rest
house for pilgrims), a use derived from the more general sense 
of ‘abode.’
	2 1) Av. ix. 6, 5 (a hymn in praise of 
entertaining Brāhmaṇas); Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 6; iii. 7, 4, 6; 
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 4, 6 
(where Eggeling renders the word as if 
meaning ‘house’ merely); Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 1, etc. Details are 
given in the Sūtras — e.g., Āpastamba 
Śrauta Sūtra, v. 9, 3; Dharma Sūtra, 
ii. 9, 25, 4. 2) E.g., Aitareya Upaniṣad, iii. 12. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 
120, n. 1.

आविक
आविक
 (‘coming from the sheep,’ avi) is a term for ‘wool,’ 
which occurs first in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 3, 6). 
Cf. Avi.

अविक्षित
अवि-क्षित
 — Patronymic of Marutta,
	1 the Āyogava. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 6.

आशरीक
आ-शरीक
 appears to denote a disease in a hymn of the 
Atharvaveda
	1 celebrating the powers of the Jaṅgida plant. 
Zimmer
	2 thinks that it merely denotes the pain in the limbs 
accompanying fever. Whitney
	3 suggests taking the word as 
merely an epithet. 1) xix. 34, 10. 2) Altindisches Leben, 65, 391. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
953. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 673.

आशिर्
आ-शिर्
 (‘admixture’) denotes the mixing, and more especially 
the milk mixed with the juice, of the Soma before it was 
offered to the gods. In this sense it is not rare from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards. Not milk alone was employed for this 
purpose. The epithet ‘having three admixtures’ applied to 
Soma
	2 is explained by the other epithets, ‘mixed with milk’ 
(gavāśir), ‘mixed with curds’ (dadhy-āśir), and ‘mixed with 
grain’ (yavāśir) — all referring to Soma. 1) i. 134, 6; iii. 53, 14; viii. 2, 10. 
11, etc.; Av. ii. 29, 1, etc.; Nirukta, 
vi. 8; 32. 2) Rv. v. 27, 5; cf. viii. 2, 7. Cf. 
Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 209 
et seq.

आशीविष
आशी-विष,
 occurring only in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 is 
understood by Roth
	2 as designating a particular kind of snake, 
and perhaps means ‘having poison (viṣa) in its fangs’ (āśī). 1) vi. 1. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It 
is a common word in the Epic and 
later.

आशु
आशु,
 the ‘swift,’ is frequently used without Aśva to denote 
the chariot steed from the Rigveda
	1 onwards. 1) ii. 16, 3; 31, 2; 38, 3, etc.; Av. ii. 
14, 6; iv. 27, 1; xiii. 2, 2; Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, i. 8, 10; Satapatha Brāh
maṇa, v. 3, 3, 3, etc.

आशुंग
आशुं-ग
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 seems to denote some sort of 
animal. It is qualified by the word ‘young’ (śiśuka), and 
Roth
	2 suggests that it may mean a bird (‘swift-flying’), or 
that the expression denotes ‘a foal going to its dam’ (āśu-ga). 
Sāyaṇa, however, reads the accompanying word as śuśuka, 
which he assumes to denote an animal. Bloomfield
	3 renders 
the two words ‘a swift (āśuṃga) foal (śiśuka),’ thus agreeing 
with one of Roth's suggestions in sense, though not in the 
explanation of Aśuṃga. 1) vi. 14, 3. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. 
Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 291.

आश्रम
आ-श्रम
 (‘resting-place’) does not occur in any Upaniṣad 
which can be regarded as pre-Buddhistic. Its earliest use as 
denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the Śvetāśvatara 
Upaniṣad.
	1 In one passage
	2 of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 
reference is made only to the Brahmacārin and householder, to 
whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the 
practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures, 
and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In 
another place
	3 three states are contemplated, but not as con
secutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder 
or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his 
life. Similarly, reference
	4 is made to the death of the anchorite 
in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all 
three
	5 is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahma
saṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	6 the knower of the 
Ātman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice 
and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place
	7 with 
those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who 
practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and 
distinction from, the Āśramas became later a fourth

the Gṛhastha, or householder, who was in the second stage, 
being required to pass not only into the stage of Vānaprastha, 
but also that of the Sannyāsin (Bhikṣu, Parivrājaka). The 
first stage, that of the Brahmacārin, was still obligatory, but 
was no longer allowed to remain a permanent one, as was 
originally possible.

आश्वघ्न
आश्व-घ्न
 — This name occurs in one passage of the Rig
veda,
	1 in a very obscure hymn, where it appears to denote a 
prince who had made offerings to Indra, and who may, as 
Ludwig
	2 thinks, have been called Vitaraṇa. 1) x. 61, 21. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165.

अश्वतरआश्वि
अश्वतर आश्वि,
 or Āśvatarāśvi. — These two expressions are 
used
	1 as patronymics of Buḍila, denoting, according to Sāyaṇa,
	2 
that he was son of Aśva, and descendant of Aśvatara. 1) The first is found in Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, vi. 30; the second in Sata
patha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 1, 9; x. 6, 1, 1; 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 15, 8; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 1; 16, 1. 2) On Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.

अश्वत्थ्य
अश्व-त्थ्य
 — Patronymic of Ahīnā.
	1 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 9, 10. Possibly to be read Āśvathya.

अश्वमेध
अश्व-मेध
 is the patronymic of an unnamed prince, who 
occurs in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda (viii. 68, 
15. 16).

आश्ववाल
आश्व-वाल
 — From this adjective (‘made of horse-tail grass’), 
applied to a strew (prastara) in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 
1, 17; 6, 3, 10), follows the existence of the Aśvavāla grass 
(Saccharum spontaneum).

आश्वसूक्ति
आश्व-सूक्ति
 is mentioned in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xix. 4, 2, 
et seq.) as an author of Sāmans (Soma chants) along with 
Gausūkti.

आश्विन
आश्विन,
 or Āśvīna, designates, in the Atharvaveda
	1 and two 
Brāhmaṇas,
	2 the length of journey made in a day by a horseman 
(aśvin). The exact distance is not defined. In the Atharva it 
appears to exceed five leagues, being mentioned immediately 
after a distance of three or five Yojanas; in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa the heavenly world is placed at a distance of a 
thousand Āśvinas. 1) vi. 131, 3. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17; Pañ
caviṃśa Brāhmaṇa in Indische Studien, 
1, 34.

आषाधिसौश्रोमतेय
आषाधि सौश्रोमतेय
 — According to the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	1 he was ruined because the heads were put on at the 
Agniciti in a certain manner, and not correctly. 1) vi. 2, 1, 37. Eggeling has Aṣāḍhi, but as it is a patronymic of Aṣāḍha, the 
form Āṣāḍhi seems correct.

आष्ट्रा
आष्ट्रा
 seems in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxxvii. 1) to denote 
the ploughman's goad.

आष्ट्री
आष्ट्री
 — In the Rigveda
	1 the word seems to denote a fire
place. The evil bird is entreated not to settle there on the 
hearth. 1) x. 165, 3. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 347.

आसङ्गप्लायोगि
आसङ्ग प्लायोगि
 is a king who appears in a Dānastuti 
(‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda
	1 as a generous patron. 
Owing, however, to the addition of a curious phallic verse to 
the hymn, and its early misunderstanding,
	2 a legend was 
invented that he lost his manhood and became a woman, but 
by the intercession of Medhyātithi was transformed into a man, 
much to the delight of his wife, Śaśvatī, whose existence is 
based on a misunderstanding of the phrase ‘every woman’ 
(śaśvatī nārī) in the added verse.
	3 Another misunderstanding 
of the Dānastuti
	4 gives him a son Svanad-ratha, really a mere 
epithet, and makes him a descendant of Yadu. 1) viii. 1, 32. 33. 2) viii. 1, 34. See Hopkins, Religions 
of India, 150, n. 1; Bṛhaddevatā, ii. 83; 
vi. 41, with Macdonell's notes. Dyā
dviveda gives the tale at length in Vedic 
words taken from the Nighaṇṭu, a 
curious jeu d'esprit. See the extract 
from the Nītimañjarī given by Sieg, 
Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 40, 41. 3) viii. 1, 34. 4) viii. 1, 31. 32. Cf. Ludwig, Trans

आसन्दी
आ-सन्दी
 — This is a generic term for a seat of some sort, 
occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and Brāhmaṇas.
	2 
but not in the Rigveda. In the Atharvaveda
	3 the settle brought 
for the Vrātya is described at length. It had two feet, lengths 
wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it 
was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with 
a cushion (Āstaraṇa) and a pillow (Upabarhaṇa), had a seat 
(Āsāda) and a support (Upaśraya). Similar seats are described 
in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	4 and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa.
	5 
The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in 
very similar terms in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	6 where the 
height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and 
cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part 
(vivayana) is to be of Muñja grass, and the seat of Udumbara 
wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda
	7 Lanman 
seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There 
also a cushion (Upadhāna) and coverlet (Upavāsana) are 
mentioned. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly describes 
the Āsandī in terms showing that it was an elaborate seat. In 
one place
	8 it is said to be made of Khadira wood, perforated 
(vi-tṛṇṇā), and joined with straps (vardhra-yutā) like that of the 
Bhāratas. At the Sautrāmaṇī rite
	9 (an Indra sacrifice) the 
seat is of Udumbara wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited 
width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The 
imperial seat
	10 is to be shoulder-high, of Udumbara wood, and 
wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass (Eleusina indica). 
Elsewhere
	11 the seat is a span high, a cubit in width and 
depth, of Udumbara wood, and covered with reed-grass cords, 
and daubed with clay. 1) Av. xiv. 2, 65; xv. 3, 2 et seq.;

आसन्दीवत्|आसन्दीवन्त्
आसन्दी-वन्त्,
 ‘possessing the throne,’ is the title of the royal 
city of Janamejaya Pārikṣita, in which the horse, for his famous 
Aśvamedha, was bound. The authorities both cite a Gāthā for 
the fact, but they differ as to the priest who celebrated the rite. 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 he is stated to have been Indrota 
Daivāpa Śaunaka, but in the Aitareya
	2 Tura Kāvaṣeya. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 2. 2) viii. 21. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, xvi. 9, 1. Pāṇini, viii. 2, 12, 
knows the name.

आसाद
आ-साद,
 ‘seat,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda
	1 as a description 
of part of the settle (Āsandī) of the Vrātya. It seems best to 
regard it with Whitney
	2 as the seat proper; Aufrecht,
	3 
Zimmer,
	4 and Roth
	5 render it as the ‘cushion for the seat,’ but 
that is sufficiently described by the word Āstaraṇa. 1) xv. 3, 8. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
771. 3) Indische Studien, 1, 131. 4) Altindisches Leben, 155. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

आसुरायण
आसुरायण
 is mentioned as a pupil of Traivaṇi in the first 
two Vaṃśas
	1 (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 
in both recensions, but as a pupil of Āsuri in the third Vaṃśa.

आसुरि
 occurs in the first two Vaṃśas
	1 (lists of teachers) of 
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad as a pupil of Bhāradvāja and 
teacher of Aupajandhani, but in the third
	2 as a pupil of 
Yājñavalkya and teacher of Āsurāyaṇa. He appears as a 
ritual authority in the first four books of the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	3 and as an authority on dogmatic, specially noted for his 
insistence on truth, in the last book.

of this teacher and the founder of the 
Sāṃkhya system is not, however, ac
ceptable. See Garbe, Sāṃkhya Philo- 
sophie, 29, 30.

आसुरिवासिन्
आसुरि-वासिन्
 is a name of Prāśnī-putra in a Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2, in both 
recensions).

आसेचन
आ-सेचन
 designates a vessel to hold liquids, such as meat 
juice (yūṣan)
	1 or ghee.
	2 Of its shape and make we know 
nothing. 1) Rv. i. 162, 13. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 9, 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271.

आस्तरण
आ-स्तरण
 denotes the coverlet of the settle (Āsandī) of the 
Vrātya.
	1 A tiger's skin serves as the coverlet of the king's 
seat in the royal consecration (Rājasūya).
	2 In the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad
	3 the word used is Upastaraṇa. 1) Av. xv. 3, 7. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5. 3) i. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
155.

आस्त्रबुध्न
आस्त्र-बुध्न
 is the name of a man whom Indra is said in the 
Rigveda
	1 to have assisted. It is not clear whether Venya, who 
is mentioned in the same line, was his friend
	2 or his enemy,
	3 
whom Indra saved or defeated for him. 1) x. 171, 3. 2) So Grassmann and Griffith in their 
translations. 3) So Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 167.

आस्थातृ
आ-स्थातृ
 — The warrior in the chariot is once thus desig
nated (as ‘standing on the car’) in the Rigveda.
	1 Normally he 
is named Rathin or Ratheṣṭhā. 1) vi. 47, 26. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296.

आस्राव
आ-स्राव
 (‘discharge’) denotes a disease, thrice referred to in 
the Atharvaveda,
	1 the precise nature of which is uncertain. 
The Scholiast
	2 in one place interprets it as painful urination 
(mūtrātisāra), while Lanman
	3 suggests diabetes. Bloomfield
	4 
takes it to be diarrhœa, and Zimmer
	5 argues that as the remedy 
is called ‘wound healer’ (arus-srāṇa), the sense is ‘the flux from 
unhealed wounds.’ Whitney
	6 renders it ‘flux,’ and questions 
Bloomfield's rendering. Ludwig
	7 translates it vaguely by ‘sick
ness’ and ‘cold.’ 1) i. 2, 4; ii. 3, 2; vi. 44, 2. 2) On Av. i. 2, 4. Cf. on ii. 3, 2. 3) In Whitney's Translation of the

आहनस्या
आहनस्या
 (‘unchaste’). — This word in the plural (‘lascivious 
verses’) denotes a section (xx. 136) of the Kuntāpa hymns of 
the Atharvaveda, which are of an obscene character.
	1 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 36; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 7. Cf. Bloomfield, 
Atharvaveda, 99.

आहाव
आ-हाव
 denotes a pail or bucket, especially in conjunction 
with a well (Avata).

आह्नेय
आह्नेय
 — Patronymic of Sauca (Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 12).

इक्षु
इक्षु,
 the generic name for the sugar-cane, is first found in 
the Atharvaveda
	1 and the later Saṃhitās.
	2 Whether it grew 
wild, or was cultivated, does not appear from the references. 1) i. 34, 5. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 7, 9; iv. 2, 
9 (ikṣu-kāṇḍa). In Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxv. 1; Taittirīya Saṃhiṭā, vii. 3, 16, 1; 
Kāṭhaka Aśvamedha, in. 8, ‘eyelash’ 
is meant. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 72; Roth, St. Petersburg Dic
tionary, s.v.

इक्ष्वाकु
इक्ष्वाकु
 — In the Rigveda this name occurs but once,
	1 and in 
a doubtful context. It is clear, however, that it denotes a 
prince; later interpretations make Asamāti, whose name is read 
into the hymn, an Ikṣvāku prince.
	2 In the Atharvaveda
	3 also 
the name is found in only one passage, where it is uncertain 
whether a descendant of Ikṣvāku, or Ikṣvāku himself, is referred 
to; in either case he seems to be regarded as an ancient hero. 
In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	4 mention is made of Tryaruṇa 
Traidhātva Aikṣvāka, who is identical with the Tryaruṇa 
Traivṛṣṇa of the Bṛhaddevatā,
	5 and with Tryaruṇa Trasa- 
dasyu in the Rigveda.
	6 The connection of Trasadasyu with 
the Ikṣvākus is confirmed by the fact that Purukutsa was an 
Aikṣvāka, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	7 Thus the 
Ikṣvāku line was originally a line of princes of the Pūrus. 
Zimmer
	8 places them on the upper Indus, but they may well 
have been somewhat further east.
	9 Later Ikṣvāku is connected 
with Ayodhyā 1) x. 60, 4. 2) Cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167;

इट
1. Iṭa. — This word occurs twice in the Atharvaveda. in 
the first passage
	1 it seems to denote a bulrush of the sort that 
dies in a year; in the second
	2 it refers to the reed work of the 
house. 1) vi. 14, 3. Cf. iv. 19, 1; Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464. 2) ix. 3, 18. Cf. Pischel, Zeitschrift 
der Deutschen Morgenlāndischen Gesell- 
schaft, 35, 718.

इट
2. Iṭa appears as a Ṛṣi and a protégé of Indra in one hymn 
of the Rigveda.
	1 Roth,
	2 however, thinks that the word is 
really part of a verb (iṭ) meaning ‘to err, wander’ (cp. aṭ), and 
that the name is a mere misunderstanding. It is already 
so regarded in the Anukramaṇī, but not apparently in the 
Bṛhaddevatā.

इटन्त्काव्य
इटन्त् काव्य
 is the name of a sage, contemporary with 
Keśin Dārbhya, in the Kauṣitaki Brāhmaṇa.
	1 He is also 
mentioned as Iḍhant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	2 1) vii. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 293; 2, 308. 2) xiv. 9, 16.

इतिहास
इतिहास,
 as a kind of literature, is repeatedly mentioned 
along with Purāṇa in the later texts of the Vedic period. 
The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book 
of the Atharvaveda.
	1 Itihāsa then appears in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 the Jaiminīya,
	3 Bṛhadāraṇyaka,
	4 and Chāndogya 
Upaniṣads.
	5 In the latter it is expressly declared with Purāṇa 
to make up the fifth Veda, while the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	6 
makes the Itihāsa a Veda and the Purāṇa a Veda. The 
Itihāsa-veda and the Purāṇa-veda appear also in the Gopatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	7 while the Śatapatha
	8 identifies the Itihāsa as well 
as the Purāṇa with the Veda. In one passage Anvākhyāna 
and Itihāsa are distinguished
	9 as different classes of works, but 
the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former 
was supplementary. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	10 mentions 
Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural. 
There is nothing to show in the older literature what dis
tinction there was, if any, between Itihāsa and Purāṇa; and 
the late literature,
	11 which has been elaborately examined by 
Sieg,
	12 yields no consistent result. Geldner
	13 has conjectured 
that there existed a single work, the Itihāsa-purāṇa, a collection 
of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical; 
but though a work called Itihāsa, and another called Purāṇa, 
were probably known to Patañjali,
	14 the inaccuracy of Geldner's 
view is proved by the fact that Yāska shows no sign of having 
known any such work. To him the Itihāsa may be a part of 
the Mantra literature itself,
	15 Aitihāsikas being merely people 
who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others 
see myths.
	16 The fact, however, that the use of the compound 
form is rare, and that Yāska regularly has Itihāsa,
	17 not 
Itihāsa-purāṇa, is against the theory of there ever having been 
one work. 
The relation of Itihāsa to Ākhyāna is also uncertain. Sieg
	18 
considers that the words Itihāsa and Purāṇa referred to the 
great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic 
legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a 
fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus, 
Anvākhyānas, Anuvyākhyānas, and Vyākhyānas could arise, 
and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle, 
while an Ākhyāna could also be a part of the Itihāsa-purāṇa. 
He also suggests that the word Ākhyāna has special reference 
to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg,
	19 following Windisch,
	20 
and followed by Geldner,
	21 Sieg, and others, has found in the 
Ākhyāna form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as 
the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of 
the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form 
was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the 
emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel
	22 
and von Schroeder.
	23 These scholars, in accordance with 
older suggestions of Max Müller
	24 and Lévi,
	25 see in the 
so-called Ākhyāna hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg 
finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though 
the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas. 
Elsewhere
	26 it has been suggested that the hymns in question 
are merely literary dialogues. 1) xv. 6, 4 et seq. 2) xiii. 4, 3, 12. 13, and as com

इन्द्रगोप
इन्द्र-गोप
 (‘protected by Indra’), masc., is a designation 
of the cochineal insect in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 
(ii. 3, 6).

इन्द्रद्युम्नभाल्लवेयवैयाघ्रपद्य
इन्द्र-द्युम्न भाल्लवेय वैयाघ्र-पद्य
 is mentioned 
as a teacher who with others was unable to agree as to the 
nature of Agni Vaiśvānara, and who was instructed by 
Aśvapati Kaikeya.
	1 As Bhāllaveya he is cited several times 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 on ritual points. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 
1 et seq.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11,

इन्द्रभूकाश्यप
इन्द्र-भू काश्यप
 is mentioned as a pupil of Mitrabhū 
Kāśyapa in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

इन्द्रोत
1. Indrota is twice mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 in a Dānastuti 
(‘Praise of Liberality’) as a giver of gifts. In the second passage 
he has the epithet Ātithigva, which shows conclusively that he 
was a son of Atithigva, as Ludwig
	2 holds, and not of Ṛkṣa, as 
Roth
	3 states. 1) viii. 68, 10 et seq. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

इन्द्रोतदैवापशौनक
2. Indrota Daivāpa Śaunaka is mentioned in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the priest who officiated at the horse 
sacrifice of Janamejaya, although this honour is attributed in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	2 to Tura Kāvaṣeya. He also appears 
in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	3 as a pupil of Śruta, 
and is mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	4 He cannot be 
connected in any way with Devāpi, who occurs in the 
Rigveda.

इभ
1. Ibha is a word of somewhat doubtful sense and inter
pretation. It is found only in the Saṃhitās,
	1 and especially in 
the Rigveda.
	2 According to Roth
	3 and Ludwig
	4 the sense is 
‘retainer,’ and Zimmer
	5 thinks that it includes not only 
dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the 
youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel 
and Geldner
	6 it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported 
by the authority of the commentators Sāyaṇa
	7 and Mahīdhara;
	8 
the Nirukta,
	9 too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the 
word. Megasthenes
	10 and Nearchos
	11 tell us that elephants 
were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word Ibhya may 
thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit., 
‘possessor of elephants’).
	12 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 2, 14, 1; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 9. 2) i. 84, 17; iv. 4, 1; ix. 57, 3, and 
perhaps vi. 20, 8. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 246,

‘retainer,’ and in Aśoka's Edicts, No. 5, 
Bühler, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 37, 279, finds a 
Vaiśya denoted by its Pāli form. 10) Apud Strabo, 704. 11) Ibid., 705. 12) But it may equally well be ex
plained as ‘rich’ from the other sense 
of the primary word: ‘possessor of 
(many) retainers.’

इभ
2. Ibha in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 appears certainly to 
be intended as an abbreviation of the proper name Smadibha. 1) vi. 20, 8. Cf. Pischel and Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 1, xvi; Roth, St. Peters
burg Dictionary, s.v.; Oldenberg, 
Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 380. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 167, treats it as ‘retinue,’ 
as does Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 246, 247.

इभ्य
इभ्य
 occurs once in the Rigveda
	1 in the plural, when a king 
is said to devour his Ibhyas as the fire the forest; and twice 
in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	2 in one passage as the first 
member of a compound, and in the other as either a proper 
name or an adjective. Roth,
	3 Ludwig,
	4 and Zimmer
	5 interpret 
the word as ‘retainers’ in the Rigveda, but in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad Roth thinks it means ‘rich.’ Pischel and Geldner
	6 
accept the sense in all passages. Böhtlingk in his trans
lation of the Chāndogya treats the word as simply a proper 
name, ‘Ibhya's village’ (ibhya-grāma) and ‘Ibhya.’ 1) i. 65, 4. 2) i. 10, 1. 2. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Translation of the Rigveda 3,

Grammatical Index, 35.

इरिण
इरिण
 (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and 
Brāhmaṇas
	2 in the sense of ‘a cleft in the ground,’ usually 
natural (sva-kṛta). The same meaning is also, as Pischel
	3 
shows, to be ascribed to it in three passages of the Rigveda,
	4 
in one
	5 of which the hole is referred to as ‘made by water’ 
(apā kṛtam). In another passage of the Rigveda
	6 the word 
refers to the place on which the dice are thrown. Hence 
Pischel
	7 concludes that the dicing-board must have been 
so called because it contained holes into which the dice had 
to be thrown if possible. Lüders,
	8 however, points out that 
this assumption is not necessary; the dice (Akṣa) were merely 
thrown on a space dug out, which could be called Iriṇa, as 
being a hole in the ground, though not a natural one. This 
view is supported by the commentary of Sāyaṇa,
	9 as well as 
by Durga in his note on the Nirukta.

इषश्यावाश्वि
इष श्यावाश्वि
 is mentioned in a Vaṃśa (‘list of teachers’) of 
the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 16, 1) as a pupil of 
Agastya.

इषीका
इषीका,
 ‘a stalk of reed grass,’ occurs frequently from the 
Atharvaveda
	1 onwards, often as an emblem of fragility. In 
the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	2 it seems to denote the pin fixed in 
the bar of a pen to keep cattle in (argaleṣīke, ‘bolt and pin’). 
A basket (śūrpa) of Iṣīkā is referred to in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.

इषु
इषु
 is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards. Other names are Śarya, Śārī, and Bāṇa. In the 
hymn of the Rigveda,
	2 which gives a catalogue of armour, 
two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is 
poisoned (ālāktā), and has a head of horn (ruru-śīrṣṇī); the 
other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed (ayo-mukham). Poisoned 
(digdhā) arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda.
	3 The 
arrows were feathered.
	4 The parts of an arrow are enumerated 
in the Atharvaveda
	5 as the shaft (śalya), the feather-socket 
(parṇa-dhi), the point (śṛṅga), the neck of the point in which 
the shaft is fixed (kulmala), and the Apaskambha and Apāṣṭha, 
which are of more doubtful significance. In the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	6 the parts of an arrow are given as the point (anīka), 
the śalya, tejana, and the feathers (parṇāni), where śalya and 
tejana must apparently mean the upper and lower parts of the 
shaft, since it is reasonable to suppose that the arrow is 
described as a whole consecutively. So in the Atharvaveda
	7 
the arrow of Kāma is described as having feathers, a shaft 
(śalya), and a firm fastening (kulmala).
	8 The arrow was shot 
from the ear, and so is described in the Rigveda
	9 as ‘having 
the ear for its place of birth.’ 
As a measure of length, the Iṣu was five spans, say three feet.
	10 
A regular profession of arrow-making existed (iṣu-kṛt,
	11 iṣu-kāra).

इषुत्रिकाण्डा
इषु त्रि-काण्डा
 is the name given in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 
to some constellation, perhaps Orion's girdle. It is mentioned 
with Mṛga, Mṛgavyādha, and Rohiṇī. 1) iii. 33. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 205, n.

इषुधि
इषु-धि
 (‘arrow-holder’) is the name of the quiver which was 
carried by every bowman. The word is common from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards. No trace is to be found in Vedic literature 
of the later practice of carrying two quivers.
	2 According to 
Pischel,
	3 the curious expression iṣu-kṛt in the Rigveda
	4 means 
quiver. 1) i. 33, 3; vi. 75, 5; x. 95, 3; Av. 
ii. 33, 2; iv. 10, 6, etc.; Nirukta, ix. 13. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American

Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 182. 4) i. 184, 3. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben,

ईषा
ईषा
 denotes the ‘pole of a chariot.’ Normally the chariot had 
one pole (ekeṣaḥ),
	1 but sometimes two poles are referred to.
	2 
The word is often
	3 compounded with Yuga, ‘yoke,’ into which 
it was fastened (see Kha), and tied with ropes.
	4 Exactly how it 
was attached to the chariot we do not know.
	5 See also Ratha. 1) Rv. x. 135, 3; iii. 53, 17; viii. 5,

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249, to refer 
to the front part of the chariot, but it 
seems simply to be ‘voice.’

उक्षण्यायन

 is mentioned in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) 
in the Rigveda
	1 along with Harayāṇa and Suṣāman. Ludwig

उग्र
उग्र
 in one passage of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	1 seems 
to have a technical force, denoting ‘man in authority,’ or 
according to Max Müller's rendering, ‘policeman.’ Roth
	2 
compares a passage in the Rigveda,
	3 where, however, the word 
has simply the general sense of ‘mighty man.’ Böhtlingk,
	4 in 
his rendering of the Upaniṣad, treats the word as merely 
adjectival. 1) iv. 3, 37. 38. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) vii. 38, 6. 4) P. 66 (with pratyenasaḥ).

उग्रदेव
उग्र-देव
 is mentioned with Turvaśa and Yadu in the 
Rigveda
	1 apparently as a powerful protector. The name occurs 
also in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,
	3 
where he is styled Rājani and called a leper (kilāsa). 1) i. 36, 18 (Ugrādeva). 2) xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11. 3) v. 4, 12. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 147; Roth, St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v., who suggests that in 
the Rv. passage the word should be 
taken adjectivally.

उग्रसेन
उग्र-सेन
 is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 
4, 3), and in a Gāthā there cited as being, with Bhīmasena and 
Śrutasena, a Pārikṣitīya and a brother of Janamejaya. The 
brothers were cleansed by the horse sacrifice from sin.

उच्चैःश्रवस्कौपयेय
उच्चैः-श्रवस् कौपयेय
 appears in the Jaiminīya Upani
ṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 29, 1-3) as a king of the Kurus and as 
maternal uncle of Keśin. His connexion with the Kurus is 
borne out by the fact that Upamaśravas was son of Kuru- 
śravaṇa, the names being strikingly similar.

उच्छीर्षक
उच्-छीर्षक
 — This word, occurring in the description of the 
couch (paryaṅka) in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	1 (i. 5), apparently 
denotes a cushion for the head. See also Āsandī. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 403; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 155.

उत्तरकुरु
उत्तर कुरु
 — The Uttara Kurus, who play a mythical part 
in the Epic and later literature, are still a historical people in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where they are located beyond the 
Himālaya (pareṇa Himavantam). In another passage,
	2 how
ever, the country of the Uttara Kurus is stated by Vāsiṣṭha 
Sātyahavya to be a land of the gods (deva-kṣetra), but Jānaṃ- 
tapi Atyarāti was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not 
wholly mythical. It is reasonable to accept Zimmer's view 
that the northern Kurus were settled in Kaśmīr, especially as 
Kurukṣetra is the region where tribes advancing from Kaśmīr 
might naturally be found. Cf. Udīcyas. 1) viii. 14. 2) viii. 23.

उत्तरमद्र
उत्तर मद्र
 is the name of a tribe mentioned with the 
Uttara Kurus in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 as living beyond the 
Himālaya. Zimmer
	2 points out that in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	3 
Kāmboja Aupamanyava is a pupil of Madragāra, and thence 
infers that Kambojas and Madras were not far distant in space. 
This conclusion is perfectly reasonable in view of the probable 
position of the Kāmbojas.

उत्तानआङ्गिरस
उत्-तान आङ्गिरस
 is mentioned in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 
as a quasi-mythical person who received all good things, and 
yet was not harmed, as he was really a form of the earth, 
according to Sāyaṇa's
	2 explanation. His name occurs also in 
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	3 the Pancaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	4 and the 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.

उदङ्कशौल्बायन
उद्-अङ्क शौल्बायन
 — His views on Brahman, which he 
identified with the vital airs (prāṇa), are mentioned in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 1, 3). He would thus have been 
a contemporary of Janaka of Videha. He is also mentioned in 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vii. 5, 4, 2) as holding that the 
Daśarātra ceremony was the prosperity or best part of the 
Sattra (‘sacrificial session’).

उदञ्चन
उद्-अञ्चन
 — This word, occurring only metaphorically in the 
Rigveda,
	1 means a ‘pail’ or ‘bucket’ in the Brāhmaṇas.

उदल
उदल,
 a Vaiśvāmitra, is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃsa 
Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 11, 33) as the seer of a Sāman.

उदाज
उद्-आज
 is the word used in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	1 to denote 
the share of the booty of war taken by the king after a victory 
(saṃgrāmaṃ jitvā). This interpretation, which is that of 
Delbrück,
	2 is clearly correct, as against the older version, 
‘march out,’ given by von Schroeder
	3 and accepted by 
Böhtlingk.
	4 The Udāja thus corresponds precisely with the 
Homeric  This sense also suits Nirāja, the variant of 
both the Kāṭhaka
	5 and the Kapiṣṭhala

उदान
उदान
 is usually the fifth of the vital breaths (Prāṇa) when 
five are enumerated.
	1 Sometimes
	2 it appears as the second, 
coming after Prāṇa, and followed by Vyāna or Samāna. 
Again,
	3 it is found simply opposed to Prāṇa, or it simply follows 
Prāṇa and Apāna.
	4 In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	5 it is treated 
as the breath that consumes food, a notion traceable in 
the later Upaniṣads,
	6 while it is also regarded as the wind 
that rises up by the throat,
	7 and leads the spirit forth at 
death.

उदीच्यस्
उद्-ईच्यस्
 — The Brāhmaṇas of the northern parts are referred 
to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as engaging, with Svaidāyana 
Śaunaka as their spokesman, in a dispute with the Kurupañcāla 
Brāhmaṇa Uddālaka Āruṇi, and as vanquishing him. Their 
relation to the Kurupañcālas appears also from the fact that in 
the same Brāhmaṇa
	2 reference is made to the speech of the 
north being similar to that of the Kurupañcālas. The speech 
of the Northerners was also celebrated for purity; hence 
Brāhmaṇas used to go to the north for purposes of study, 
according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,
	3 while in the Buddhist 
texts the school of Takṣaśilā (in Gandhāra) is famous as a 
resort of students.
	4 Possibly, too, Sanskrit was specially 
developed in Kaśmīr, as suggested by Franke.

उदुम्बर
 — This name of the Ficus glomerata does not occur 
in the Rigveda, but is often found from the Atharvaveda
	1 
onwards. For ritual purposes of all kinds its wood was 
constantly used. The sacrificial post (yūpa)
	2 and the sacrificial 
ladle
	3 were made of it, and amulets of Udumbara are 
mentioned.
	4 Its wood, like that of other kinds of figtree — 
Aśvattha, Nyagrodha, and Plakṣa — was considered suitable 
for employment at the sacrifice.
	5 The sweetness of its fruit is 
referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	6 where it is put on the 
same level as Madhu. It is there also spoken of as ripening 
three times a year.
	7 A forest of Udumbara trees is mentioned 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

उद्दालकआरुणि
उद्दालक आरुणि
 — Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the 
most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāh
maṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa.
	1 This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was 
teacher of Proti Kausurubindi of Kauśāmbī,
	2 and that his son 
Svetaketu is found disputing among the Pañcālas.
	3 He was a 
pupil of Aruṇa, his father,
	4 as well as of Patañcala Kāpya,
	5 of 
Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya
	6 
Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki,
	7 although the former is represented 
elsewhere
	8 as having silenced him. He overcame in argument 
Prācīnayogya Śauceya,
	9 and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājāta
śatrava,
	10 though the text here seems to read the name as 
Āraṇi. He was a Gautama,
	11 and is often alluded to as such. 
As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is 
repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	12 the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	13 the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	14 and occasionally in the Aitareya,
	15 the 
Kauṣītaki,
	16 and the Ṣaḍviṃśa
	17 Brāhmaṇas, as well as the 
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.
	18 In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not 
mentioned, according to Geldner,
	19 but only his father Aruṇa; 
his name does not occur, according to Weber,
	20 in the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	21 he is, as 
Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of Divodāsa Bhaimaseni, and 
in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	22 he is mentioned as 
serving Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya. In the Taittirīya tradition he 
seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	23 
to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	24 Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who 
is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.
	25 But the episode of 
Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of 
historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous 
Śvetaketu, who is expressly reported by Āpastamba
	26 to have 
been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of 
importance for the date of Āruṇi. 1) xi. 4, 1, 2. Cf. Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6. 2) xii. 2, 2, 13. 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1;

of the East, 41, 141, has Āraṇi. There 
is a chronological difficulty in taking 
Āruṇi as meant, since Ājātaśatrava 
must presumably have been a descen
dant of Ajātaśatru, a contemporary of 
Janaka (see Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 1), 
who again was a patron of Yājñavalkya, 
a pupil of Āruṇi. But this difficulty is 
not fatal. 11) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 3, 2;

उद्दालकायन
उद्दालकायन
 is mentioned as a pupil of Jābālāyana in the 
second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) contained in the Kāṇva recen
sion of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 6, 2).

उद्र
उद्र
 is the name of an animal occurring only in the list of 
sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha given in the Saṃhitās of 
the Yajurveda.
	1 According to Mahīdhara
	2 it was a crab; but 
as the commentary on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 calls it a water
cat, there can be no doubt that it was an otter. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 20, 1;

उपकेतु
उप-केतु
 is the name of a man mentioned in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā (xiii. 1).

उपकोसलकामलायन
उप-कोसल कामलायन
 is mentioned as a teacher and a 
pupil of Satyakāma Jābāla in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 
(iv. 10, 1; 14, 1).

उपक्वस
उप-क्वस
 is the name in the Atharvaveda (vi. 50, 2) of a 
noxious insect injurious to seed. Sāyaṇa, however, reads the 
word as a plural adjective (a-pakvasaḥ = a-dagdāḥ), but the 
Paippalāda recension supports the form upakvasaḥ.

Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
486; Whitney's Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 318.

उप-गु सौश्रवस
 is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa (xiv. 6, 8) as Purohita of Kutsa Aurava, by whom he 
was murdered because of his paying homage to Indra. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268; Hopkins, Transactions of the Con- 
necticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 57.

उपचित्
उप-चित्
 occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 as the name of 
a disease, which Roth
	2 renders as ‘swelling,’ and which 
Bloomfield
	3 identifies with Apacit. 1) xii. 97. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Proceedings of the American Oriental 
Society, October, 1887, xviii.

उपजिह्विका
उप-जिह्विका, उप-जीका, उप-दीका
 are all forms of one word 
denoting a species of ant.
	1 To these ants is attributed in the 
Atharvaveda
	2 the power of penetrating to water which possesses 
curative properties. They were accordingly used in all sorts of 
spells against poisoning. The belief in their healing qualities 
was no doubt due to the well-known properties of the earth of 
ant-heaps which contains their water. 1) Upajihvikā is the form in Rv. viii. 
102, 21; upajīkā in Av. ii. 3, 4; vi. 100, 
2; but upacīkā in both passages in the 
Paippalāda recension; upadīkā in the

153.

उपधान
उप-धान
 denotes the ‘cushion’ of a seat (Āsandī) in the 
Atharvaveda (xiv. 2, 65). It corresponds to the Upabarhaṇa 
of other texts.

उपधि
उप-धि
 occurs once each in the Rigveda
	1 and the Athar
vaveda,
	2 in conjunction with Pradhi, denoting part of the 
wheel of a chariot. It is impossible to decide exactly what 
part is meant. Roth,
	3 Zimmer
	4 and Bloomfield,
	5 agree in 
thinking that the word denotes the spokes collectively. 
Whitney,
	6 considering this improbable, prefers to see in it the 
designation of a solid wheel, Pradhi being presumably the rim 
and Upadhi the rest. Other possibilities
	7 are that the Upadhi 
is a rim beneath the felly, or the felly itself as compared with 
the tire (ordinarily Pavi). 1) ii. 39, 4. 2) vi. 70, 3. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Altindisches Leben, 248 (ignoring the 
Atharvaveda passage). 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 493. 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda,

उपनिषद्
उप-निषद्
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 normally denotes the ‘secret 
sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the 
mendicant. But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	2 it is already 
used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no 
doubt actually existing and similar to the Upaniṣads in the 
nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly 
the sections of the Taittirīya Upaniṣad end with the words 
ity upaniṣad. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	3 commences its third 
part with the title ‘The Upaniṣad of the Saṃhitā,’ and the 
title occurs also in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.
	4 The exact 
primary sense of the expression is doubtful. The natural 
derivation, adopted by Max Müller
	5 and usual ever since, 
makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret 
doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine. 
Oldenberg,
	6 however, traces the use of the word to the earlier 
sense of ‘worship’ (cf. upāsana). Deussen
	7 considers the 
original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’ 
and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is im
probable. Hopkins
	8 suggests that Upaniṣad denotes a sub
sidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for 
the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more 
frequent than any other. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 3, 5, 12; 
4, 5, 1; 5, 1, 1; xii. 2, 2, 23, etc.;

उपपति
उप-पति,
 ‘the gallant,’ is mentioned with the Jāra, ‘lover,’

(puruṣamedha). 1) xxx. 9; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 1.

उपबर्हण
उप-बर्हण
 denotes a ‘pillow’ or ‘cushion,’ especially of a 
seat (āsandī), occurring in the Rigveda,
	1 the Atharvaveda,
	2 and 
the Brāhmaṇas.
	3 The feminine Upabarhaṇī is found in the 
Rigveda with the same sense, but used metaphorically of the 
earth. 1) x. 85, 7. 2) ix. 5, 28; xii. 2, 19. 20; xv. 3, 7. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 12; Śata

उप-मन्थनी
 is used in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	1 to 
denote ‘churning sticks.’ In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	2 the 
‘churner’ (upamanthitṛ) is included in the list of victims at the 
human sacrifice (puruṣamedha), and the verb upa-manth is often 
used of churning or mixing fluids.

उपमन्यु
उप-मन्यु
 is, according to Ludwig,
	1 the name of a person 
in the Rigveda,
	2 but is more probably explained by Roth
	3 as a 
mere epithet. 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 113. 2) i. 102. 9. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

उपमश्रवस्
उपम-श्रवस्
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as 
a son of Kuruśravaṇa, and grandson of Medhātithi. The 
exact force of the reference to him in however, uncertain. 
According to the Bṛhaddevatā,
	2 followed by Ludwig,
	3 and by 
Lanman,
	4 the poet in the hymn consoles Upamaśravas for the 
death of his grandfather, Medhātithi. Geldner,
	5 on the other 
hand, thinks that the poet, who was Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, was 
ill-treated by his patron's son, Upamaśravas, and cast into 
a ditch or well, where he uttered his complaint and appeal for 
mercy. But of this there is no adequate evidence, and the 
tradition of the Bṛhaddevatā seems sound. 1) x. 33, 6. 7. 2) vii. 35. 36, with Macdonell's 
notes. 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165. 4) Sanskrit reader, 386, 389. 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 150, n.

उपमित्
उप-मित्
 occurs twice in the Rigveda,
	1 and once in the 
Atharvaveda,
	2 as the designation of some part of a house. The 
passages in the Rigveda leave little doubt that the word means 
an upright pillar. As it is, in the Atharvaveda, coupled with 
Parimit and Pratimit, the conclusion is natural that the latter 
word denotes the beams supporting the Upamit, presumably by 
leaning against it at an angle, while Parimit denotes the beams 
connecting the Upamits horizontally. These interpretations, 
however, can only be conjectural. See also Gṛha. 1) i. 59, 1; iv. 5, 1. 2) ix. 3, 1.

Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
596; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 525.

उपर
उपर,
 which, according to Pischel,
	1 means ‘stone’ in 
general, is the technical name of the stone on which the Soma 
plant was laid in order to be pounded for the extraction of the 
juice by other stones (adri, grāvan). The word is rare, occur
ring only thrice in the Rigveda,
	2 and once in the Atharvaveda.
	3 1) Vedische Studien, 1, 109. This is the 
sense of the form upala (Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xxv. 8, etc.). 2) i. 79, 3; x. 94, 5; 175, 3. 3) vi. 49, 3.

1, 154; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 317; Von Schroeder, 
Mysterium und Mimus, 414.

उपलप्रक्षिणी
उपल-प्रक्षिणी
 occurs once in the Rigveda,
	1 where it desig
nates the occupation of a woman, as opposed to that of her 
son, who is a poet (kāru), and to that of his father, who is a 
physician (bhiṣaj). Yāska
	2 renders the word by ‘maker of 
groats’ (saktu-kārikā), and Roth,
	3 Grassmann,
	4 Zimmer,
	5 as well 
as others, connect it with the operation of grinding corn. 
Pischel,
	6 however, who points out that corn was not ground 
between two stones, but beaten on a stone with a pestle (dṛṣad), 
considers that Upala-prakṣiṇī denotes a woman that assisted at 
the crushing of Soma (cf. Upara). Von Schroeder,
	7 who more 
correctly points out that there is no objection to regarding 
upala as the mortar in which the corn was placed and then 
beaten with the pestle, renders the word literally as ‘one who 
fills the (lower) stone (with corn).’ 1) ix. 112, 3. 2) Nirukta, vi. 5. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Ibid., s.v., ‘fitting the upper (to the 
lower) millstone.’ 5) Altindisches Leben, 269. Cf. Hille
brandt, Vedaschrestomathie, s.v., who, 
taking pṛc in the sense of ‘fill,’ explains 
the compound as ‘filling the upper mill
stone,’ an interpretation which as it 
stands is unintelligible. 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 308-310. 7) Mysterium und Mimus, 412 et seq. 
Von Schroeder does not accept the 
view that the mother of the singer is 
alluded to; but it seems impossible to 
draw any other conclusion from the 
language of the passage, and his own 
explanation of the word as refer
ring to a corn-mother is very im
probable; cf. Keith, Journal of the Royal 
Asiatic Society, 1909, 204.

उपला
उपला
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 may denote the upper and smaller 
‘stone,’ which was used as a pestle with the Dṛṣad as the 
mortar, whereas Upara in the Saṃhitās denotes rather the 
mortar, and Dṛṣad the pestle. But see Dṛṣad. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22;

उपवाक
उप-वाक
 occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 and the Brāh
maṇas
	2 as a description of a species of grain, the Wrightia 
antidysenterica, known later as Indra-yava. The commentator 
Mahīdhara
	3 simply glosses it with the more general term Yava. 
According to the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, it formed the essential 
element of gruel (karambha), and Upavāka groats (saktavaḥ) are 
mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	4 1) xix. 22; 90; xxi. 30 (as ‘heal
ing’). 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 1, 3;

उपवेशि
उप-वेशि
 is mentioned as a pupil of Kuśri in a Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 3, in both 
recensions). See also Aupaveśi.

उपश्री
उप-श्री, उप-श्रय,
 are two readings of the same term. The 
former is found in one recension of the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,
	1 
while the latter is probably the reading of the other recension 
of the Upaniṣad,
	2 and certainly the reading in one passage of 
the Atharvaveda,
	3 though the text has apaśrayaḥ, which is 
accepted as possible by Roth.
	4 In both cases the term clearly 
means something connected with a couch (Āsandī in the 
Atharvaveda, Paryaṅka in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad). Aufrecht,
	5 
Roth,
	6 and Max Müller
	7 render it as ‘coverlet’ or ‘cushion,’ 
but Whitney
	8 seems evidently right in holding that it must 
mean a ‘support’ or something similar. 1) i. 5. 2) See Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,

उपस्तरण
उप-स्तरण
 denotes in the description of the couch (Par- 
yaṅka) in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	1 a ‘coverlet,’ and has this 
sense, used metaphorically, in the Rigveda
	2 also. In the 
Atharvaveda
	3 it seems to have the same meaning. Whitney,
	4 
however, renders it ‘couch,’ though he translates
	5 the parallel 
word Āstaraṇa in another passage
	6 by ‘cushion.’ 1) i. 5. 2) ix. 69, 5. 3) v. 19, 12. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda,

उपस्ति
उप-स्ति
 denotes both in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 a 
‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic
	3 the subordination of the 
Vaiśya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb 
upa-sthā, ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears, 
with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the 
Rigveda.
	4 The exact nature of the dependence connoted by 
the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer
	5 conjectures that the 
‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who 
became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and 
Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost 
their freedom through dicing.
	6 The evidence of the Athar
vaveda
	7 shows that among the Upastis were included the 
chariot-makers (ratha-kāra), the smiths (takṣan), and the 
charioteers (sūta), and troop-leaders (grāma-ṇī), while the 
Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ (sti) 
being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that 
they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but 
attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary 
population. They may well have included among them not 
only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements, 
such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men 
who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the 
Sūta and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's house
hold — kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described 
in the Atharvaveda.
	8 The use of the word in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā,
	9 the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	10 and the Kāṭhaka,
	11 is 
purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the 
Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippalāda recension of 
the Atharvaveda,
	12 Vaiśya, Śūdra, and Ārya are referred to as 
Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’ 1) x. 97, 23 (= Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,

उपस्तुत
उप-स्तुत
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda,
	1 always 
as a sage of old, and usually in connexion with Kaṇva, who 
was aided or favoured by Agni, the Aśvins, and other gods. 
The Upastutas, sons of Vṛṣṭihavya,

उपह्वर
उप-ह्वर
 denotes, in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 according 
to Geldner,
	2 the body of a chariot (upa-stha). 1) i. 87, 2. 2) Vedische Studien, 3, 40.

उपानस
उपानस
 is in the Atharvaveda
	1 opposed to Akṣa, and must 
mean something like ‘the body of the wagon,’ though Sāyaṇa 
suggests that it signifies either a ‘granary’ or a ‘wagon full of 
grain.’ In the Rigveda,
	2 where the word occurs only once, its 
sense is doubtful. Pischel
	3 explains the form which occurs 
there not as an adjective, but as an infinitive. 1) ii. 14, 2. 2) x. 105, 4. 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 197. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 301; Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 56.

उपानह्
उपा-नह्
 is the regular word for a ‘sandal’ or ‘shoe’ from 
the later Saṃhitās
	1 onwards. Boarskin is mentioned in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 as a material of which shoes were made. 
The combination ‘staff and sandals’ (daṇḍopānaha) occurs as 
early as the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.
	3 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 4, 4; 
6, 6, 1, etc. 2) v. 4, 3, 19. 3) iii. 3.

उपाविजानश्रुतेय
उपावि जान-श्रुतेय
 is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 
(i. 25, 15) as an authority on the Upasads (a kind of Soma 
ceremony).

उपोदितिगौपालेय
उपोदिति गौपालेय
 is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa (xii. 13, 11) as a seer of Sāmans.

उभयादत्|उभयादन्त्
उभया-दन्त्,
 ‘having incisors in both jaws,’ is an expression 
employed to distinguish, among domestic animals, the horse, 
the ass, etc., from the goat, the sheep, and cattle. The 
distinction occurs in a late hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 and is several 
times alluded to in the later Saṃhitās
	2 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	3 
In one passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	4 man is classed with 
the horse as ubhayā-dant. The opposite is anyato-dant, ‘having 
incisors in one jaw only,’ a term regularly applied to cattle,
	5 
the eight incisors of which are, in fact, limited to the lower jaw. 
The ass is styled ubhayā-dant in the Atharvaveda.
	6 In one 
passage of the Atharvaveda,
	7 however, the epithet is applied to 
a ram; but the sense here is that a marvel occurs, just as in 
the Rigveda
	8 a ram destroys a lioness. Bloomfield
	9 suggests 
in the Atharvaveda passage another reading which would mean 
‘horse.’ A parallel division of animals is that of the Taittirīya
	10 
and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās
	11 into ‘whole-hoofed’ (eka-śapha) and 
‘small’ (kṣudra). 
Zimmer
	12 seeks to show from the Greek 
	13 and the 
Latin ambidens
	14 that the Indo-European was familiar with 
the division of the five sacrificial animals into the two classes 
of man and horse on the one hand, and cattle, sheep, and 
goats on the other. But this supposition is not necessary. 1) x. 90, 10. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 6, 3; 
v. 1, 2, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 1. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 3, 30

उरा
उरा
 as a name for ‘sheep’ is confined to the Rigveda.
	1 It 
is curious that in one of its two occurrences the wolf should be 
referred to as terrifying sheep, and that the epithet of the wolf, 
urā-mathi, ‘killing sheep,’ should occur once in the Rigveda,
	2 
both references being in one book of the Saṃhitā, a fact 
which suggests a dialectical origin of the word urā. See 
also Avi. 1) viii. 34, 3. 2) viii. 66, 8. Cf. Nirukta, v. 21.

उरुकक्ष
उरु-कक्ष
 occurs in only one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 
where the sense of the word is much disputed. The reading 
of the text is uruḥ kakṣo na gāṅgyaḥ, which may refer to a man, 
Urukakṣa, ‘dwelling on the Ganges,’
	2 or to a man, son of 
Gaṅgā, or to a wood so called,
	3 or may simply denote the 
‘broad thicket on the Ganges.’

उरुक्षय
उरु-क्षय
 — A family of Urukṣayas, singers and worshippers 
of Agni, is referred to in one hymn of the Rigveda (x. 118, 8. 9). 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167.

उरुञ्जिरा
उरुञ्जिरा
 is given in the Nirukta (ix. 26) as one of the names 
of the river Vipāś (now Beäs).

उर्वरा
उर्वरा
 is with Kṣetra the regular expression, from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (). 
Fertile (apnasvatī) fields
	2 are spoken of as well as waste fields 
(ārtanā).
	3 Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is 
clearly referred to both in the Rigveda
	4 and in the Atharva
veda,
	5 while allusion is also made to the use of manure.
	6 The 
fields (kṣetra) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda.
	7 
This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the 
plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in 
a hymn of the Rigveda,
	8 to her father's field (urvarā), which 
is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal 
possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning 
fields’ (urvarā-sā, urvarā-jit, kṣetra-sā),
	9 while ‘lord of fields’ 
used of a god
	10 is presumably a transfer of a human epithet 
(urvarā-pati). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same 
connexion as children,
	11 and the conquest of fields (kṣetrāṇi 
saṃ-ji) is often referred to in the Saṃhitās.
	12 Very probably, as 
suggested by Pischel,
	13 the ploughland was bounded by grass 
land (perhaps denoted by Khila, Khilya) which in all likelihood 
would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere. 
There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property 
in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort,
	14 nor is 
there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property 
in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad
	15 the things given as examples of wealth include 
fields and houses (āyatanāni). The Greek evidence
	16 also 
points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the 
ownership is of course not determined by the expression 
‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head 
of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can 
only be conjectured (see Pitṛ). Very often a family may have 
lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules 
about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the 
Sūtras.
	17 In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	18 the giving of land as 
a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no 
doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to 
be given away or parted with.

others see Grāma; on its cultivation see Kṛṣi. 1) i. 127, 6; iv. 41, 6; v. 33, 4;

Of course, the rules probably go back 
to the earlier period, but how far it is 
impossible to say. With the settlement 
of the country, however, inheritance of 
land and its partition must have become 
inevitable. 18) xiii. 6, 2, 18; 7, 1, 13. 15. 19) It is significant that in the famous 
episode (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1, 9, 4) 
of Manu's division of his property, 
from which Nābhānediṣṭha was ex
cluded, this exclusion is made good by 
the son's obtaining cattle (paśavaḥ). It 
is clear that cattle, not land, was the 
real foundation of wealth, just as in 
Ireland, Italy (cf. pecunia), Greece, etc. 
Cattle could be, and were, used indi
vidually, but land was not open to a 
man's free disposal; no doubt, at any 
rate, the consent of the family or the 
community might be required, but we 
are reduced to reliance on analogy in 
view of the silence of the texts. Cf. 
Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 289; 
Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 94-96; Rhys 
Davids, Buddhist India, 48 et seq.

उर्वारू
उर्वारू,
 f., Urvāruka, n., ‘cucumber.’ The former
	1 of these 
words denotes the plant, the latter
	2 the fruit, but both are very 
rare. The passages all seem to refer to the fact that the stem 
of the plant becomes loosened when the fruit is ripe.

Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 6, 3).

उलूक
उलूक
 is the ordinary word for ‘owl’ from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards. The bird was noted for its cry,
	2 and was deemed 
the harbinger of ill-fortune (nairṛta).
	3 Owls were offered at the 
horse sacrifice to the forest trees,
	4 no doubt because they 
roosted there. 1) x. 165, 4. 2) Rv. loc. cit. 3) Av. vi. 19, 2: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v.

उलूखल
उलूखल
 is the regular expression for ‘mortar’ from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards, occurring frequently also in the compound
	2 
Ulūkala-musala, ‘mortar and pestle.’ The exact construction 
of the vessel is quite unknown till we reach the Sūtra period. 1) i. 28, 6; Av. x. 9, 26; xi. 3, 3;

उल्मुकवक्षयण
 is an expression that occurs several 
times in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 signifying a ‘means of 
extinguishing (ava-kṣayaṇa) a firebrand,’ or possibly more pre
cisely ‘tongs.’ Compare Aṅgārāvakṣayaṇa. 1) iv. 6. 8, 7; v. 2, 4, 15; xi. 6, 3, 3; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 76. Cf. Böhtlingk,

उशीनर
उशीनर
 — In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā
	1 the Kuru-Pañcālas are 
mentioned as dwelling together in the ‘Middle Country’ with 
the Vaśas and the Uśīnaras. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	2 also 
the Uśīnaras are associated with the Kuru-Pañcālas and Vaśas, 
but in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 the Uśīnaras and Vaśas are re
garded as northerners. In the Rigveda
	4 the people is alluded to 
in one passage by reference to their queen, Uśīnarāṇī. Zimmer
	5 
thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west, 
but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based 
merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda 
ascribes one hymn
	6 to Śibi Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were 
known to Alexander's followers as ,
	7 living between the 
Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way 
conclusive, as the Śibis, at any rate in Epic times,
	8 occupied 
the land to the north of Kurukṣetra, and there is no reason 
whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Uśīnaras were 
farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’ 1) viii. 14. 2) iv. 1. See Keith Śāṅkhāyana

āraṇyaka (iii. 5, 1) and Chāndogya (i. 10, 1; 11, 1) Upaniṣads, 
the name in the latter work appearing as Uṣasti.

उष्टि
उष्टि, उष्ट्र
 — Both of these words, of which the former is 
quite rare,
	1 must have the same sense. Roth
	2 and Aufrecht
	3 
hold that in the Rigveda
	4 and the Brāhmaṇas
	5 the sense is 
‘humped bull’ or ‘buffalo,’ but the former thinks that in the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	6 the sense is doubtful, and ‘camel’ may be 
meant. Hopkins
	7 is decidedly of opinion that the sense in 
every case is ‘camel.’ The animal was used as a beast of 
burden yoked in fours.

उष्णीष
उष्णीष
 denotes the ‘turban’ worn by Vedic Indians, men 
and women
	1 alike. The Vrātya's turban is expressly referred 
to in the Atharvaveda
	2 and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

उष्यल
उष्यल
 occurs once in the description of the couch or the 
bridal car in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it seems to mean the four 
‘frame-pieces.’ The form is doubtful: uṣpala is possible.

उस्र
उस्र,
 m.; Usrā, f.; Usrika, m.; Usriya, m.; Usriyā, f. All 
these words denote a ‘bull’ or a ‘cow,’ occurring frequently in 
the Rigveda,
	1 and sometimes later,
	2 but usually with some 
reference to the morning light. In some passages the sense is 
doubtful. See Go. 1) Usra, Rv. vi. 12, 4; usrā, i. 3, 8;

vṛṣabhaḥ); ix. 74. 3; usriyā, i. 153, 4; 
180, 3; ii. 40, 2, etc. In ix. 70, 6, 
usriya is applied to a calf; and in 
ix. 68, 1; 93, 2, usriyā means ‘milk.’ 2) Usrau dhūrṣāhau, Vājasaneyi Saṃ

	1 as a pupil of Bhānumant Aupamanyava. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

ऊर्जयन्ती
ऊर्जयन्ती
 is regarded by Ludwig
	1 in one passage of the

	2 as the name of a fort, the stronghold of Nārmara. 
The verse is, however, quite unintelligible.

ऊर्जव्य
ऊर्जव्य,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 is 
taken by Ludwig
	2 to be the name of a sacrificer. Roth,
	3 how

ऊर्णनाभी
ऊर्ण-नाभी,
 
	1 Ūrṇa-vābhi, Ūrṇā-vant are all names of the 
spider in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas in allusion to 
the insect's spinning threads of wool, as it were. 1) Ūrṇa-nābhi (‘having wool in its 
navel’), Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 
5; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 23; 
ūrṇa-vābhī (‘wool-spinner’), Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, viii. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
xiv. 5, 1, 23; ūrṇā-vant (‘possessing 
wool’), Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xix. 3 (in 
a Mantra).

ऊर्णा
ऊर्णा,
 ‘wool,’ is very frequently mentioned from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards. The Paruṣṇī country was famous for its wool,
	2 like 
Gandhāra
	3 for its sheep. The term for the separate tufts was 
parvan
	4 or parus.
	5 ‘Soft as wool’ (ūrṇa-mradas)
	6 is not a rare 
epithet. The sheep is called ‘woolly’ (ūrṇāvatī).
	7 ‘Woollen 
thread’ (ūrṇā-sūtra) is repeatedly referred to in the later 
Saṃhitās
	8 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	9 The word ūrṇā was not 
restricted to the sense of sheep's wool,
	10 but might denote goat's 
hair also.

ऊर्णावती
ऊर्णा-वती
 — In the hymn of the Rigveda
	1 which celebrates 
the rivers Ludwig
	2 finds a reference to an affluent of the Indus 
called Ūrṇāvatī. This interpretation, however, seems certainly 
wrong. Roth
	3 renders the word merely as ‘woolly,’ and Zimmer
	4 
rejects Ludwig's explanation on the ground that it throws the 
structure of the hymn into confusion. Pischel
	5 makes the 
word an epithet of the Indus, ‘rich in sheep.’ 1) x. 75. 8. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3.

ऊर्दर
ऊर्दर
 — This word occurs once in the Rigveda,
	1 when 
reference is made to filling Indra with Soma as one fills an 
Ūrdara with grain (Yava). Sāyaṇa renders it granāry, but 
Roth
	2 and Zimmer
	3 seem more correct in simply making it a 
measure for holding grain, or ‘garner.’ 1) ii. 14, 11. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 238.

ऊल
ऊल
 is a variant of Ula.

ऋक्ष
1. Ṛkṣa, ‘bear,’ is found only once in the Rigveda,
	1 and seldom 
later,
	2 the animal having evidently been scarce in the regions 
occupied by the Vedic Indians. Not more frequent
	3 is the use 
of the word in the plural to denote the ‘seven bears,’ later 
called the ‘seven Ṛṣis,’
	4 the constellation of the ‘Great Bear’ 
(, ursa). 1) v. 56, 3. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17;

ऋक्ष
2. Ṛkṣa is the name of a patron mentioned in one verse of a

referred to in the next verse as Ārkṣa. 1) viii. 68, 15. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

ऋक्षाका
ऋक्षाका
 is a word occurring once in an obscure passage of the 
Atharvaveda.
	1 The sense is quite unknown. Weber
	2 thinks 
it refers to the ‘milky way,’ but his view rests on no evidence. 
Whitney
	3 despairs of the passage. 1) xviii. 2, 31. 2) Festgruss an Roth, 138, n. 2; Berlin

ऋक्षीका,
 a word found in the Atharvaveda,
	1 the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	2 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 appears to denote a 
demon. Harisvāmin, however, in his commentary on the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, connects the word with Ṛkṣa, as meaning 
‘bear.’ 1) xii. 1, 49. 2) xxx. 8. 3) xiii. 2, 4, 2. 4. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 44, 307.

ऋजिश्वन्
ऋजिश्वन्
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda,
	1 but 
always in a vague manner, as if very ancient. He assists 
Indra in fights against demoniac figures like Pipru and the 
dusky brood (kṛṣṇa-garbhāḥ). According to Ludwig,
	2 he was 
called Auśija's son,
	3 but this is doubtful. He is twice
	4 clearly 
called Vaidathina, or descendant of Vidathin. 1) i. 51, 5; 53, 8; 101, 1; vi. 20, 7;

	1 along with 
six other Soma sacrificers. 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

ऋज्राश्व
ऋज्राश्व
 appears in the Rigveda
	1 as one of the Vārṣāgiras, 
along with Ambarīṣa, Surādhas, Sahadeva, and Bhayamāna, 
and as apparently victorious in a race. Elsewhere
	2 in the 
Rigveda he is celebrated as having been blinded by his father 
for slaying one hundred rams for a she-wolf, and as having 
been restored to sight by the Aśvins, a legend of quite obscure 
meaning. 
Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 52. 1) i. 100, 16. 17. 2) i. 116, 17; 117, 16. 17.

ऋण
ऋण,
 ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among 
the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made
	2 to debts con
tracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called ṛṇaṃ saṃ-nī.
	3 
Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of 
payment.
	4 
The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious: 
the dicer might fall into slavery.
	5 Debtors, like other male
factors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their 
creditors to posts (dru-pada),
	6 presumably as a means of 
putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the 
debt. 
The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out. 
In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda
	7 an eighth 
(śapha) and a sixteenth (kalā) are mentioned as paid, but it is 
quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the 
principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid 
in kind. 
How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does 
not appear. The Kauśika Sūtra
	8 regards three hymns of the 
Atharvaveda
	9 as applicable to the occasion of the payment of 
a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt. 
by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear.
	10 
Zimmer
	11 thinks that payments of debt were made in the 
presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of 
dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting 
solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda.
	12 1) ii. 27, 4, etc., usually in a meta
phorical sense. 2) Rv. x. 34, 10; Av. vi. 119, 1. 3) Rv. viii. 47, 17 = Av. vi. 46, 3. 4) Av. vi. 119, 1. 5) Rv. x. 34. Cf. Lüders, Das Wūrfel- 
spiel im alten Indien, 61. 6) Rv. x. 34, 4, seems to refer rather 
to the binding and taking away as a 
slave, though Pischel, Vedische Studien, 
1, 228, explains it as the binding of a 
debtor for non-payment, interpreting 
the obscure verse i. 169, 7, in the same 
way. But Av. vi. 115, 2, 3, may refer 
to debt, and if this is the meaning the 
allusion to binding to a post as a punish
ment is clear. See, however, Bloom
field, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 528, 
n. 1; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 364, who interprets the 
hymn as referring only to sin. Rv. 
i. 24, 13. 15; Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4; 
121, 1 et seq., are general; while Rv. 
vii. 86, 5; Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, refer 
to the binding of thieves in the 
stocks. Cf. Taskara. 7) Rv. viii. 47, 17 = Av. vi. 46, 3. 8) xlvi. 36-40. See Caland, Altindisches 
Zauberritual, 154; Bloomfield, op. cit., 
528. 9) vi. 117-119. The name for unpaid 
debt is in Av. vi. 117, 1, apamityam 
apratītam. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
iii. 3, 8, 1, kusīdam apratīttam; in the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 14, 17, and 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 1, 8, kusīdam 
apratītam; in the Mantra Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 3. 20, apradattam. 10) Cf. Rv. iv. 3, 13 (a brother's sin 
or debt); Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 99, 100. 11) Altindisches Leben, 181. This sug
gestion is ignored by Bloomfield, op. cit., 
375, and Whitney, op. cit., 304. 12) vi. 32, 3 = viii. 8, 21. Cf. Śāṅkh

ऋणंचय
ऋणं-चय,
 a prince of the Ruśamas, is celebrated in a 
Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) of the Rigveda (v. 30, 12. 14) for 
his generosity to a poet named Babhru. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129; Bṛhadevatā, ed. Macdonell, 2, 169, 174.

ऋतु
ऋतु,
 ‘season,’ is a term repeatedly mentioned from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards, Three seasons of the year are often 
alluded to,
	2 but the names are not usually specified. In one 
passage of the Rigveda
	3 spring (vasanta), summer (grīṣma), and 
autumn (śarad) are given. The Rigveda knows also the rainy 
season (prā-vṛṣ) and the winter (himā, hemanta). A more 
usual
	4 division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons, 
vasanta, grīṣma, varṣā, śarad, hemama-siśira, but occasionally 
the five are otherwise divided, varṣā-śarad being made one 
season.
	5 Sometimes six
	6 seasons are reckoned, hemanta and 
śiśira being divided, so that the six seasons can be made 
parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more 
artificial arrangement
	7 makes the seasons seven, possibly by 
reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and 
Zimmer
	8 hold, or more probably because of the predilection 
for the number seven, as Roth
	9 suggests. Occasionally the 
word ṛtu is applied to the months.
	10 The last season, 
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	11 is hemanta. 
The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five 
is rightly explained by Zimmer
	12 as indicating the advance of 
the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but 
dominates the later Saṃhitās. Traces of an earlier division of 
the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the 
Rigveda, where the appropriate words himā and samā are 
merely general appellations of the year, and where śarad
	13 is 
commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it 
denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a 
young agricultural people. The division of the year in one 
passage of the Atharvaveda
	14 into two periods of six months 
is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old 
tradition. 1) i. 49, 3; 84, 18, etc. 2) Cf. Rv. i. 164, 2 (tri-nābhi), 48 (trīṇi 
nabhyāni); also perhaps the Ṛbhus as 
the genii of the three seasons and the 
three dawns. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic 
Mythology, p. 133; Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 2, 33 et seq.: Śatapatha Brāh

ऋत्विज्
ऋत्व्-इज्
 is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all 
the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It 
appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas.
	1 The 
number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions 
was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one 
passage of the Rigveda,
	2 enumerates their names as Hotṛ, Potṛ, 
Neṣṭṛ, Agnīdh, Praśāstṛ, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the 
institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably 
explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in 
the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the 
mythical ‘seven Ṛṣis.’ It may be compared with the eight of 
Iran.
	3 The chief of the seven priests was the Hotṛ, who was 
the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer 
also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the 
sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered 
formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assist
ance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the 
smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The 
Praśāstṛ, Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously 
called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving in
structions to the Hotṛ, and as entrusted with certain litanies. 
The Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the 
Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Brāhmaṇāc
chaṃsin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later 
ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the 
Rigveda
	4 are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ 
and his assistant the Prastotṛ, while the Pratihartṛ, another 
assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been 
known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage 
of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of 
sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use 
of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests, 
such as the Achāvāka,
	5 the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the 
Subrahmaṇya, were known later in the developed ritual of the 
Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically 
and artificially classed in four groups
	6 Hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa, 
Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, and 
Subrahmaṇya; Adhvaryu, Pratisthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Unnetṛ; 
Brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, and Petṛ. 
Apart from all these priests was the Purohita, who was 
the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties. 
Geldner
	7 holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually 
took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of 
the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the 
whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in 
a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda
	8 and the 
later literature,
	9 where Purohita and Brahman were combined 
or identified. Oldenberg,
	10 however, more correctly points out 
that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita 
was then normally the Hotṛ, the singer of the most important 
of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the 
capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda, 
acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised 
by the Purohita, who was ex officio skilled in the use of magic 
and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied 
to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees 
the fact that Agni, pre-eminently
	11 the Purohita of men, is also 
a Hotṛ, and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are 
called
	12 the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule 
is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	13 that a 
Kṣatriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	14 the Vasiṣṭha family have a special 
claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indi
cation that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the 
function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial 
ritual. 
The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great 
majority of cases. The Sattra,
	15 or prolonged sacrificial session, 
was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests 
taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be 
secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated 
(dīkṣita). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The 
sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about 
the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that 
the prayer
	16 for welfare includes by name only the priest and 
the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with 
the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture. 1) This is assumed throughout the 
Vedic texts, and is accompanied by 
the rule that no Kṣatriya can eat of 
the sacrificial offering (Cf. Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26): no doubt because 
only the Brāhmaṇas were sufficiently 
holy to receive the divine essence of 
the sacrifice into which, by partaking 
of it, the deity has entered in part. 2) ii. 1, 2. Cf. Oldenberg. Rdigion 
des Veda, 383. 3) Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, 1,

of the four sets is Hotṛ, Brahman, 
Udgātṛ, and Adhvaryu. Sometimes a 
seventeenth priest is mentioned, but 
he was not usually approved, though 
the Kauṣītakins maintained him as the 
Sadasya. See Satapatha Brāhmaṇa,

Brāhmaṇa
	1 with the patronymic Yājñatura, as one of those 
who performed an Aśvamedha or horse sacrifice. He is also 
mentioned there
	2 as having probably been the source of a 
saying of Gaurīviti Śāktya's. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 15. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9. 8-10. 2) xii. 8, 3. 7.

ऋषभ
3. Ṛṣabha is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 17) 
as a son of Viśvāmitra.

ऋषि
ऋषि,
 ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods. 
In the Rigveda
	1 reference is often made to previous singers 
and to contemporary poets. Old poems were inherited and 
refurbished by members of the composer's family,
	2 but the 
great aim of the singers was to produce new and approved 
hymns.
	3 It is not till the time of the Brāhmaṇas that the 
composition of hymns appears to have fallen into disuse,
	4 
though poetry was still produced, for example, in the form of 
Gāthās, which the priests were required to compose them
selves
	5 and sing to the accompaniment of the lute at the 
sacrifice. The Ṛṣi was the most exalted of Brāhmaṇas,
	6 and 
his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter,
	7 
was regarded as heaven-sent.
	8 The Purohita, whether as Hotṛ 
or as Brahman (see Ṛtvij), was a singer.
	9 No doubt the Ṛṣis 
were normally
	10 attached to the houses of the great, the petty 
kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household. 
Nor need it be doubted that occasionally
	11 the princes them
selves essayed poetry: a Rājanyarṣi, the prototype of the later 
Rājarṣi or ‘royal seer,’ who appears in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa,
	12 though he must be mythical as Oldenberg
	13 
points out, indicates that kings cultivated poetry
	14 just as later 
they engaged in philosophic disputations.
	15 Normally, how
ever, the poetical function is Brahminical, Viśāmitra and others 
not being kings, but merely Brāhmaṇas, in the Rigveda. 
In the later literature the Ṛṣis are the poets of the hymns 
preserved in the Saṃhitās. a Ṛṣi being regularly
	16 cited when 
a Vedic Saṃhitā is quoted. Moreover, the Ṛṣis become the 
representatives of a sacred past, and are regarded as holy sages, 
whose deeds are narrated as if they were the deeds of gods or 
Asuras.
	17 They are typified by a particular group of seven,
	18 
mentioned four times in the Rigveda,
	19 several times in the 
later Saṃhitās,
	20 and enumerated in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad
	21 as Gotama, Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, 
Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, and Atri. In the Rigveda itself Kutsa,
	22 
Atri,
	23 Rebha,
	24 Agastya,
	25 the Kuśikas,
	26 Vasiṣṭha,
	27 Vyaśva,
	28 
and others appear as Ṛṣis; and the Atharvaveda
	29 contains a 
long list, including Aṅgiras, Agastī, Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa, 
Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gaviṣṭhira, Viśvāmitra, Kutsa, Kakṣīvant, 
Kaṇva, Medhātithi, Triśoka, Uśanā Kāvya, Gotama, and 
Mudgala. 
Competition among the bards appears to have been known. 
This is one of the sides of the riddle poetry (Brahmodya) that 
forms a distinctive feature
	30 of the Vedic ritual of the Aśva
medha, or horse sacrifice. In the Upaniṣad period such 
competitions were quite frequent. The most famous was that 
of Yājñavalkya, which was held at the court of Janaka of 
Videha, as detailed in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	31 and 
which was a source of annoyance to Ajātaśatru of Kāśī.
	32 
According to an analogous practice, a Brāhmaṇa, like Uddālaka 
Aruṇi, would go about disputing with all he came across, and 
compete with them for a prize of money.

10; x. 39, 14. So a poet is a Kāru
(if from kṛ, ‘make,’ but usually derived 
from kṛ, ‘commemorate’), and makes 
(kṛ, Rv. ii. 39. 8; viii. 62, 4) as well as 
creates (jan, Rv. vii. 15, 4; viii. 88, 4) 
hymns. 8) Rv. i. 37, 4; vii. 36. 1. 9; viii. 32,

 — The term ‘Seven Ṛṣis’ denotes the ‘Great Bear’ (see 
1. Ṛkṣa) in one passage of the Rigveda,

Ṛkṣas, brought about by the frequent mention of the seven Ṛṣis. 1) x. 82, 2. 2) Av vi. 40, 1 (where, however, 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva

‘sole Aṣṭakā,’ must denote not merely any Aṣṭakā, but some

the date meant by the term as the eighth day in the dark half 
of the month of Māgha (January — February). The Ekāṣṭakā, 
is declared in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā

एणी
एणी
 denotes the ‘female antelope’ in the later Saṃhitās,

एत
एत
 in the plural (etāḥ) denotes the steeds of the Maruts, 
being a swift species of deer, which are mentioned several 
times in the Rigveda,
	1 and the skins of which are also said to 
be worn by the Maruts on their shoulders.

budhna, once applied to them in the Rigveda,
	3 and variously 
interpreted as ‘broad-hoofed,’
	4 ‘broad-chested,’

the hinder part,’

एतश
1. Etaśa is in several passages of the Rigveda,
	1 according to 
Roth
	2 the name of a protégé whom Indra helped against the 
sun-god Sūrya. But in all these passages Etaśa seems merely 
to designate the horse of the sun.

एतश
2. Etaśa is in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	1 the name of a sage 
who is said to have cursed his children because they interrupted 
him in the midst of a rite; hence the Aitaśāyanas (descendants 
of Etaśa) are declared to be the worst of the Bhṛgus. The 
same story appears in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā
	2 where, how
ever, the sage's name is Aitaśa, and the Aitaśāyanas are 
described as the worst of the Aurvas. 1) xxx. 5. 2) vi. 33. Cf. Hillebrandt. Vedische Mythologie, 2, 173.

एदिधिषुःपति
एदिधिषुः-पति
 is a term occurring only in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	1 where the commentator Mahīdhara interprets it as 
meaning the ‘husband of a younger sister married before the 
elder sister.’ Though this sense is probably correct, the form 
is doubtless, as Delbrück
	2 points out, corrupt. See Didhiṣūpati. 1) xxx. 9. 2) Die indogermanischen Verwandschaftsnamen, 569. n. 1.

एरण्ड
एरण्ड,
 the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis), is first 
mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (xii. 8).

एवावद
एवावद
 is regarded by Ludwig
	1 in a very obscure passage 
of the Rigveda
	2 as the name of a singer beside Kṣatra, Manasa, 
and Yajata. The commentator Sāyaṇa also interprets the 
word as a proper name. Roth,
	3 however, considers it to be an 
adjective meaning ‘truthful.’ 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
138. 2) v. 44, 10. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

ऐकादशाक्षमानुतन्तव्य
ऐकादशाक्ष मानु-तन्तव्य
 appears in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa
	1 as a king who observed the rule of sacrificing when the 
sun had risen (udita-homin), and as a contemporary of Nagarin 
Jāna-śruteya. 1) v. 30. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 223.

ऐक्ष्वाक
ऐक्ष्वाक,
 ‘descendant of Ikṣvāku,’ is the patronymic borne 
by Purukutsa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Another Aikṣvāka 
is Vārṣṇi, a teacher mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa.
	2 A king Hariścandra Vaidhasa Aikṣvāka is known 
to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 and Tryaruṇa is an Aikṣvāka in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

ऐतरेय
ऐतरेय,
 perhaps a patronymic from Itara, though the 
commentator Sāyaṇa
	1 regards the word as a metronymic from 
Itarā, is an epithet of Mahidāsa in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	2 and 
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	3 1) Cited by Aufrecht, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 3. 2) ii. 1, 8; 3. 7. 3) iii. 16, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische 
Studien, 1, 389. The form Aitareyin 
occurs in the Anupada Sūtra, viii. 1; 
Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 3, etc.; 
and a Mahaitareya in Āśvalāyana 
Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4, etc.

ऐतश
ऐतश, ऐतशायन
 See Etaśa, Etaśāyana. The Aitaśa
pralāpa, or ‘Discourse of Aitaśa,’ is a part of the Atharvaveda.

ऐतिहासिक
ऐति-हासिक
 — This term was applied to the people who 
explained the Vedic hymns by treating them as legendary 
history (Itihāsa), as Sieg
	1 shows by the passages of the 
Nirukta,
	2 where their views are opposed to those of the 
Nairuktas, who relied rather on etymology. Sieg
	3 also seems 
right in finding them in the Naidānas of the Nirukta:
	4 it is 
possible that their textbook was called the Nidāna. 1) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 13 et seq. 2) ii. 16; xii. 1, etc. 3) Op. cit., 29. 4) vi. 9; vii. 6.

ऐभावत
ऐभावत,
 ‘descendant of Ibhāvant,’ is the patronymic of 
Pratīdarśa.
	1 1) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 2, 3.

ऐरावत
ऐरावत,
 ‘son of Irāvant,’ is the patronymic of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, 
as a snake demon,
	1 in the Atharvaveda
	2 and the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	3 1) In the later literature Airāvata is 
the elephant of Indra: perhaps con
nected with this Vedic snake demon. 
as nāga means both ‘serpent’ and 
‘elephant.’ 2) viii. 10, 29. 3) xxv. 15, 3.

ऐलूष
ऐलूष,
 ‘descendant of Ilūṣa,’ is the patronymic of Kavaṣa.

ऐषकृत
ऐष-कृत

ऐषावीर
ऐषा-वीर
 — The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa once
	1 refers to the 
Aiṣā-vīras as officiating at a sacrifice, with the implication that 
they were bad sacrificers. Sāyaṇa regards the word as a 
proper name (‘descendants of Eṣavīra’), denoting the members 
of a despised family. But Roth may be right in explaining 
the word both in the passage mentioned above and elsewhere 
as meaning ‘weak’
	2 or ‘insignificant man.’
	3 1) xi. 2, 7, 32. 2) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v. 3) In Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. 
(‘one who wishes to be a man, but is 
not’). Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 
1, 16; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, where, 
however, Lindner's edition reads saiṣā 
vīra iva. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
1, 228; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 44, 45.

ऐषुमत

Trāta in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

ओगण
ओगण
 is a word occurring only once, as a plural, in the 
Rigveda,
	1 where it appears to indicate persons hostile to the 
seer of the hymn, and apparently opposed to the Āryan religion. 
Ludwig
	2 regards the terms as the proper name of a people, but 
Pischel
	3 thinks that it is merely an adjective meaning ‘weak’ 
(ogaṇa = ava-gaṇa), as in Pāli. 1) x. 89, 15 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 5, 209. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 191, 192.

ओतु
ओतु
 in Vedic literature
	1 denotes the ‘woof’ in weaving and 
corresponds to Tantu, ‘the warp,’ the roots vā,
	2 ‘to weave,’ 
and tan,
	3 to stretch,’ from which these two terms are derived, 
being used in parallel senses. In the process of weaving a 
shuttle (Tasara) was used. The ‘weaver’ is termed vāya,
	4 and 
the ‘loom’ veman.
	5 A wooden peg (Mayūkha) was used to 
stretch the web on, while lead was employed as a weight to 
extend it.
	6 
The work of weaving was probably the special care of 
women.
	7 A metaphor in the Atharvaveda
	8 personifies Night 
and Day as two sisters weaving the web of the year, the 
nights serving as warp, the days as woof. 1) Rv. vi. 9, 2. 3; Av. xiv. 2, 51;

ओपश
ओपश
 is a word of somewhat doubtful sense, occurring in 
the Rigveda,
	1 the Atharvaveda,
	2 and occasionally later.
	3 It 
probably means a ‘plait’ as used in dressing the hair, especially 
of women,
	4 but apparently, in earlier times,
	5 of men also. 
The goddess Sinīvālī is called svaupaśā,
	6 an epithet of doubtful 
sense, from which Zimmer
	7 conjectures that the wearing of 
false plaits of hair was not unknown in Vedic times. What 
was the difference between the braids referred to in the 
epithets pṛthu ṣṭuka,
	8 ‘having broad braids,’ and viṣita-ṣṭuka,
	9 
‘having loosened braids,’ and the Opaśa cannot be made out 
from the evidence available. Geldner
	10 thinks that the original 
sense was ‘horn,’ and that when the word applies to Indra
	11 
it means ‘diadem.’ 1) x. 85. 8, Cf. i. 173, 6; viii. 14, 5; 
ix. 71. 1. 2) vi. 138, 1. 2; ix. 3, 8, where it is 
applied metaphorically in describing 
the roof of a house. 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 1. 4) Av. vi. 138. 1, 2. 5) Rv. i. 173, 6; viii. 14, 5. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 5, 3;

saneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 56. The reading 
is uncertain. Bloomfield (see below) 
assumes sv-opaśā to be the correct form 
(‘having a fair opaśa’). 7) Altindisches Leben, 264. 8) Rv. x. 86, 8. 9) Rv. i. 167, 5 (of Rodasī). 10) Vedische Studien, 1, 131, quoting

ओषधि
ओषधि
 — Roughly speaking, the vegetable world is divided 
in Vedic literature
	1 between Oṣadhi or Vīrudh ‘plants’ and 
Vana or Vṛkṣa ‘trees.’ Oṣadhi is employed in opposition to 
Vīrudh to denote plants as possessing a healing power or some 
other quality useful to men, while Vīrudh is rather a generic 
term for minor vegetable growths, but sometimes,
	2 when occur
ring beside Oṣadhi, signifies those plants which do not possess 
medicinal properties. 
A list of the minor parts of which a plant is made up is given 
in the later Saṃhitās.
	3 It comprises the root (mūla), the 
panicle (tūla), the stem (kāṇḍa), the twig (valśa), the flower 
(puṣpa), and the fruit (phala), while trees
	4 have, in addition, a 
corona (skandha), branches (śākhā), and leaves (parṇa). The 
Atharvaveda
	5 gives an elaborate, though not very intelligible, 
division of plants into those which expand (pra-stṛṇatīḥ), are 
bushy (stambinīḥ), have only one sheath (eka-śuṅgāḥ), are 
creepers (pra-tanvatīḥ), have many stalks (aṃśumatīḥ), are 
jointed (kāṇḍinīḥ), or have spreading branches (vi-śākhāḥ). In 
the Rigveda
	6 plants are termed ‘fruitful’ (phalinīḥ), ‘blossom
ing’ (puṣpavatīḥ), and ‘having flowers’ (pra-sūvarīḥ). 1) Rv. x. 97 and passim. Oṣadhi- 
vanaspati is a frequent compound, from 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (vi. 1, 1, 12) 
onwards. The medicinal properties of 
plants account for the epithet ‘of 
manifold powers’ (nānā-vīryā) applied 
to them in Av. xii. 1, 2. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 2. 3) Ibid., vii. 3, 19, 1; Vājasaneyi

औक्षगन्धि
औक्ष-गन्धि
 (‘having the smell of bull's grease’) appears 
in the Atharvaveda
	1 as the name of an Apsaras, beside other 
names, of which Guggulū and Naladī clearly indicate plants. 
This name, therefore, presumably also denotes some sort of 
fragrant plant. Aukṣa in the same Saṃhitā
	2 means ‘bull's 
grease’ (from akṣan, ‘bull’). 1) iv. 37. 3. 2) ii. 36. 7.

औदन्य,
 ‘descendant of Udanya or Odana,’ is the patro
nymic in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 of Muṇḍibha, who is 
credited with inventing an expiation for the crime of slaying a 
Brahmin. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 the name appears in 
the form of Audanyava. 1) xiii. 3, 5, 4. 2) iii. 9, 15, 3. Cf. St. Petersburg

	1 reading of the name of the Ātreya, 
who was Purohita of Aṅga Vairocana, according to the

और्णवाभ
और्ण-वाभ,
 ‘descendant of Ūrṇavābhi.’ (1) This is the 
name of a pupil of Kauṇḍinya mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 (2) A teacher 
of this name is frequently referred to in the Nirukta. His 
explanations in two passages
	2 agree with those of the Nairuktas 
or etymological school of interpreters of the Rigveda. In other 
passages
	3 he appears rather to belong to the school of the 
Aitihāsikas, who relied on traditional legends. He was thus 
probably, as Sieg
	4 suggests, an eclectic. 1) iv. 5, 26 (Mādhyaṃdina recension). 2) vii. 15; xii. 19. 3) vi. 13; xii. 1. 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 13, n. 1.

और्व
और्व,
 ‘descendant of Uru or Urva,’ appears in the Rigveda
	1 
in close connexion with Bhṛgu, being probably a Bhṛgu 
himself. As in one passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	2 the 
descendants of Aitaśa are called the worst of the Aurvas, while 
the parallel version of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	3 calls them the 
worst of the Bhṛgus, the Aurvas must have been a branch of 
the larger family of the Bhṛgus. Aurva himself is said in the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	4 to have received offspring from Atri. In 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	5 two Aurvas are referred to as 
authorities. See also Kutsa. 1) viii. 102, 4. 2) vi. 33. 3) xxx. 5. 4) vii. 1, 8, 1. 5) xxi. 10, 6. Hopkins, Transactions 
of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 54, reads ūrvau. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 
2, 173, n. 1.

औलान
औलान
 is a word occurring in a single passage of the 
Rigveda,
	1 where it may possibly be a patronymic of Śaṃtanu 
as a ‘descendant of Ula.’ Ludwig,
	2 however, conjectures that 
the reading should be ‘Kaulāna.’ Sieg
	3 regards Aulāna as

औलुण्ड्य
औलुण्ड्य,
 ‘descendant of Uluṇḍa,’ is the patronymic of 
Supratīta in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

औशिज
औशिज,
 ‘descendant of Uśij,’ is a patronymic clearly applied 
to Kakṣīvant in the Rigveda.
	1 It is also applied to Ṛjiśvan,
	2 
but Ludwig
	3 thinks that the correct reading of the passage in 
question is auśijasyarjiśvā, ‘Ṛjiśvan, son of Auśija.’ In one 
verse
	4 Auśija and Kakṣīvant are both mentioned, but in such a 
way that two different persons must apparently be meant. In 
other passages where the patronymic occurs alone, it is doubtful 
who is meant, or whether a proper name at all is intended.

Kakṣīvant Auśija appears also in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	6 
and elsewhere. 1) i. 18, 1. 2) x. 99, 11. 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 143,

 ‘descendant of Uṣṭrākṣa,’ occurs as the patro
nymic of Sāti in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

कंस,
 a word denoting a ‘pot or vessel of metal,’ occurs in

yana Āraṇyaka, xii. 8.

ककर
ककर
 occurs in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 as the name of a 
victim at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha). It probably denotes 
some ‘sort of bird,’ as rendered by the commentator Mahī
dhara.

ककुठ
ककुठ,
 a word occurring in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,

	2 it is identical with Kakkaṭa. 1) iii. 14, 13. 2) Dictionary, s.v.

ककुह
ककुह,
 a word occurring several times in the Rigveda,
	1 is 
understood by Roth
	2 to designate part of a chariot, perhaps the 
seat. Ludwig,
	3 again, regards it in one passage
	4 as the proper 
name of a Yādava prince who took spoil from Tirindira, the 
Parśu, but this view is hardly probable.
	5 It is, on the whole, 
most likely that the word always means ‘chief,’ ‘pre-eminent,’ 
being applied as an epithet to horses, chariots, princes, etc.
	6 
This is the only sense given by Grassmann,
	7 and later adopted 
by Roth.

 denotes the ‘crab’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 
being a Prākritized form of Karkaṭa, which is common in the 
later literature.

	3 however, takes the word to mean a 
bird, and compares Kakara. See also Kakuṭha. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1

कक्ष
कक्ष
 is the name of two men mentioned as teachers in a 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa. 
One is Kakṣa Vārakya, pupil of Proṣṭhapada Vārakya,
	1 and

कक्षीवत्|कक्षीवन्त्
कक्षीवन्त्
 is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned frequently in the 
Rigveda,
	1 and occasionally elsewhere.
	2 He appears to have 
been a descendant of a female slave named Uśij.
	3 He must 
have been a Pajra by family, as he bears the epithet Pajriya,
	4 
and his descendants are called Pajras.
	5 In a hymn of the 
Rigveda
	6 he celebrates the prince Svanaya Bhāvya, who 
dwelt on the Sindhu (Indus), as having bestowed magnificent 
gifts on him; and the list of Nārāśaṃsas (‘Praises of Heroes’) 
in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	7 mentions one by Kakṣīvant 
Auśija in honour of Svanaya Bhāvayavya. In his old age he 
obtained as a wife the maiden Vṛcayā.
	8 He appears to have 
lived to be a hundred,
	9 the typical length of life in the Vedas. 
He seems always to be thought of as belonging to the past, and 
in a hymn of the fourth book of the Rigveda
	10 he is mentioned 
with the semi-mythical Kutsa and Kavi Uśanas. Later, also, 
he is a teacher of bygone days.
	11 
In Vedic literature he is not connected with Dīrghatamas 
beyond being once mentioned along with him in a hymn of the 
Rigveda.
	12 But in the Bṛhaddevatā
	13 he appears as a son of 
Dīrghatamas by a slave woman, Uśij. 
Weber
	14 considers that Kakṣīvant was originally a Kṣatriya, 
not a Brāhmaṇa, quoting in favour of this view the fact that 
he is mentioned beside kings like Para Āṭṇāra, Vītahavya 
Śrāyasa, and Trasadasyu Paurukutsya.
	15 But that these are 
all kings is an unnecessary assumption: these persons are 
mentioned in the passages in question undoubtedly only as 
famous men of old, to whom are ascribed mythical sacrificial 
performances, and who thus gained numerous sons. 1) i. 18, 1; 51, 13; 112, 11; 116, 7;

कङ्क
कङ्क
 is the name of a bird, usually taken to mean ‘heron,’
	1 
but, at any rate in some passages, rather denoting some bird of 
prey.
	2 It first appears in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.

कङ्कतीय
कङ्कतीय
 is the name of a family said in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 to have learned from Śāṇḍilya the piling up of the 
sacrificial fire (agni-cayana.) In the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra
	2 
a Kaṅkati Brāhmaṇa, no doubt the textbook of the school, is 
referred to. It may have been identical with the Chāgaleya 
Brāhmaṇa, cited in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.

कङ्कपर्वन्
कङ्क-पर्वन्
 (‘heron-jointed’?), a term occurring once in 
the Atharvaveda,
	1 is applied to a snake, meaning perhaps 
‘scorpion.’ As the Paippalāda recension has a different reading 
(aṅga-parvaṇaḥ), the passage may be corrupt. 1) vii. 56, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches

कट
कट
 denotes a ‘mat,’ which was ‘made of reeds’ (vaitasa). 
The maker of mats from reeds (bidala-kārī) is mentioned in the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	2 and the process of splitting reeds for the 
purpose is referred to in the Atharvaveda.

कण्टकीकारी
कण्टकी-कारी,
 ‘worker in thorns,’ is one of the victims at 
the human sacrifice (Puruṣamedha) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	1 
No doubt the thorns were cut up and used to plait mats (Kaṭa) 
or to stuff cushions. 1) xxx. 8. The Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 5, 1, has kaṇṭaka-kāra. Cf. Zimmer,

कण्व
कण्व
 is the name of an ancient Ṛṣi repeatedly referred to 
in the Rigveda and later.
	1 His sons and descendants,
	2 the 
Kaṇvas, are also often mentioned, especially in the eighth 
book of the Rigveda, the authorship of that book, as well as of 
part of the first, being attributed to this family. A descendant 
of Kaṇva is also denoted by the name in the singular, either 
alone
	3 or accompanied by a patronymic, as Kaṇva Nārṣada
	4 
and Kaṇva Śrāyasa,
	5 besides in the plural the Kaṇvas Sauśra
vasas.
	6 The Kaṇva family appears to have been connected with 
the Atri family,
	7 but not to have been of great importance.
	8 In 
one passage of the Atharvaveda
	9 they seem to be definitely 
regarded with hostility. 1) Rv. i. 36, 8. 10. 11. 17. 19; 39, 7. 9;

कना
कना, कन्या
 — Both these words, of which the former is 
very rare,
	1 while the latter is the normal term from the Rigveda
	2 
onwards, denote ‘maiden’ or ‘young woman.’ It is doubtful 
whether Kanīnakā (accented on the final syllable) has this 
meaning,
	3 or only denotes the pupil of the eye,
	4 which is the 
sense of kanīnakā or kanīnikā (both accented on the ante
penultimate) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. See

23; x. 40, 9; Nirukta, iv. 15; but 
neither of the Rv. passages is at all 
clear. 4) See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 401; Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyāka,

कपना
कपना,
 from its solitary occurrence in the Rigveda,
	1 appears 
to mean a ‘worm’ that destroys the leaves of trees, and is so 
interpreted in the Nirukta.
	2 1) v. 54, 6. 2) vi. 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 97; Max Müller, Sacred Books of 
the East, 32, 330.

कपर्द
कपर्द,
 ‘braid,’ Kapardin, ‘wearing braids.’ These words 
refer to the Vedic custom of wearing the hair in braids or 
plaits. Thus a maiden is said to have her hair in four plaits 
(catuṣ-kapardā),
	1 and the goddess Sinīvālī is described as ‘wear
ing fair braids’ (su-kapardā).
	2 Men also wore their hair in this 
style, for both Rudra
	3 and Pūṣan
	4 are said to have done so, 
while the Vasiṣṭhas
	5 were distinguished by wearing their hair 
in a plait on the right (dakṣiṇatas-kaparda). The opposite was 
to wear one's hair ‘plain’ (pulasti).

कपि
1. Kapi, ‘monkey,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda
	1 with 
reference to Vṛṣā-kapi, the ‘Man-ape,’ in the dialogue of Indra 
and Indrāṇī in the presence of Vṛṣākapi. There the ape is 
termed the ‘tawny’ (harita). In the Atharvaveda
	2 the monkey 
is mentioned several times as hairy, and an enemy of dogs. 
That the ape was tamed appears from its position in the 
Vṛṣākapi hymn, and from the mention, in the Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā,
	3 of a Mayu as belonging to the forest. See also Mayu, 
Markaṭa, and Puruṣa Hastin. 1) x. 86. 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion

कपि
2. Kapi is, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
another name for Luśa Khārgali in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 
(xxx. 2), but the name appears rather to be Luśākapi.

कपिञ्जल

cock,’ is found in all the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,

 appears in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad
	1 as a teacher,

कपोत
कपोत
 is the name of a bird, probably the ‘pigeon’ (its 
sense in the later language), occurring from the Rigveda 
onwards.
	1 It is associated in some passages
	2 with the owl 
(Ulūka) as a messenger of Nirṛti (‘dissolution,’ ‘misfortune’). 
This aspect of the pigeon as a bird of evil omen is probably 
based on an ancient belief which is also found beyond the 
confines of India.

कबन्धआथर्वण
कबन्ध आथर्वण
 is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad
	1 along with Sudhanvan Āṅgirasa, as a teacher, but 
is semi-mythical. His son was Vicārin Kābandhi. 1) vi. 7, 1. Cf. also Gopatha Brāh

कमद्यू
कम-द्यू
 appears once in the Rigveda
	1 as the wife of 
Vimada. She is probably identical with the ‘maiden’ (yoṣā) 
of Purumitra, no doubt his daughter. She is elsewhere
	2 
referred to in connexion with Vimada, who appears to have 
taken her for his bride against the will of her father. 1) x. 65, 12. 2) i. 117, 20; x. 39, 7. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben,

	1 a ‘woollen coverlet’ 
or ‘blanket.’ 1) xiv. 2, 66. 67. Cf. Nirukta, ii. 2.

कम्बोज
कम्बोज। — यास्क,
 in the Nirukta,
	1 refers to the speech of 
the Kambojas as differing from that of the other Āryas. The 
Kambojas were later settled to the north-west of the Indus, and 
are known as Kambujiya in the old Persian inscriptions. A 
teacher, Kāmboja Aupamanyava, pupil of Madragāra, is 
mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	2 This points to a possible 
connexion of the Madras, or more probably the Uttara Madras, 
with the Kambojas, who probably had Iranian as well as Indian 
affinities. 1) ii. 2. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

करञ्ज
करञ्ज,
 a word which in the Sūtras and later denotes the 
tree Pongamia glabra, occurs only twice in the Rigveda
	1 as 
the name of a foe of Indra, but whether a demon or a man
	2 is 
intended remains uncertain. 1) i. 53, 8; x. 48, 8. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63;

करम्भ
करम्भ
 is the name, from the Rigveda onwards,
	1 of a kind 
of porridge made of grain (Yava), which was unhusked, parched 
slightly, and kneaded.
	2 It was the especial sacrificial portion of 
Pūṣan, no doubt in his capacity of an agricultural deity. 
Karmabha was also made of barley (Upavāka)
	3 or of sesame 
(Tirya).

करिक्रत
 denotes, according to Zimmer,
	1 a snake in the 
Atharvaveda.

करीर,
 the name of a leafless shrub, Capparis aphylla, or its 
fruit, first appears in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.

 denotes ‘dry cow dung’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 
The Atharvaveda
	2 shows that the value of the natural manure 
of animals in the fields was appreciated. 1) ii. 1, 1, 7. 2) Av. iii. 14, 3. 4; xix. 31, 3. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236.

कर्कन्धु
1. Karkandhu is the ordinary word for ‘jujube,’ the tree 
(Zizyphus jujuba) and the fruit, from the Yajurveda Saṃhitās 
onwards.
	1 The berry is red (rohita).
	2 Compare Kuvala and 
Badara, which denote the fruit. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xix. 23. 91; xxi. 32; xxiv. 2;

कर्कन्धु
2. Karkandhu is only the name borne by a protégé of the 
Aśvins in the Rigveda (i. 112, 6). Its identity with the word 
for jujube indicates that the latter, though not otherwise 
mentioned there, was known at the time of the Rigveda.

कर्करि
कर्करि,
 a musical instrument, probably the ‘lute,’ occurs 
from the Rigveda onwards.
	1 The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	2 
mentions cattle branded on the ears with a mark resembling 
a lute (karkari-karṇyaḥ). 1) Rv. ii. 43, 3; Av. iv. 37. 4. Cf.

kaumudī, 48, 49.

कर्की
कर्की
 may denote in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 a 
white cow,’ according to the suggestion of Roth.
	2 1) iv. 38, 6. 7. Cf. Bloomfield Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 414. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary and 
Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v.

कर्णशोभन
कर्ण-शोभन
 denotes an ‘ornament for the ear’ in the 
Rigveda,
	1 apparently for the use of men. Some deity is called 
‘gold-eared’ in another passage of the Rigveda.
	2 Hopkins
	3 
considers the use of ear-rings later than that of necklets and 
wristlets. 1) viii. 78, 3. 2) i. 122, 14. See also i. 64, 10. 3) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 17, 35.

कर्णश्रवसाङ्गिरस
कर्ण-श्रवस् आङ्गिरस
 is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 11, 14) as a seer of Sāmans or chants, the 
same tale being told of him as of Dāvasu.

कर्मार
कर्मार,
 the ‘smith,’ is several times mentioned with 
approval in the Vedic Saṃhitās.
	1 In the Atharvaveda
	2 smiths 
appear with fishermen (dhīvānaḥ) and chariot-builders (ratha- 
kārāḥ), all being classified as clever workers (manīṣiṇaḥ): 
possibly a quasi-caste of smiths was already developing from 
the guild organization that probably existed.
	3 
Little is known of the smith's methods of work and of his 
tools. No doubt he smelted (dhmā) the ore in the fire; hence 
he is called dhmātṛ, the ‘smelter.’
	4 Mention is also made of 
his bellows of birds' feathers.
	5 He made metal vessels (gharma 
ayasmaya)
	6 to be put on the fire: even the Soma cup could 
occasionally be made of hammered metal (ayo-hata).
	7 1) Rv. x. 72, 2; Av. iii. 5, 6; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27; 
xxx. 7. Cf. karmāra, Rv. ix. 112, 2; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1. 2) iii. 5, 6. The exact sense of the 
passage is doubtful. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 252; Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 144; and Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 92, 
take the reference to be to ‘skilled 
chariot-makers’ (dhīvāno ratha-kārāḥ) 
and ‘clever smiths,’ but this is perhaps 
less likely. The commentator interprets 
dhīvānaḥ as ‘fishermen’ (in the later 
language dhīvara means both a ‘clever 
man’ and a ‘fisherman’). 3) Cf. Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 182. 4) Rv. v. 9. 5. 5) Rv. ix. 112, 2. 6) Rv. v. 30, 15. 7) Rv. ix. 1, 2.

den Rājasūya, 19 et seq.

कर्वर
कर्वर,
 a word found in one passage of the Atharvaveda.
	1 
seems to mean some kind of fish
	2 caught by a fisherman 
(pauñjiṣṭha). 1) x. 4, 19. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 96; 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 578.

कर्षू
कर्षू,
 a rare word found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 
denotes a ‘furrow’ or ‘trench.’ 1) i. 8, 1, 3; xiii. 8, 3, 10. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 283.

कलविङ्क
कलविङ्क,
 a name of the ‘sparrow,’ is found in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 and occasionally later.
	2 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 2; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 1; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Vājasaneyi Samhitā,

3 (Transactions of the Connecticut Academy 
of Arts and Sciences, 15, 181). Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91.

कलश
कलश
 is, from the Rigveda onwards,
	1 a common word for 
‘pot’ or ‘jar,’ probably either formed of a gourd or made of 
clay (unburnt or baked), as we know that both kinds of pot 
were in use.
	2 The wooden Soma tub (droṇa-kalaśa) is frequently 
referred to in the ritual. See also Kośa. 1) Rv. i. 117, 12; iii. 32, 15; iv. 27, 5; 
32, 19, etc.; Av. iii. 12, 7; ix. 1, 6; 
4, 15; xviii. 4, 13, etc. In Rv. x. 32, 9, 
the word, according to the Śt. Peters
burg Dictionary, is used as a proper 
name, but the passage is very doubtful. 2) Av. iv. 17, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
i. 1, 8, 1; iv. 1, 5, 4; v. 1, 7, 2; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, i. 22; xi. 59. Cf.

कला
कला
 denotes a fractional part, normally ‘one-sixteenth,’ in 
the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 It is often mentioned in connexion 
with Śapha, ‘one-eighth.’ 1) viii. 47, 17. 2) Av. vi. 96, 3; xix. 57, 1; Taittirīya

of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278; 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 259.

कलि
1. Kali. See Akṣa.

कलि
2. Kali occurs in the Rigveda, twice in the singular
	1 as the 
name of a protégé of the Aśvins, and once in the plural.
	2 
The persons meant in the latter passage seem to be different 
from the former one. The Kalis are once mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda
	3 beside the Gandharvas.
	4 1) i. 112, 15; x. 39, 8. 2) viii. 66, 15. 3) x. 10, 13. 4) These Kalis may be connected with 
dicing, as in the Atharvaveda the 
Apsarases, the wives of the Gandharvas, 
are fond of dice, and bestow luck at 
play. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 
p. 135. 
Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 17, 89; Ludwig, Trans
lation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

कल्प
कल्प
 in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (ii. 10) seems to denote 
Kalpa Sūtra.

कल्माषग्रीव
कल्माष-ग्रीव
 (‘speckled-neck’) is the name of a snake in 
the Atharvaveda.
	1 1) iii. 27, 5 (where the Paippalāda 
recension has kulmāṣa-); xii. 3, 59. 
Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 2. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 94, 
95.

कल्याण
कल्याण
 is the name, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 of an 
Āṅgirasa who saw the Aurṇāyava Sāman. 1) xii. 11, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 68, n. 2.

कवच
कवच
 denotes a ‘corselet’ or ‘breastplate’ in the Atharva
veda
	1 and later.
	2 There is nothing to show whether it was 
made of metal, but that it was so is quite possible (see 
Varman). The Atharvaveda
	3 refers to a ‘corselet-strap’ 
(kavaca-pāśa), which may point to a linen corselet such as those 
known to Herodotus.
	4 1) Av. xi. 10, 22 (kavacin). 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 2, 7; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 19, 2; Nirukta, 
v. 25 (kavaca); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
xiii. 1, 6, 3; 4, 1, 5; Aitareya Brāh
maṇa, iii. 48; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xvi. 45 (kavacin). 3) xi. 10, 22. 4) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharva- 
veda, 129, and Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 659, seem to recognize 
coats of mail only.

कवष
कवष
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as one of 
those whom, together with the Druhyu king, Indra overthrew 
for the Tṛtsus. The Anukramaṇī (Index) also attributes to 
him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda, including 
two (x. 32. 33) that deal with a prince Kuruśravaṇa and his 
descendant Upamaśravas. There seems no reason to doubt 
this attribution, which is accepted by both Zimmer
	2 and 
Geldner.
	3 The former holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of 
the joint tribes named Vaikarṇa, in whom he sees the Kuru
Krivi (Pañcāla) peoples, and that Kavaṣa in that capacity is 
mentioned in the Rigveda as representative of those peoples. 
He also suggests that the language of Rigveda x. 33, 4 is best 
explained by the reduced position in which the Kuru-Krivis 
found themselves on their defeat by the Tṛtsus. Ludwig,
	4 on 
the other hand, thinks that Kavaṣa was the priest of the five 
peoples. Geldner
	5 holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of 
Kuruśravaṇa, by whose son, Upamaśravas, he was ill-treated, 
and that he composed Rigveda x. 33 to deprecate the anger of 
his royal master. Hopkins
	6 thinks that he was a king. 
In the Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda
	7 mention is made of 
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, who was a Brāhmaṇa born of a female slave, 
and was reproached on this ground by the other Ṛṣis. He is 
possibly identical with the Kavaṣa of the Rigveda. 1) vii. 18, 12. 2) Altindisches Leben, 127. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 150. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139. 5) Loc. cit. 6) Journal of the American Oriental

कशिपु
कशिपु
 denotes a ‘mat’ or ‘cushion’ made, according to the 
Atharvaveda,
	1 by women from reeds (naḍa), which they crushed 
for the purpose by means of stones. On the other hand, the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 refers to a mat as made of gold. 1) vi. 138, 5. 2) xiii. 4, 3, 1.

कशु
कशु
 is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda with 
the patronymic Caidya, or descendant of Cedi, as a generous 
patron of the singer, who praises the liberality of the Cedis. 
Neither this king nor the Cedis appear again in Vedic 
literature. 
^1) viii. 5, 37. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 129.

He is always of a mythical character, as belonging to the distant 
past. According to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 he anointed King 
Viśvakarman Bhauvana, and in the Upaniṣads
	4 he is mentioned 
as a Ṛṣi. The Kaśyapas appear in connexion with Janam-

कारि
कारि
 is the name of one of the victims of the human sacrifice 
(Puruṣamedha) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	1 and is there dedi
cated to ‘laughter.’ The commentator Mahīdhara
	2 interprets 
the word as ‘worker’ (karaṇa-śīla), but the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary suggests that it means a ‘jubilant’ person (as 
derived from the root kṛ, ‘to praise’). 1) xxx. 6. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,

कारीरदि
कारीरदि
 is the name of persons mentioned in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (ii. 4, 4) as holding a special view of the 
Udgītha (Sāmaveda Chant).

कारु
कारु,
 ‘poet,’ is a word almost confined to the Rigveda.
	1 
There is evidence that the poet was regarded as a professional 
man, just as much as the physician (Bhiṣaj).
	2 The poets, no 
doubt, mainly lived at the courts of princes amid their re
tainers,
	3 though they would probably also sing the praises of rich 
merchants. There was probably no essential connexion between 
the priest and the poet. Though the priest was often a poet, 
yet poetry can hardly have been restricted to the priestly caste. 
Indeed, at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	4 expressly requires that one of the singers of pane
gyrics should be a Rājanya, while the other was a Brāhmaṇa, 
both singing verses of their own composition. The Anukra
maṇī (Index) in several cases
	5 attributes hymns of the Rigveda 
to princes; and even though this may often be merely the 
same sort of procedure
	6 as has made Śūdraka the author of 
the Mṛcchakaṭikā, or Harṣa of the Ratnāvalī, and has given 
us royal teachers of the Brahman doctrine,
	7 still the Indian 
tradition evidently saw nothing odd in the idea of non
Brāhmaṇas as poets. Most of the non-sacred poetry has, 
however, disappeared, for the epic is a product, as it stands, 
of a later period. See also Ṛṣi. 1) i. 148, 2; 165, 12; 177, 5; 178, 3; 
ii. 43, 1; iii. 33, 8; 39, 7; v. 33, 7;

Mānava. 6) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 3, 202. 7) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 
20, n. 4, sees in Av. xx. a recension 
of Kṣatriya character. He also finds 
Kṣatriyas in Viśvāmitra and Kakṣīvant, 
but hardly with reason. Cf. Varṇa.

कारोतर
कारोतर
 appears to denote in the Rigveda,
	1 and occasionally 
later,
	2 a ‘filter’ or ‘sieve’ for purifying the liquor called Surā. 1) i. 116, 7. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 16, 82;

कारोती
कारोती
 is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 5, 2, 15) 
as a place, or perhaps a river, where Tura Kāvaṣeya made a 
fire-altar — that is, as a seat of the fire-cult par excellence.

कार्शकेयीपुत्र
कार्शकेयी-पुत्र
 (‘son of Kārśakeyī’) is the name of a man 
mentioned in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadā
raṇyaka Upaniṣad. In the Kāṇva (vi. 5, 2) recension he is a 
pupil of Prācīnayogīputra; in the Mādhyaṃdina (vi. 4, 33) 
recension his teacher's name is Prāśnīputra Āsurivāsin.

कार्ष्णायस
कार्ष्णायस
 (‘black metal’), a word found in the Upaniṣads,
	1 
must clearly mean ‘iron.’ See Ayas. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7;

disches Leben, 52.

कार्ष्मन्
कार्ष्मन्,
 a word meaning literally ‘furrow,’ and found only 
in the Rigveda,
	1 is the designation of the goal in the chariot 
race. The competitor probably turned round it and came back 
to the starting-place.
	2 1) i. 116, 17; ix. 36, 1; 74, 8. 2) Av. ii. 14, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 291, 292.

कार्ष्मर्य
 is the name of a tree (Gmelina arborea) which 
is often alluded to in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

	2 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

vii. 4, 1, 37. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 62.

काल
काल,
 the generic expression for ‘time,’ first occurs in the 
Rigveda,
	1 where, however, it is used only once, in the late 
tenth book. It is known to the Atharvaveda,
	2 where Kāla has 
already developed the sense of time as fate. The word is 
frequent in the Brāhmaṇas,
	3 superseding the earlier use of Ṛtu. 
The more general division of time is into ‘past’ (bhūta), 
‘present’ (bhavat), and ‘future’ (bhaviṣyat).
	4 For other divisions 
see Ahan, Māsa, Saṃvatsara. 1) x. 42, 9. 2) xix. 53. 54. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3;

कालका
कालका
 is the name of one of the victims at the horse 
sacrifice (Aśvamedha) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 variously 
identified with a bird
	2 or a chameleon.

कालकाञ्ज
काल-काञ्ज
 — In the Atharvaveda
	1 mention is made of the 
Kālakāñjas as being in the sky. Both Roth
	2 and Zimmer
	3 
hold that some constellation is meant. But as the defeat of 
the Kālakāñjas is one of Indra's exploits,
	4 it is doubtful whether 
any stress can be laid on that interpretation of the passage in 
the Atharvaveda. Whitney
	5 suggests that the three stars of 
Orion are meant, Bloomfield
	6 that the galaxy or the stars in 
general are intended. 1) vi. 80, 2. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 353. 4) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 1, Cf. also

 — Roth
	1 finds this word, which denotes a species of 
grass (Saccharum spontaneum) used for mats, etc., in one passage 
of the Rigveda,

this sense in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	3 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) x. 100, 10. 3) vi. 9, 1.

काशि
काशि, काश्य
 — The name Kāśi denotes (in the plural
	1) the 
people of Kāśi (Benares), and Kāśya, the king of Kāśi. The 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 tells of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, king of Kāśi, who 
was defeated by Śatānīka Sātrājita, with the result that the 
Kāśis, down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa, gave up the kindling 
of the sacred fire. Sātrājita was a Bharata. We hear also of 
Ajātaśatru as a king of Kāśi;
	3 and no doubt Bhadrasena 
Ajātaśatrava, a contemporary of Uddālaka, was also a king of 
Kāśi. 
The Kāśis and Videhas were closely connected, as was 
natural in view of their geographical position. The compound 
name Kāśi-Videha occurs in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;
	4 in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	5 Gārgī describes Ajātaśatru as either 
a Kāśi or a Videha king. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	6 
mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Kāśi, Kosala, 
and Videha; and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	7 mentions Kāśi 
and Videha in close proximity. Weber,
	8 indeed, throws out 
the suggestion that the Kāśis and the Videhas together con
stitute the Uśīnaras, whose name is very rare in Vedic 
literature. 
As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Kāśi and 
Kosala are found combined in the compound name Kāśi
Kauśalyas of the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.
	9 
Though Kāśi is a late word, it is quite possible that the town 
is older, as the river Varaṇāvatī referred to in the Athar
vaveda
	10 may be connected with the later Vārāṇasī (Benares). 
It is significant that while the Kāśis, Kosalas, and Videhas 
were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pañcala peoples 
may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion 
that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist 
some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture 
in some degree. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	11 in the story of the 
advance of Āryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves 
a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in 
the Kuru-Pañcāla country lay the real centre of the Brāhmaṇa 
culture (see also Kuru-Pañcāla). That the Kosala-Videhas 
were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas 
is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the 
true Brāhmaṇa culture appears to have been brought to them 
from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the 
East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less 
completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the 
movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts
	12 
reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas. 
With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts
	13 display 
towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which 
may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy, 
and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā.
	14 It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas 
and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later 
known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of 
distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost 
their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears 
less likely, though it might be supported by a literal inter
pretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.

goal (paramā kāṣṭhā). 1) i. 37, 10; 65, 3; iv. 58, 7; vi. 46, 1;

कास्
कास्, कास, कासा, कासिका
 — All these four forms
	1 of the same 
word denote ‘cough,’ which is mentioned in the Atharvaveda 
as accompanying a headache,
	2 as a symptom in fever (Takman),

काहोडि
काहोडि
 (‘descendant of Kahoḍa’) is the patronymic of 
Argala in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (xxv. 5).

किंशुक
किंशुक
 is the name of a tree (Butea frondosa) mentioned 
in the wedding hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 the bridal car being 
described as adorned with its blossoms (su-kiṃśuka). 1) x. 85, 20. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 62. Sāyaṇa thinks the meaning 
is that the car is made of the wood of 
the tree.

किकिदीवि
किकि-दीवि
 denotes some kind of bird, perhaps the blue jay.
	1 
According to the commentator, it means ‘partridge’ (tittiri) in 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.

कितव
कितव,
 ‘the gambler,’ is frequently referred to in the Rig
veda
	1 and later.
	2 A father is represented as chastising his son 
for gambling.
	3 The gambler seems at times to have fallen, 
along with his family, into servitude, presumably by selling 
himself to pay his debts.
	4 Technical names
	5 for different sorts 
of gamblers given in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās are Ādinava-darśa, 
Kalpin, Adhi-kalpin, and Sabhā-sthāṇu. None of these can be 
safely
	6 explained, though the last has usually
	7 been taken as a 
satirical name derived from the gambler's devotion to the dicing 
place (Sabhā), ‘pillar of the dicing hall.’ The first literally 
means ‘seeing ill-luck,’
	8 and may refer to the quickness of the 
dicer to note an error on the part of his antagonist, or to his 
eagerness to see the defeat of his rival. 1) ii. 29, 5; v. 85, 8; x. 34, 3. 7. 10.

किम्पुरुष|किंपुरुष
किं-पुरुष,
 lit. ‘what sort of man,’ appears in the Brāh
maṇas
	1 to designate the ‘ape,’ which is a mimic man. Possibly 
the same sense should be seen in the passage of the Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā,
	2 where it occurs, and where Roth
	3 assumes it 
to refer to a contemptible man. Max Müller
	4 renders it 
‘savage.’ 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 8; Sata

कियाम्बु
 is the name of one of the water-plants which are to 
grow, according to a funeral hymn in the Rigveda,
	1 on the place 
where the body of the dead was burned. The word seems to 
mean ‘having some water,’ possibly by popular etymology.

Oriental Society, October, 1890, xl.

किरात
1. Kirāta is a name applied to a people living in the caves 
of the mountains, as appears clearly from the dedication of the 
Kirāta to the caves (guhā) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	1 and 
from the reference in the Atharvaveda
	2 to a Kirāta girl (kairā- 
tikā), who digs a remedy on the ridges of the mountains. 
Later
	3 the people called Kirātas were located in Eastern Nepal, 
but the name seems to have been applied to any hill folk, no 
doubt aborigines, though the Mānava Dharma Śāstra
	4 regards 
them as degraded Kṣatriyas. 1) xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. 2) x. 4, 14. 3) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2,

किरात
2. Kirāta. — In the story of Asamāti there appear, as the two 
priests who are opposed to the Gaupāyanas, Kirāta and Akuli 
according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 or Kilāta and Ākuli 
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 No doubt the name is 
chosen, not as that of a historic person, but as a suitable 
designation of a hostile priest; for it is probably identical with 
the name of the mountaineers described in the preceding article. 1) xiii. 12, 5 (where the text reads 
kirāta-kulyau). Böhtlingk, Dictionary, 
s.v., takes the word, with Sāyaṇa, as 
an adjective, kirāta-kula, ‘of the family 
of Kirāta.’ The reading in the Bṛhad
devatā (vii. 86) is kirātākulī. 2) i. 1, 4, 14 (where the text reads 
kilātākulī). Cf. also Sāṭyāyanaka Brāh
maṇa apud Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 57, 1; 
60, 1; Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 167;

18, 41 et seq.; Hopkins, Transactions of 
the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 48, n. 1.

किलात
किलात
 is the form of the name 2. Kirāta that appears in the 
Śatapatha, Śāṭyāyanaka, and Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇas.
	1 1) See note^2 under the preceding article.

किलास
किलास
 is the name of a disease, ‘white leprosy,’ in the Athar
vaveda
	1 and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, etc.
	2 It resulted in the 
appearance of grey (palita) and white (śukla, śveta) spots all 
over the skin. Haug gave the same sense to alasa in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 but this is doubtful. The fem. Kilāsī is 
taken by Max Müller to mean a ‘spotted deer’ in one passage 
of the Rigveda.

कीकट
कीकट
 — The name of this people occurs only in one passage 
of the Rigveda, where they appear as hostile to the singer and 
as under the leadership of Pramaganda. Yāska
	2 declares that 
Kīkaṭa was the name of a non-Āryan country, and later
	3 
Kīkaṭa is given as a synonym of Magadha. Hence Zimmer
	4 
concludes that the Kīkaṭas were a non-Āryan people living in 
the country later known as Magadha. Weber
	5 holds that this 
people were located in Magadha, but were Āryan, though at 
variance with other Āryan tribes, perhaps because of heretical 
tendencies, for Magadha was later a seat of Buddhism. But 
the identification is uncertain, and is doubted by Oldenberg
	6 
and Hillebrandt.

of somewhat the same nature as the Surā itself, possibly, as

	3 suggests, a kind of rum. 1) Av. iv. 11, 10; 26, 6; 27, 5;

कुण्डृणाची
 is the name of an animal of unknown character 
occurring in the lists of victims at the horse sacrifice (Aśva
medha) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 The word also occurs in 
one passage of the Rigveda,
	2 in which a bird would seem to be 
intended, though Sāyaṇa interprets it as meaning ‘with 
crooked flight’ (kuṭila-gatyā). In his commentary on the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 he takes the word to denote the house
lizard (gṛha-godhikā). 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 16, 1;

कुत्स
कुत्स
 is the name of a hero frequently mentioned in the 
Rigveda, which, however, gives practically no information 
about him, for he was no doubt already a figure of the mythic 
past. He is several times
	1 called Ārjuneya, ‘descendant of 
Arjuna,’ and is usually
	2 associated with Indra in the exploit of 
defeating the demon Śuṣṇa and winning the sun. He is said
	3 
to have defeated Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus, but, on the 
other hand, he is several times
	4 mentioned with Atithigva and 
Āyu as being vanquished by Indra, his defeat in one passage
	5 
being attributed to Tūrvayāṇa. Elsewhere
	6 he appears with 
Atithigva as a friend of Indra's. In the later literature he is 
seldom
	7 mentioned except in connexion with the myth of his 
binding Indra, which is found in the Brāhmaṇas,
	8 and which is 
based on an obscure verse in the Rigveda.
	9 
The Kutsas, or descendants of Kutsa, are mentioned in one 
hymn of the Rigveda.

कुत्सऔरव
कुत्स औरव
 (‘son of Uru’) is mentioned in the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having murdered his domestic priest 
(purohita), Upagu Sauśravasa, because the father of the latter 
insisted on paying homage to Indra. This fact may be com

passages of the Rigveda.

कुभा
कुभा
 is the name of a river mentioned twice in the Rigveda,
	1 
and no doubt identical with the modern Kabul river, the 
Greek . 1) v. 53, 9; x. 75. 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 200.

कुभ्र
कुभ्र
 is the name of some animal in the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā (ii. 5, 3).

कुमुद
कु-मुद
 is the name of a plant mentioned with other water 
plants in one passage of the Atharvaveda.
	1 It is no doubt the 
white water-lily (Nymphœa esculenta), being the name of that 
plant in post-Vedic Sanskrit also. 1) iv. 34. 5. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70.

कुम्ब
कुम्ब
 is mentioned with Opaśa and Kurīra as an ornament 
of women's hair in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Geldner
	2 thinks that, 
like those two words, it originally meant ‘horn,’ but this is 
very doubtful. Indian tradition
	3 simply regards the term as 
denoting a female adornment connected with the dressing of 
the hair. 1) vi. 138, 3. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 131. 3) Sāyaṇa on Av. vi. 138, 3.

कुम्ब्या
कुम्ब्या
 or Kumvyā is a word mentioned after Ṛc, Yajus, 
Sāman, and Gāthā in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 to denote 
a form of speech. In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	2 it appears as 
one of the forms of measured speech together with Ṛc and 
Gāthā. The precise meaning of the term is unknown. Weber
	3 
suggests the sense ‘refrain.’ 1) xi. 5, 7, 10. 2) ii. 3, 6. 3) Indische Studien, 10, 111, n.

कुम्भ
कुम्भ
 is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda,
	1 
as well as later,
	2 and denotes a ‘pot.’ Usually no doubt made 
of clay, it was easily broken.

कुम्भीनस
कुम्भी-नस
 (‘pot-nosed’) is the name of an animal 
mentioned in the list of victims at the horse sacrifice (Aśva
medha) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
	1 Possibly some sort of 
snake is meant, as in the later literature. 1) v. 5, 14, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; St. Petersburg Dictionary, s. v.

कुयवाच्
कुय-वाच्
 (‘evil-speaking’) appears in one passage of the 
Rigveda
	1 to denote a demon slain by Indra, probably as a 
personification of the barbarian opponents of the Āryans. The 
expression mṛdhra-vāc (‘speaking insultingly’) is similarly used 
of barbarians in the Rigveda.
	2 1) i. 174, 7. 2) v. 29, 10; 32, 8. See Dasyu.

कुरीर
कुरीर,
 like Opaśa and Kumba, denotes some sort of female 
head ornament in the description of the bride's adornment in 
the wedding hymn of the Rigveda
	1 and in the Atharvaveda.
	2 
According to the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	3 the goddess Sinīvālī is 
described by the epithets su-kapardā, su-kurīra, sv-opaśā, as 
wearing a beautiful head-dress. 
According to Geldner,
	4 the word originally meant ‘horn’; 
but this is uncertain, as this sense is not required in any 
passage in which the term occurs.
	5 1) x. 85. 8. 2) vi. 138, 3. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 5, 3:

कुरीरिन्
कुरीरिन्
 (‘having a Kurīra’) is a word occurring in an 
ambiguous passage of the Atharvaveda,
	1 in which it may be 
taken either as a noun meaning a ‘crested animal,’ perhaps as 
Zimmer
	2 suggests the ‘peacock,’ or as an epithet of the word 
Aja, ‘goat,’ in which case it might mean ‘horned.’ But even 
in the latter alternative a metaphorical application of the word 
seems sufficient, just as in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	3 Opaśa 
is used of the horns of cattle, and thus renders unnecessary 
the adoption of Geldner's
	4 view that the original meaning of 
Kurīra is ‘horn.’ 1) v. 31, 2. 2) Altindisches Leben, 91. 3) xiii. 4, 3. 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 130.

कुरु
कुरु
 — The Kurus appear as by far the most important 
people in the Brāhmaṇa literature. There is clear evidence 
that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied Kuru
Pañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed.
	1 The 
Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name 
being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of 
the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pañcālas 
are often expressly referred to as a united nation.
	2 In the land 
of the Kuru-Pañcālas speech is said to have its particular 
home;
	3 the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas is 
proclaimed to be the best;
	4 the Kuru-Pañcāla kings perform 
the Rājasūya or royal sacrifice;
	5 their princes march forth on 
raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season.
	6 Later 
on the Kuru-Pañcāla Brahmins are famous in the Upaniṣads.
	7 
Weber
	8 and Grierson
	9 have sought to find traces in Vedic 
literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar 
seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus 
belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who 
were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pañcālas, who 
were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers 
to the story in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	10 of a dispute between 
Vaka Dālbhya and Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya, the former 
being held to be by origin a Pañcāla, while the latter is held 
to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between 
Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely 
preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a 
priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya 
sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close 
connexion of the two peoples.
	11 Secondly, Weber conjectures 
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	12 that Subhadrikā of Kāmpila was 
the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbour
hood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described 
in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this 
passage by Weber is open to grave doubt;
	13 and in the Kāṇva 
recension of the Saṃhitā
	14 a passage used at the Rājasūya 
shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. More
over, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	15 that 
the old name of the Pañcālas was Krivi. This word looks very 
like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer
	16 plausibly conjectures that 
the Kurus and Krivis formed the Vaikarṇa
	17 of the Rigveda, 
especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the 
Asiknī.
	18 
The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with 
the locality which they occupied, Kurukṣetra, We are told, 
however, of a domestic priest (Purohita) in the service of both 
the Kurus and the Sṛñjayas,
	19 who must therefore at one time 
have been closely connected.
	20 In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 
reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare (aśvā),
	21 
and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm.
	22 
In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony (Vājapeya) of the Kurus is 
mentioned.
	23 There also a curse, which was pronounced on them 
and led to their being driven from Kurukṣetra, is alluded to.
	24 
This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in 
the epic tradition. 
In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as 
a people. But mention is made of a prince, Kuruśravaṇa 
(‘Glory of the Kurus’),
	25 and of a Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa.
	26 
In the Atharvaveda
	27 there occurs as a king of the Kurus 
Parikṣit, whose son, Janamejaya, is mentioned in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	28 as one of the great performers of the horse 
sacrifice. 
It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's
	29 that the Kuru 
people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to 
by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his 
name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called 
Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ who is well known 
as a king of the Pūrus. Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu
Bharatas, who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus, 
later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.
	30 Since the 
Bharatas appear so prominently in the Brāhmaṇa texts as a 
great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them 
in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that 
they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is 
evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the 
Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn 
of the Rigveda
	31 as having kindled fire on the Dṛṣadvatī, the 
Āpayā, and the Sarasvatī — that is to say, in the sacred places 
of the later Kurukṣetra. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī 
(‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the 
Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvatī.
	32 Again, 
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, one Bharata king was 
victorious over the Kāśis,
	33 and another made offerings to 
Gaṅgā and Yamunā,
	34 while raids of the Bharatas against the 
Satvants are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	35 Nor is it 
without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for 
the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	36 
and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice 
the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given 
without any mention of the people over which they ruled, 
while in other cases that information is specifically given.
	37 
The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country (Madhyadeśa).
	38 A group 
of the Kuru people still remained further north — the Uttara 
Kurus beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners — 
that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus — and of the Kuru
Pañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.
	39 There 
seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed 
in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence 
east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vrātya 
Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical 
Āryans) of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	40 and in the fact that in 
the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell 
in the territory of Magadha.
	41 The repeated mention of Kuru
Pañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary 
activity.
	42 
The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it 
probable that they were later immigrants into India than the 
Kosala-Videha or the Kāśis,
	43 who must have been pushed 
into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan 
settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic 
literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of 
the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west. 
It has, however, been conjectured,
	44 mainly on the ground of 
later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the 
Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who, 
coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original 
Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country 
from east to west. Cf. also Kṛtvan. For other Kuru princes 
see Kauravya. 1) For the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,

being northerly (Oldenberg, 395), and

for the puro speech of the north.

berg, Buddha, 9, 391, 398, 399; Lanman, 
Sanskrit Keader, 297, etc. The narra
tive of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 
1, 10 et seq. (Weber, Indische Studien, 
1, 170), rather implies that the Kosala
Videhas are offshoots of the Kuru
Pañcālas, but Oldenberg and Mac
donell (Sanskrit Literature, 214 interpret 
this as referring to the spread of 
Vedic tradition and culture, not of 
nationality. 44) Cf. Grierson, Languages of India, 52 
et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 
1908, 837 et seq. On the other hand, it is 
probably an error to assume that the 
Bharatas were originally situated far 
west of Kurukṣetra, and that the main 
action of the Rigveda was confined to 
the Panjab. When Vasiṣṭha celebrates 
the crossing of the Vipāś and Śutudrī 
(Rv. iii. 33), he probably came from 
the east, as Pischel, Vedische Studien, 
2, 218, points out, and not from the 
west. Adopting the ordinary view, 
Hopkins, India, Old and New, 52, finds 
it necessary to suggest that Yamunā is 
only another name in the Rv. for 
the Paruṣṇī. But the necessity for 
this suggestion, which is not in itself 
plausible, disappears when it is realized 
that the Bharatas held a territory 
roughly corresponding to Kurukṣetra, 
and bounded on the east by the 
Yamunā. On the other hand, Hille
brandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 142, 143. 
places the Kurus near the Ārjīkīyā in 
Kaśmīr, which puts them too far north. 
So also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 103, 
and Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 
12, xlii. It seems probable that the 
Kurus were at a very early period 
widely scattered to the north of the 
Himālaya, in Kurukṣetra, and about 
the Sindhu and Asiknī.

कुरुक्षेत्र
कुरु-क्षेत्र
 (‘land of the Kurus’) is always regarded in the 
Brāhmaṇa texts
	1 as a particularly sacred country. Within its 
boundaries flowed the rivers Dṛṣadvatī and Sarasvatī, as well 
as the Āpayā.
	2 Here, too, was situated Śaryaṇāvant,
	3 which 
appears to have been a lake, like that known to the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa by the name of Anyataḥ-plakṣā.
	4 According to 
Pischel, there was also in Kurukṣetra a stream called Pastyā,
	5 
which he sees in certain passages of the Rigveda. The boun
daries of Kurukṣetra are given in a passage of the Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka
	6 as being Khāṇḍava on the south, the Tūrghna on 
the north, and the Parīṇah on the west. Roughly speaking, it 
corresponded to the modern Sirhind. 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 10;

Sanskrit Literature, 174. Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 12, xli., seems to place 
Kurukṣetra, as lying between the 
Yamunā and Gaṅgā, too far east.

कुरुङ्ग
कुरुङ्ग
 is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as a prince and a 
patron. Ludwig
	2 suggests that he was a king of the Anus, 
but for this theory there seems no good ground. As the 
Turvaśas are mentioned in the same verse, he may possibly 
have been one of their kings. The name suggests a connexion 
with the Kurus, and it may be noted that in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	3 the Turvaśas are connected with the Pañcālas 
(Krivis). 1) viii. 4, 19; Nirukta, vi. 22. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160. 3) xi. 5, 4, 16. See Oldenberg, Buddha,

still alive. His name connects him on the one hand with the 
Kurus, and on the other with Trasadasyu and the Pūrus. 1) x. 33, 4. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 35,

कुल
कुल, कुल-पा
 — As an uncompounded word, Kula does not 
occur before the period of the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 It denotes the 
‘home’ or ‘house of the family,’ and by metonymy the family 
itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pā (lit. ‘house 
protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda
	2 
as inferior to and attendant on the Vrājapati in war, the latter 
being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan. 
In the Atharvaveda
	3 a girl is ironically called Kulapā, because 
she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama 
(the god of death) for a spouse. 
The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of 
individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members 
under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula 
the dwelling is. As distinct from Gotra, Kula seems to mean 
the family in the narrower sense of the members who still 
live in one house, the undivided family. Cf. Gṛha, Grāma, 
Jana, Viś. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 22;

कुल्या
कुल्या
 in two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 according to Muir,
	2 
possibly refers to artificial watercourses flowing into a reservoir 
(hrada). See Avata. 1) iii. 45, 3; x. 43, 7. 2) Sanskrit Texts, 5, 465, 466.

कुवल
कुवल
 is a name of the jujube fruit (Zizyphus jujuba) 
occurring frequently in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and Brāh
maṇas
	2 in connexion with Karkandhu and Badara. See also 
Kola. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2;

कुश
कुश,
 a word later denoting the ‘sacred grass’ (Poa cyno- 
suroides), is taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to mean 
simply ‘grass’ in the passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in 
which it occurs. 
^1) ii. 5, 2, 15; iii. 1, 2, 16; v. 3, 2, 7, 
etc. Kuśā and Kuśī occur in Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 7; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 2, 9; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 10, 1. 2, 7, apparently 
denoting pins of wood or metal, used 
as a mark in a special mode of recita
tion.

कुसर
कु-सर
 is mentioned with Śara and other grasses in one 
hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as affording lurking places for serpents. 1) i. 191, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72.

कुशिक
कुशिक
 is the probably mythical forefather
	1 of the Kuśikas, 
and especially the father of the most important member of 
that family, Viśvāmitra.
	2 The Kuśikas are repeatedly referred 
to in the third Maṇḍala of the Rigveda,
	3 and figure in the 
legend of Śunaḥśepa in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	4 They were 
clearly a family of priests who attached themselves to the 
service of the princes of the Bharatas. They were especially 
devoted to the worship of Indra; hence he is styled Kauśika 
even in the Rigveda.

कुश्रिवाजश्रवस
कुश्रि वाज-श्रवस
 appears as a teacher concerned with the 
lore of the sacred fire in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and in the 
last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	2 
he is mentioned as a pupil of Vājaśravas. It is not clear 
whether he is identical with the Kuśri of the last Vaṃśa of the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka
	3 in the Kāṇva recension, and of the Vaṃśa in 
the tenth book of the Śatapatha,
	4 who is mentioned as a pupil 
of Yajñavacas Rājastambāyana. 1) x. 5, 5. 1. 2) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 3, 
Kāṇva). 3) vi. 5, 4 (Kāṇva only). 4) x. 6, 5, 9. In the Vaṃśas the name 
is accented Kúśri, but in x. 5, 5, 1, as 
Kuśrī; no stress can, however, be laid 
on this. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
1, 70; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 12, xxxiii.

कुषण्ड
कु-षण्ड
 is mentioned with Ṣaṇḍa as a priest at the snake 
festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34; Lāṭyāyana Śranta Sūtra, 
x. 20, 10.

कुषीतक
1. Kuṣītaka denotes, according to the commentary on the 
one passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 in which it is found, 
the sea crow (samudra-kāka) 1) v. 5, 13. 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72.

कुषीतकसामश्रवस
2. Kuṣītaka Sāma-śravasa is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the Gṛhapati, or householder at a sacrificial 
session, of the Kauṣītakis. 1) xvii. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 34.

कुषुम्भक
कुषुम्भक
 seems in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 to mean 
a poisonous insect, Kuṣumbha in th Atharvaveda
	2 clearly 
having the sense of a poison bag. Sāyaṇa renders it as 
‘ichneumon’ (nakula). 1) i. 191, 16. The sense of ‘poison
bag’ is possible in i. 191, 15, and is 
accepted there by Böhtlingk in his 
Dictionary. 2) ii. 32, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 99; Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 
1, 257.

कुष्ठ
1. Kuṣṭha is the name of a plant (Costus speciosus or arabicus)
	1 
which is prominent in the Atharvaveda.
	2 It grew especially on 
the mountains, along with the Soma, on the high peaks of the 
Himālaya (Himavant) where the eagles nest, and was thence 
brought east to men.
	3 Like Soma, it is said to have grown in 
the third heaven under the famous Aśvattha tree, where the 
gods were wont to assemble, and thence it was brought in a 
golden ship.
	4 As a remedy, it held the highest place among 
herbs, being called by the auspicious names Nagha-māra and 
Naghā-riṣa, and styled the offspring of Jīvala and Jīvalā, the 
‘lively’ ones.
	5 It cured headache (śīrṣāmaya), diseases of the 
eyes, bodily affliction,
	6 but especially fever — hence called ‘fever
destroyer’ (takma-nāśana) — and consumption (Yakṣma). From 
its general properties it was also named ‘all-healing’ (viśva- 
bheṣaja).
	7 Its aromatic qualities were apparently known, as it 
is classed with ‘salve’ (Āñjana) and ‘nard’ (Nalada).

कुष्ठ
2. Kuṣṭha. — In one passage of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	1 
there is a series of fractions, Kalā, Kuṣṭha, Śapha, Pad, which 
appear to denote one-sixteenth, one-twelfth, one-eighth, and 
one-fourth respectively. 1) iii. 7, 7. Cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.

कुसीदिन्
कुसीदिन्
 is a designation of the ‘usurer’ found in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Nirukta,
	2 and often in the Sūtras. 
Jolly,
	3 referring doubtless to the expression kusīda apratītta,
	4 ‘a 
loan not yet repaid,’ occurring in connexion with an-ṛṇa, ‘free 
from debt,’ appears to be right in taking Kusīda to have the 
sense of ‘loan’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. The rate of interest 
on loans is not specified before the Sūtra period.

	2 
the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,

कूचक्र
कूचक्र
 is a word occurring only once in an obscure verse 
of the Rigveda,
	1 where Zimmer
	2 suggests that it has the sense 
of the wheel by which water is raised from a well. Much 
more probable is the interpretation of Roth,
	3 who understands 
it to mean the female breast. 1) x. 102, 11. 2) Altindisches Leben, 157. Cf. Geldner,

कूट
कूट,
 a word found in the Rigveda,
	1 the Atharvaveda,
	2 and 
the Brāhmaṇas,
	3 is of doubtful signification. On the whole, 
the most probable sense is hammer,
	4 which suits every passage 
adequately. The St. Petersburg Dictionary renders it ‘horn,’ 
which is the sense accepted by Whitney
	5 for the Atharvaveda 
passage where it occurs. Geldner
	6 thinks that it means ‘trap.’ 1) x. 102, 4. 2) viii. 8, 16. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 24; Śata

कूदी
कूदी,
 written also Kūṭī in the manuscripts, occurs in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and the Kauśika Sūtra
	2 denoting a twig — identi
fied by the scholiast with Badarī, the jujube — which was tied 
to the bodies of the dead to efface their traces, presumably 
in order to render the return of the spirit to the old home 
difficult. 1) v. 19, 12. 2) Bloomfield's edition, xliv. Cf.

कूप
कूप
 occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and later literature
	2 denoting 
an artificial hollow in the earth, or pit. In some cases they 
must have been deep, as Trita in the myth is said to have 
fallen into one from which he could not escape unaided.

Brāhmaṇa (xxvii. 6) denote the pole of a cart.

कूर्च
कूर्च
 is found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 and later
	2 de
noting a bundle of grass used as a seat. In one passage of the

कूशाम्बस्वायवलातव्य
कूशाम्ब स्वायव लातव्य
 is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a priest. His name apparently means
	2 Kūśāmba,
	3 
of the Lātavya clan, son of Svāyu. 1) viii. 6, 8. 2) The form is peculiar, as Kuśāmba 
would be expected. 3) Hopkins, Transactions of the Con-

कृकलास
 denotes the ‘chameleon’ mentioned in the list of

कृकवाकु
कृक-वाकु,
 the ‘cock,’ being named in the Atharvaveda
	1 
with sheep, goats, and other domesticated animals, was pre
sumably tamed.
	2 In the list of victims at the horse sacrifice 
in the Yajurveda,
	3 it appears as dedicated to Savitṛ: Yāska
	4 
explains this by the fact that it declares the time of day 
(kālānuvāda). The commentator Mahīdhara
	5 explains the 
name by tāmra-cūḍa, ‘red-crested.’ It is of course onomato
poetic (‘calling kṛka’).

कृति
कृति
 — From one passage in the Rigveda,
	1 where the Maruts 
are described as having Kṛtis, Zimmer
	2 concludes that the 
word means a dagger used in war. But there is no evidence 
that Kṛti was ever a human weapon. See Asi. 1) i. 168, 3. 2) Altindisches Leben, 301. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 221.

कृत्वन्
कृत्वन्
 — In one passage of the Rigveda
	1 the word Kṛtvan in 
the plural is mentioned with the Ārjīkas and the five peoples. 
Pischel
	2 thinks that it means a people, and Sāyaṇa expressly 
says that the Kṛtvans designate a country.
	3 The name in that 
case would point to some connexion with the Kurus or Krivis. 
Hillebrandt,
	4 however, thinks that the word is an adjective 
which qualifies Ārjīkas and designates this people as magicians, 
being applied to them by an opponent. In favour of this view, 
he quotes Hiouen Thsang's statement
	5 that the neighbouring 
kings held the base Kaśmīrians in such scorn as to refuse all 
alliance with them, and to give them the name of Ki-li-to, or 
Kṛtyas. He suggests that the Ārjīkas settled in Kasmīr in 
ancient times already had the same evil reputation as their 
successors in later days. 1) ix. 65, 23. 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 209. 3) Kṛtvāna iti deśābhidhānam. 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 136, 137 5) Cunningham, Aneient Gevgraphy of

कृमि
कृमि,
 ‘worm.’ In the later Saṃhitās,
	1 and especially in the 
Atharvaveda,
	2 worms play a considerable part. They are 
regarded as poisonous, and are spoken of as found in the 
mountains, in forests, in waters, in plants, and in the human 
body. In accordance with widespread primitive ideas, they 
are considered to be the causes of disease in men and animals. 
The Atharvaveda contains three hymns
	2 as charms directed 
against them. The first of these hymns is of a general character, 
the second is meant to destroy worms in cattle, and the third is 
intended to cure children of worms. When found in men, 
worms are said to have their place in the head and ribs,
	3 and 
to creep into the eyes, nose, and teeth.
	4 They are described as 
dark brown, but white in the fore part of the body, with black 
ears, and as having three heads.
	5 They are given many specific 
names: Alāṇḍu, Ejatka, Kaṣkaṣa, Kīṭa, Kurūru, Nīlaṅgu, 
Yevāṣa, Vaghā, Vṛkṣasarpī, Śaluna, Śavarta, Śipavitnuka,

कृमुक
 is the name in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	1 and the Śata

	2 of a species of wood used for fuel.
	3 1) xix. 10. 2) vi. 6, 2, 11. 3) Ibid. (Krāmuha as applied to

कृश
कृश
 is mentioned with Saṃvarta as a pious sacrificer to 
Indra in one of the Vālakhilya hymns of the Rigveda
	1 and in 
another
	2 as a speaker of truth, while a third is traditionally
	3 
ascribed to his authorship. He seems also to be mentioned 
with Śayu as a protégé of the Aśvins in another hymn of the 
Rigveda,
	4 but here the word may merely denote the ‘feeble 
man.’

कृशन
कृशन,
 ‘pearl.’ In the Rigveda pearls are mentioned as 
adorning the car of Savitṛ
	1 as well as being used for the adorn
ment of a horse.
	2 Hence the horse is spoken of as the ‘pearled 
one’ (kṛśanāvant).
	3 The Atharvaveda
	4 also refers to pearls, and 
mentions that ‘pearl shell’ (śañkhaḥ kṛśanaḥ) won from the sea was 
used as an amulet.
	5 The Nighaṇṭu
	6 renders the word as ‘gold.’ 1) i. 35, 4. 2) x. 68, 1. 3) i. 126, 4. Cf. kṛśanin, vii. 18, 23. 4) x. 1, 7. 5) iv. 10, 1. 3. 6) i. 2. Cf. Sāma Mantra Brāhmaṇa,

कृशानु
कृशानु
 appears in the Rigveda as a mythological personage.
	1 
In one verse,
	2 however, Roth
	3 sees in this word the name of 
a bowman, but there seems no reason to dissociate this passage 
from the rest. 1) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 74, 
112, 137; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mytho- 
logie, 1, 448. 2) i. 112, 21. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 4.

कृषि
कृषि,
 ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt 
known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians, 
as is indicated by the identity of the expressions yavaṃ kṛṣ and 
sasya in the Rigveda with yao karesh and hahya in the Avesta, 
referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain 
which resulted.
	1 But it is not without significance that the 
expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first
	2 and tenth
	3 
books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’ 
books (ii.-vii.).
	4 In the Atharvaveda Pṛthī Vainya is credited 
with the origination of ploughing,
	5 and even in the Rigveda 
the Aśvins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain 
by means of the plough.
	6 In the later Saṃhitās and the 
Brāhmaṇas ploughing is repeatedly referred to.
	7 
Even in the Rigveda
	8 there is clear proof of the importance 
attached to agriculture. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	9 the 
Vrātyas, Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are de
scribed as not cultivating the soil. 
The plough land was called Urvarā or Kṣetra; manure 
(Śakan, Karīṣa) was used, and irrigation was practised (Khani- 
tra). The plough (Lāṅgala, Sīra) was drawn by oxen, teams of 
six, eight, or even twelve being employed.
	10 The operations of 
agriculture are neatly summed up in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	11 
as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ (kṛṣantaḥ, 
vapantaḥ, lunantaḥ, mṛṇantaḥ). The ripe grain was cut with 
a sickle (Dātra, Sṛṇi), bound into bundles
	12 (Parṣa), and beaten 
out on the floor of the granary (Khala).
	13 The grain was then 
separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve (Titau) 
or a winnowing fan (Śūrpa).
	14 The winnower was called 
Dhānyākṛt,
	15 and the grain was measured in a vessel called 
Urdara.
	16 
The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain 
grown, for Yava is a word of doubtful signification, and Dhānā 
is also vague. In the later Saṃhitās
	17 things are different. 
Rice (Vrīhi) appears, Yava means barley, with a species 
styled Upavāka. Beans (Mudga, Māṣa), sesamum (Tila), and 
other grains (Aṇu, Khalva, Godhūma, Nīvāra, Priyaṅgu, 
Masūra, Śyāmāka) are mentioned, while cucumbers (Urvārū, 
Uryārūka) were known. It is uncertain whether fruit trees 
(Vṛkṣa) were cultivated, or merely grew wild;
	18 but frequent 
mention is made of the jujube (Karkandhu, Kuvala, Badara.). 
The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a 
passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā:
	19 barley ripened in summer, 
being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice 
ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains; 
beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains, 
ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two 
harvests (Sasya) a year according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;
	20 
the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April) 
according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.
	21 
The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed 
the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles (Upakvasa, Jabhya, 
Tarda, Pataṅga) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or 
drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains 
spells to prevent these evils.

कृष्टि
कृष्टि
 denotes ‘people’ in general from the Rigveda
	1 onwards. 
Its common and regular use in this sense appears to show that 
the Āryans, when they invaded India, were already agricul
turists, though the employment of the words referring to 
ploughing mentioned under Kṛṣi indicates that not all of the 
people devoted themselves equally to that occupation. Indra 
and Agni are par excellence the lords of men (Kṛṣṭi).
	2 Some
times the word is further defined by the addition of an adjective 
meaning ‘belonging to mankind,’ ‘of men’ (mānuṣīḥ,
	3 mānavīḥ).
	4 
Special mention is frequently
	5 made of the ‘five peoples’ 
(pañca kṛṣṭayaḥ). The exact sense of this expression is doubtful.

कृष्ण
1. Kṛṣṇa (‘black’) denotes a dark-coloured animal or bird. 
In some passages,
	1 as the context shows, an antelope is certainly 
meant. In a few others
	2 a bird of prey seems indicated. See 
also Kṛṣṇājina. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 6, 5; 
vi. 1, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 
4, 1; iii. 2, 1, 28. So kṛṣṇa-viṣāṇā, 
‘horn of the black antelope,’ ibid., 
iii. 2, 1, 18, 28; 2, 20; iv. 4, 5, 2; 
v. 4, 2, 5; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 
3, 7. See also the Aśvamedha passages, 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 17; Vāja

कृष्ण
2. Kṛṣṇa appears as the name of a seer in one hymn of the 
Rigveda.
	1 Tradition assigns to him or to Viśvaka, son of 
Kṛṣṇa (Kārṣṇi), the authorship of the following hymn.
	2 The 
word Kṛṣṇiya may be a patronymic
	3 formed from the same 
name in two other hymns of the Rigveda,
	4 where the Aśvins 
are said to have restored Viṣṇāpū to Viśvaka Kṛṣṇya. In that 
case Kṛṣṇa would seem to be the grandfather of Viṣṇāpū. This 
Kṛṣṇa may be identical with Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa mentioned in the 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.
	5 1) viii. 85, 3. 4. 2) viii. 86. 3) i. 116, 23; 117, 7. 4) As a patronymic, it would be an 
isolated formation (cf. however Pajriya), 
instead of Kārṣṇya. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic 
Grammar, 228a and 200. 5) xxx. 9. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 108; Macdonell, Vedia Myth- 
ology, p. 52.

कृष्णदेवकीपुत्र
3. Kṛṣṇa Devakī-putra is mentioned in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad
	1 as a pupil of the mythical Ghora Āṅgirasa. 
Tradition,
	2 and several modern writers like Grierson, Garbe, 
and von Schroeder, recognize in him the hero Kṛṣṇa, who later 
is deified. In their view he is a Kṣatriya teacher of morals, as 
opposed to Brahminism.
	3 This is extremely doubtful. It 
appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as 
accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of 
Euhemerism. To identify this Kṛṣṇa with the preceding, 
as does the St. Petersburg Dictionary, seems to be quite 
groundless. 1) iii. 17, 6. 2) Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 
169. 3) Von Schroeder, Vienna Oriental 
Journal, 19, 414, 415; Grierson, Encyclo-

4. Kṛṣṇa Hārīta is mentioned as a teacher in the Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka.

parallel passage. 1) iii. 2. 6. 2) viii. 10.

 (‘descendant of Satyaka’) is mentioned

 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned 
in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāh
maṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Śyāmaiajayanta Lauhitya.

कृष्णल
कृष्णल
 denotes the berry of the Abrus precatorius, used as a 
weight according to the later authorities, one Māṣa (‘bean’) 
being equated to four Kṛṣṇalas.
	1 In the sense of a weight it 
occurs in the Taittirīva
	2 and other Saṃhitās,
	3 and later.

kṛṣṇala). 4) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 6, 7; 
Anupada Sūtra, ix. 6. In the later 
language it is also called raktikā or 
guñjā (being a smooth red berry with a 
black spot at one end). 
Cf. Weber's edition of the Jyotiṣa, 82 
et seq.; Indische Strcifen, 1, 102, 103.

कृष्णाजिन
कृष्णाजिन
 is the skin (ajina) of the black antelope (Kṛṣṇa.) 
It is repeatedly referred to in the later Saṃhitās and Brāh
maṇas
	1 with regard to its ritual use. 1) Av. ix. 6, 17; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
ii. 4, 9, 2; v. 4, 4, 4: Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22; 4, 1; 9, 2, 35, 
etc.

कृष्णायस
 (‘black metal’), ‘iron,’ is referred to in the Chān
dogya Upaniṣad (vi. 1, 6). See also Ayas and Kārṣṇāyasa.

कृसर
कृसर,
 a term denoting a mess of rice and sesamum, often 
mentioned in the Sūtras, occurs in the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) v. 2. Cf. Weber, Omina und Portenta, 315 et seq.

केकय
केकय
 is the name of a tribe which in later days, and 
probably also in Vedic times, was settled in the north-west, 
between the Sindhu (Indus) and Vitastā.
	1 In the Vedic texts 
the Kekayas are mentioned indirectly only in the name of their 
prince Aśvapati Kaikeya.
	2 1) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1908, 317, 332. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 6, 1, 2. 
et seq.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 11, 4. 
Cf. Weber, Indian Litenature, 120; Indische Studien, 1, 126.

केतु
1. Ketu is a term which Weber
	1 understands in the sense of 
‘meteor’ or ‘comet’ in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 41. The aruṇāḥ 
ketavaḥ (Av. xi. 10, 1. 2. 7), referred 
to in this sense in the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, are not so treated by 
Böhtlingk in his Dictionary.

केतुवाज्य
2. Ketu Vājya (‘descendant of Vāja’) is mentioned as a 
teacher in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

केवर्त
केवर्त, कैवर्त
 are two variant forms denoting ‘fisher
man’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 and Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 
lists of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice. 1) xxx. 16, with Mahīdhara's note. 2) iii. 4, 12, 1, with Sāyaṇa's note.

केश
केश,
 ‘hair of the head,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the later 
Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.
	1 The hair was a matter of great 
care to the Vedic Indian, and several hymns of the Atharva
veda
	2 are directed to securing its plentiful growth. Cutting 
or shaving (vap) the hair is often referred to.
	3 For a man to 
wear long hair was considered effeminate.
	4 As to modes of 
dressing the hair see Opaśa and Kaparda; as to the beard see 
Śmaśru. 1) Av. v. 19, 3; vi. 136, 3, etc.; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 22; xx. 5; xxv. 3; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 2, 48, etc. 2) vi. 136. 137. Cf. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 68; Bloomfield, Hymns of 
the Atharvaveda, 536, 537. 3) Av. viii. 2, 17; Satapatha Brāh
maṇa, v. 5, 3, 1, etc. Cf. Oldenberg, 
Religion des Veda, 425 et seq. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 2, 
14. But cf. Vincent Smith, Indian 
Antiquary, 34, 203.

केशिन्
1. Keśin is the name of a people occurring in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where their king is mentioned as learning from 
Khaṇḍika the atonement for a bad omen at the sacrifice. 1) xi. 8, 4, 6. Cf. Pānini, vi. 4, 165; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 
131, 134.

केशिन्दार्भ्य
2. Keśin Dārbhya 
	1 or Dālbhya
	2 (‘descendant of Darbha’) is a 
somewhat enigmatic figure. According to the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	3 and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana
	4 he was a king, 
sister's son of Uccaiḥśravas, according to the latter authority. 
His people were the Pañcālas, of whom the Keśins must there
fore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold 
(tryanīka).
	5 A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with 
Ṣaṇḍika in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	6 this appears in another 
form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	3 He was a contemporary 
of a fellow sage, Keśin Sātyakāmi, according to the Maitrā
yaṇī
	7 and Taittirīya
	8 Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	9 
attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh
maṇa
	10 tells how he was taught by a golden bird. 
In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to 
Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator 
is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and 
a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The 
latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā
	11 to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is 
hardly necessary. 1) This is the form of the name in 
the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 
the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh
maṇa; also later in the Bṛhaddevatā. 2) This is the form in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa. It also appears later in the 
Rigveda Anukramaṇī. 3) xi. 8, 4, 1 et seq., as explained by 
Sāyaṇa. 4) iii. 29, 1 et seq. 5) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxx. 2 (Weber 
Indische Studien, 3, 471); Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.; Baudh
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xx. 25. 6) i. 4, 12 (von Schroeder gives no 
variant reading; but ṣ and kh are con
stantly confused in manuscripts). 3) xi. 8, 4, 1 et seq., as explained by 
Sāyaṇa. 7) i. 6, 5. 8) ii. 6, 2, 3. 9) xiii. 10, 8. 10) vii. 4. 11) xxx. 2.

the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 58, 59; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe 
des Ṛgveda, 62, n. 2.

केशिन्सात्यकामि
3. Keśin Sātya-kāmi (‘descendant of Satyakāma’) is men
tioned as a teacher and contemporary of Keśin Dārbhya in 
the Taittirīya (ii. 6, 2, 3) and Maitrāyaṇī (i. 6, 5) Saṃhitās.

केसर-प्राबन्धा
 — In the list of the crimes of the Vaita- 
havyas narrated in the Atharvaveda
	1 is the cooking of the last 
she-goat (caramājām) of Kesaraprābandhā, who may presum
ably be deemed to have been a woman, ‘having braided hair.’
	2 
Ludwig,
	3 followed by Whitney,
	4 appears to amend the passage 
(carama-jām) as meaning ‘the last-born calf’ of Kesaraprā
bandhā, a cow. But this interpretation does not suit the name 
so well. 1) v. 18, 11. 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar-

āraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva).

कोक
1. Koka, a word occurring in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharva
veda,
	2 seems to denote the ‘cuckoo.’ In all the three passages 
in which it is found, Sāyaṇa explains it as the Cakravāka. 
Roth
	3 renders it in the Atharvaveda passages as a certain 
destructive parasitic animal. Cf. Anyavāpa. 1) vii. 104, 22 (koka-yātu, a ghost in 
the shape of a cuckoo). 2) v. 23, 4; viii. 6, 2. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 6.

कोक
2. Koka is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 
4, 17) as a son of the Pañcāla king, Sātrāsāha.

कोकिल
कोकिल,
 a very frequent word in the Epic and later, denoting 
the cuckoo, is only inferred for the Vedic period from its being 
the name of a Rājaputra in the Kāṭhaka Anukramaṇī.

कोश
1. Kośa is the name in the Rigveda
	1 for the ‘bucket’ used in 
drawing water by means of a rope from a well (Avata). In the 
ritual
	2 it denotes a large vessel to hold Soma, as opposed to 
Kalaśa. 1) i. 130, 2; iii. 32, 15; iv. 17, 6. Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 156. 2) Rv. ix. 75. 3; Av. xviii. 4. 30, etc. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 
183 et seq.

कोश
2. Kośa denotes the body of a chariot.
	1 Presumably it was 
fastened to the axles, but it was probably not very secure, as 
the body of Pūṣan's chariot is said not to fall.
	2 The ropes
	3 
used to fasten the Kośa are perhaps referred to in the word 
akṣā-nah.
	4 By synecdoche this word also denotes the whole 
chariot.
	5 See also Vandhura, Ratha. 1) Rv. i. 87, 2; x. 85, 7, etc. 2) Rv. vi. 54, 3. 3) Gāvaḥ, Rv. viii. 48, 5. 4) See under 1. Akṣa. 5) Rv. viii. 20, 8; 22, 9.

कोश
3. Kośa. — The exact sense of this word in Kośa-kārī, the 
designation of a female victim at the Puruṣamedha, or human 
sacrifice,
	1 is uncertain. It may be ‘sheath.’ 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 14; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 10, 1.

कोसल
कोसल
 is the name of a people not occurring in the earliest 
Vedic literature. In the story of the spread of Āryan culture 
told in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 the Kosala-Videhas, as the 
offspring of Videgha Māthava, appear as falling later than the 
Kuru-Pañcālas under the influence of Brahminism. The same 
passage gives the Sadānīrā as the boundary of the two peoples 
 — Kosala and Videha. Elsewhere
	2 the Kausalya, or Kosala 
king, Para Āṭṇāra Hairaṇyanābha, is described as having 
performed the great Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice. Connexion 
with Kāśi and Videha appears also from a passage of the 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.
	3 Weber
	4 points out that Āśvalāyana, 
who was very probably a descendant of Aśvala, the Hotṛ priest 
of Videha, is called a Kosala in the Praśna Upaniṣad.
	5 The 
later distinction of North and South Kosala is unknown to 
both Vedic and Buddhist literature.
	6 
Kosala lay to the north-east of the Ganges, and corresponded 
roughly to the modern Oudh. 1) i. 4, 1, 1 et seq. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 4. 
Cf. Hiraṇya-nābha, a Rājaputra, in 
Praśna Upaniṣad, iii. 2, and Śāṅkhā
yana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 13, as a 
Kausalya, while ibid., 11, Para is styled 
Vaideha. 3) xvi. 29, 5. 4) Indische Studien, 1, 182, 441. 5) vi. 1. 6) Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n.

कौशाम्बेय
 is the patronymic (‘descendant of Kuśāmba’) 
of a teacher Proti in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 according to 
the St. Petersburg Dictionary: a view supported by the fact 
that Kūśāmba actually occurs as the name of a man in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	2 It is, however, possible that the 
word means a ‘native of the town Kauśāmbī’ as understood 
by Harisvāmin in his commentary on the Śatapatha Brāhmana.

क्रतु-विद् जानकि
 (‘descendant of Janaka’) is mentioned in

doctrine regarding Soma from Agni.

क्रय
क्रय,
 ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the 
Rigveda, though the verb krī, from which this noun is derived, 
is found there.
	1 Both noun and verb are common in the later 
Saṃhitās.
	2 Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter 
in the Rigveda:
	3 ten cows are regarded as a possible price for 
an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not 
a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an 
adequate price (śulka) for the purchase of Indra.
	4 The Athar
vaveda
	5 mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments 
(dūrśa), coverlets (pavasta), and goatskins (ajina). The haggling 
of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda,
	6 
and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda
	7 is directed to 
procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called Vasna, and 
the ‘merchant’ Vaṇij. his greed being well known.
	8 
There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency 
having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of 
the standard, the unit was probably the cow.
	9 In a consider
able number of passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	10 and 
elsewhere,
	11 however, the expression hiraṇyaṃ śata-mānam 
suggests that there must have been some standard other than 
cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as 
‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the Kṛṣṇala as a 
measure of weight
	12 suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing 
a hundred Kṛṣṇalas,’ and this seems the more probable explana
tion. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where 
the meaning of the term Manā, which occurs once, is mysterious, 
and where necklets (Niṣka) seem to have been one of the more 
portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and 
may perhaps have served as a means of exchange. 1) iv. 24, 10. 2) Kraya: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1,

क्रवण
क्रवण,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 is 
understood by Ludwig
	2 as the name of the Hotṛ priest or the 
sacrificer. Roth considered it an adjective without at first
	3 
assigning a sense, but afterwards
	4 as meaning ‘timid.’ Sāyaṇa 
interprets it as ‘worshipping.’ Oldenberg
	5 considers the meaning 
uncertain, suggesting as possible ‘the slayer of the victim.’ 1) v. 44. 9. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. 5) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 342.

क्रव्य
क्रव्य,
 ‘raw flesh,’ is never mentioned in Vedic literature 
as eaten by men. Demons alone are spoken of as consuming it,
	1 
apart from Agni being called kravyād, ‘eating raw flesh,’ as 
consumer of the bodies of the dead.
	2 The man who in the 
Rigveda is compelled by starvation to eat dog's flesh, never
theless cooks it.

iv. 16, 1).

क्रिमि
क्रिमि
 See Kṛmi.

क्रिवि
क्रिवि
 is asserted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 to have been 
the older name of the Pañcālas. This statement is supported 
by the name of the king there mentioned, Kraivya Pāñcāla, 
The Krivis appear in the Rigveda
	2 as settled on the Sindhu 
and the Asiknī. It is a plausible conjecture of Zimmer's
	3 that 
with the Kurus they made up the Vaikarṇa people.
	4 The 
importance of the Pañcālas, and the insignificance of the 
Krivis, may be explained in part by the fact that the later 
Kuru-Pañcāla alliance included the Bharatas. It is also 
probable, as Oldenberg
	5 suggests, from the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	6 that the Turvaśas were included in the Pañcālas, and 
as the latter name indicates, probably other tribes also. Or, if 
Hopkins' view
	7 is accepted that Turvaśa was king of the 
Yadus, the latter may in part have been allied with the Krivis 
to form the Pañcālas. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 7. 2) viii. 20, 24; 22, 12. Elsewhere
Krivi is doubtful in sense. In several 
passages (i. 30, 1; viii. 87, 1; ix. 9, 6, 
and perhaps i. 166, 6, where krivir-datī 
is an epithet of lightning) Oldenberg, 
Ṛgveda-Noten, i. 166, 341, understands 
the word to mean ‘horse.’ Elsewhere 
(ii. 17, 6; 22, 2; viii. 51, 8) he takes it 
to be a proper name, while in v. 44, 4, 
he is doubtful. In the passages last 
cited this view may very well be 
correct. 3) Altindisches Leben, 103. 4) Cf. Kavaṣa. 5) Buddha, 404. 6) xiii. 5, 4, 16. 7) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 258 et seq. This view is 
hardly convincing, while the disappear
ance of the Turvaśas is easily to be 
accounted for by their being merged, 
along with the Krivis, in the Pañcālas. 
The name of Krivi is lost in the Epic 
as completely as that of Turvaśa 
(Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1910, 48, notes 4, 5).

 (‘descendant of Vītahotra’) is mentioned 
in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iv. 2, 6) in connexion with the 
Kurus.

क्रुञ्च्
1. Kruñc, 
	1 Kruñca,
	2 Krauñca,
	3 are variant forms denoting 
the ‘curlew’ or ‘snipe.’ To it is attributed in the Yajurveda
	1 
the faculty, later assigned to the Haṃsa, of extracting milk 
from water when the two fluids are mixed.

क्रुन्चाङ्गिरस
2. Krunc Āṅgirasa is in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 the 
name of the seer of a Sāman or Chant called the Krauñca. It 
is doubtless invented to explain the name of the Chant on the 
ordinary principle that Sāmans are called after their authors, 
though this rule has many exceptions.

क्रुमु
क्रुमु
 is the name of a stream mentioned twice in the 
Rigveda — once in the fifth book
	1 and once in the last, in the 
Nadī-stuti, or ‘praise of rivers.’

क्रोष्टृ
 (lit. ‘howler’), the ‘jackal,’ is mentioned in the

क्षत्तृ
क्षत्तृ
 is a word of frequent occurrence in the later Saṃhitās 
and Brāhmaṇas, denoting a member of the royal entourage, 
but the sense is somewhat uncertain. In the Rigveda
	1 it is 
used of a god as the ‘distributor’ of good things to his 
worshippers; the same sense seems to be found in the Athar
vaveda
	2 and elsewhere.
	3 In one passage of the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā
	4 the interpretation ‘doorkeeper’ is given by the com
mentator Mahīdhara, a sense which seems possible in other 
passages,
	5 while Sāyaṇa ascribes to it in one passage of the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	6 the more dignified meaning of antaḥ- 
purādhyakṣa, ‘a chamberlain.’ In other passages,
	7 again, the 
sense of ‘charioteer’ is not unlikely. Later the Kṣattṛ was 
regarded as a man of mixed caste.

क्षत्र
1. Kṣatra, in the general sense of ‘dominion,’ ‘rule,’ ‘power,’ 
as exercised by gods and men, occurs frequently from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards. The word is also found in the concrete 
sense of ‘rulers’ in the Rigveda
	2 and later;
	3 but in no case 
does it in the Rigveda certainly
	4 mean what it regularly denotes 
in the later Saṃhitās,
	5 the ruling class as opposed to the priests 
(Brahman), the subject people (Viś, Vaiśya), and the servile 
class (Śūdra). See also Kṣatriya. A Kṣatra-pati is several 
times mentioned
	6 as an equivalent of ‘king.’ 1) i. 24, 11; 136, 1. 3; iv. 17. 1;

obscure passage of the Rigveda.

क्षत्रविद्या
क्षत्र-विद्या,
 ‘the science of the ruling class,’ is mentioned 
in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.

dhanur-veda, ‘the science of the bow,’ which is the most 
probable sense.

क्षत्रिय
क्षत्रिय
 — As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes, 
intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be 
discussed under Varṇa, this article will be confined to deter
mining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called 
Kṣatriyas, or collectively Kṣatra. 
The evidence of the Jātakas
	1 points to the word Khattiya 
denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led 
the tribes to conquest, as well as those families of the aborigines 
who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite 
of the conquest. In the epic
	2 also the term Kṣatriya seems to 
include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification 
than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals 
and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same 
as the barones of early English history. Neither in the 
Jātakas
	3 nor in the epic
	4 is the term co-extensive with all 
warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who 
are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file. 
In the later Saṃhitās
	5 and the Brāhmaṇas
	6 the Kṣatriya 
stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from 
the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, Brāhmaṇa, 
Vaiśya, and Śūdra. It is significant that Rājanya is a variant 
to Kṣatriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to 
suppose that the Kṣatriya and Rājanya are both of similar 
origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover, 
the early use of Kṣatriya in the Rigveda
	7 is exclusively con
nected with royal authority or divine authority. 
It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be in
cluded in the term Kṣatriya. That it covered the royal house 
and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded 
as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their 
families: this would explain the occasional opposition of 
Rājanya and Kṣatriya, as in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	8 where 
a Rājanya asks a Kṣatriya for a place for sacrifice (deva-yajana). 
Thus, when strictly applied, Kṣatriya would have a wider 
denotation than Rājanya. As a rule, however, the two 
expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in 
what follows. That Kṣatriya ever included the mere fighting 
man has not been proved: in the Rigveda
	9 and later
	10 others 
than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had 
retinues as the kings had, Kṣatriya would embrace those 
retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply 
to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the 
Grāmaṇī was usually a Vaiśya. 
The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very 
close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted
	11 to 
be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king 
(Rājan) and domestic priest (Purohita). Sometimes there was 
feud between Kṣatriya and Brahmin.
	12 His management of the 
sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Kṣatriya by 
embroiling him with the people
	13 or with other Kṣatriyas.
	14 
Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Kṣa
triya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority.
	15 
There are, however, references to occasional feuds between 
the people and the nobles,
	16 in which no doubt the inferior 
numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms 
and prowess. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	17 the Vaiśya is 
described as tributary to another (anyasya bali-kṛt), to be 
devoured by another (anyasyādya), and to be oppressed at will 
(yathākāma-jyeya). Probably these epithets apply most strictly 
to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage 
shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles. 
No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have 
been hereditary, to be supported by the common people, 
whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these 
privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to 
perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an 
obscure passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	18 
The main duty of the Kṣatriya in the small states
	19 of the 
Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his 
special attribute,
	20 just as the goad is that of the agriculturist; 
for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the 
Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is 
uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Brāhmaṇa literature 
there are references to learned princes like Janaka of Videha, 
who is said to have become a Brahmin (brahmā), apparently in 
the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin 
possessed.
	21 Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were 
Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,
	22 Aśvapati Kaikeya,
	23 and Ajātaśatru.
	24 
Garbe,
	25 Grierson,
	26 and others believe they are justified in 
holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special 
philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which 
appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there 
is clear evidence
	27 that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics 
were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to 
attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece 
of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages (rājan- 
yarṣi),
	28 but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on 
them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa.
	29 
Again, the Nirukta
	30 gives a tradition relating how Devāpi, 
a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother 
Śaṃtanu; but it is very doubtful if the story can really be 
traced with Sieg
	31 in the Rigveda
	32 itself. In any case, the 
stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank, 
while there is no evidence that the average Kṣatriya was 
concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any 
reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade 
or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of 
administration and war were adequate to absorb his atten
tion. On the other hand, we do hear of a Rājanya 
as a lute player and singer at the Aśvamedha or horse 
sacrifice.
	33 
Of the training and education of a Kṣatriya we have no 
record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was 
mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and 
the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve 
on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility 
which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably 
not unusual or impossible for a Vaiśya to become a Kṣatriya; 
at least, this assumption best explains the phrase
	34 ‘claiming 
falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ (kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam). 
The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly 
close relation. The former being the Kṣatriya par excellence, 
it is to him rather than to the ordinary Kṣatriya that we must 
refer passages like that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	35 where it 
is said that the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clansmen, 
gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found 
among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of 
the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same 
Brāhmaṇa
	36 it is said that a Kṣatriya consecrates a Kṣatriya, a 
clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of 
the old king consecrating the prince (kumāra) who is to succeed 
him; and again,
	37 the Kṣatriya and the Purohita are regarded 
as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel 
with the Purohita here suggesting that the Kṣatriya par excellence 
is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes con
trasted with the Rājanya.
	38 
The Sūtra literature contains elaborate rules
	39 for the educa 
tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot 
always be traced in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and their value is 
questionable. 1)See Fick, Die sociale Gliederung im

xxiv. 18, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xx. 1. 9) In the following passages there is 
reference to the people (viś) fighting: 
i. 69, 3; 126, 5 (cf., however, Pischel, 
Vedische Studien, 2, 121); iv. 24, 4; 
vi. 26, 1; vii. 79, 2; viii. 18, 18; 96, 15; 
probably also vii. 33, 6, where the 
Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ means ‘the subjects of 
the Tṛtsu princes,’ as Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 136, thinks. In vi. 41, 5, on 
the other hand, the people and wars 
(pṛtanāsu) are contrasted, the normal 
rule of the common folk being peace. 10) In Av. ix. 7, 9, the people are 
clearly designated as balam, or ‘force,’ 
a regular term later for an armed force. 
The later law books (e.g., Gautama, 
vii. 6; Vasiṣṭha, ii. 22) allow even 
Brahmins to maintain themselves by 
the occupation of Kṣatriyas in case of 
need. For the Epic, cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 
94, 95; 184 et seq. 11) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 10, 3;

Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 7; iii. 5, 2, 11; 6, 1, 
17; vi. 6, 3, 14. The superiority of 
the Rājanya to all other castes is 
asserted in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 
10, 1, etc. The superiority of the 
Brahmin to the Kṣatriya is sometimes 
asserted — e.g., in the Atharvaveda 
hymns, v. 18. 19; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
iv. 3, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 9, 1; 
3, 7, 8. So the Rājasūya sacrifice of 
the king is inferior to the highest 
sacrifice (the Vājapeya) of the priest 
(ibid., v. 1, 1, 12), and though the 
Brahmin goes after the king, he is yet 
stronger than he (v. 4, 2, 7, and v. 4, 
4, 15). Cf. Hopkins, op. cit., 76. 12) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5; Av.

क्षपावन्
क्ष-पावन्,
 ‘protector of the earth,’
	1 is an epithet of a king,
	2 
or denotes a king
	3 in the Rigveda. The word is significant, as 
showing the function of the king as the protector of the tribal 
territory. 1) The word occurs only in the 
nominative singular as kṣapāvān, which 
would be the regular form from a stem 
kṣapāvant; but it is probably an irregu
larity for kṣapāvā. Cf. Oldenberg. 
Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 72. 2) iii. 55, 17. 3) i. 70, 5; vii. 10, 5; viii. 71, 2; 
x. 29, 1. 
Cf. kṣiti-pa, ‘guardian of earth,’ 
‘king,’ in later Sanskrit.

क्षिति
क्षिति
 is in the Rigveda
	1 a regular word for ‘dwelling,’ and in 
particular the kṣitir dhruvā, ‘the secure dwelling,’ is mentioned
	2 
in a context that shows it, to be equivalent to the Vṛjana or 
Grāma regarded as a stronghold. From this sense is developed 
that of the peoples occupying the settlements,
	3 and in particular 
the five peoples
	4 (for whom see Pañca Janāsaḥ). 1) i. 65, 3; iii. 13, 4; v. 37. 4, 
etc. 2) i. 73, 4 (cf. 2); vii. 88, 7. See

vii. 75, 4; 79, 1.

क्षिप्त
क्षिप्त,
 ‘a wound’ (caused by shooting), or ‘bruise’ (caused 
by throwing), is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	1 together with 
a remedy for it, the Pippalī. 1) vi. 109, 1. 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 389.

क्षिप्रश्येन
क्षिप्र-श्येन,
 ‘swift falcon,’ is the name of a bird in the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 14, 11) and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
x. 5, 2, 10).

क्षीर
क्षीर,
 ‘milk,’ also called Go or Payas, played a large part in 
the economy of the Vedic Indians.
	1 It was taken warm (pakva 
as it came from the cow,
	2 or was used with grain to make a 
‘mess cooked with milk’ (kṣīra-pākam odanam).
	3 It was also 
used for mixing with Soma (Abhiśrī, Āśir). From it butter 
(Ghṛta) was made. Milk was also curdled, the Pūtīkā and 
Kvala plants, among others, being used for the purpose.
	4 The 
curdled milk (Dadhi) was undoubtedly used for food; and a 
kind of cheese is perhaps referred to in one passage of the 
Rigveda.
	5 Goat's milk (aja-kṣīra) is also mentioned.
	6 1) The word kṣīra does not occur in 
Rv. ii. vii. It is found in i. 109, 3; 
164, 7; viii. 2, 9; ix. 67, 32; x. 87, 
16 (= Av. viii. 3, 15). See Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society,

Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63,

क्षीरौदन
क्षीरौदन,
 ‘rice cooked with milk,’ is mentioned frequently 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 5, 3, 4; xi. 5, 7, 5, etc.).

क्षुद्रसूक्तस्
क्षुद्र-सूक्तस्,
 ‘makers of short hymns,’ is the name given 
in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	1 to the authors of certain hymns of 
the Rigveda. Cf. Mahāsūkta. 1) ii. 2, 2. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 212, and Macdonell, Bṛhaddevatā. 
notes on iii. 116.

क्षुम्प
क्षुम्प
 is a word occurring only in one passage of the 
Rigveda,
	1 where it seems to mean a ‘bush.’ The Nirukta
	2 
identifies it with the Ahichatraka, a ‘mushroom.’ 1) i. 84, 8. 2) v. 16. Cf. Benfey, Sāmaveda, Glossar, 53.

क्षुर
क्षुर
 occurs three times in the Rigveda. The word appears 
to have the general sense of ‘blade’
	1 in one passage,
	2 possibly 
also in another,
	3 where it is said that the hare swallowed a 
Kṣura, and where the sense ‘blade’ is adequate. In the third 
passage
	4 there seems to be a reference to the sharpening of a 
razor on a grindstone
	5 (bhurijos, the dual denoting precisely, as 
Pischel
	6 points out, the two sides of the apparatus, between 
which the stone revolved like the modern grindstone). But 
Muir,
	7 following another view of Roth,
	8 adopts the sense ‘the 
edge of scissors,’ which, however, hardly suits the other 
passage, one in the Atharvaveda,
	9 where a Kṣura is described 
as moving about on the bhurijos,
	10 as the tongue on the lip. The 
meaning ‘razor’ is perfectly clear in the Atharvaveda,
	11 where 
shaving by means of it is mentioned; in many other passages
	12 
either sense is adequate. A kṣuro bhṛjvān occurs in the Yajur
veda:
	13 it seems to denote, as Bloomfield
	14 suggests, a razor 
with a strop (in the shape of a small grinding apparatus). 
Kṣura-dhārā
	15 denotes ‘the edge of a razor,’ like kṣurasya 
dhārā.
	16 In the Upaniṣads
	17 a razor-case (Kṣura-dhāna) is 
mentioned. See also Śmaśru. 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 17, 61, 69. Cf. 13, 292 
(as ‘knife’ in the Epic). 2) i. 166, 10 (paviṣu kṣurāḥ on the 
fellies of the Maruts' car; possibly 
‘razors’ may be meant, as Max Müller 
says in his note on this passage, Sacred 
Books of the East, 32, 235, n. 4). 3) x. 28, 9, where Sāyaṇa renders it 
as meaning ‘having claws.’ The later 
tradition ascribes the swallowing to a 
goat. 4) viii. 4, 16 (saṃ naḥ śiśīhi bhurijor 
iva kṣuram, ‘sharpen us like a razor on 
a grindstone or stropping apparatus’). 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary,

क्षेत्र
क्षेत्र,
 ‘field.’ The use of this word in the Rigveda points 
clearly to the existence of separate fields
	1 carefully measured 
off,
	2 though in some passages the meaning is less definite, 
indicating cultivated land generally.
	3 In the Atharvaveda
	4 and 
later the sense of a separate field is clearly marked, though the 
more general use is also found.
	5 The deity Kṣetrasya Pati,
	6 
‘Lord of the Field,’ should probably be understood as the god 
presiding over each field, just as Vāstoṣ Pati presides over each 
dwelling.
	7 It is a fair conclusion from the evidence that the 
system of separate holdings already existed in early Vedic 
times.^8 See also Urvarā, Khilya. 1) x. 33, 6. Cf. iii. 31, 15; v. 62, 7. 2) i. 110, 5. 3) i. 100, 18; ix. 85, 4; 91, 6; Kṣetra- 
jeṣa, i. 33, 15, ‘acquisition of land’; 
kṣetrā-sā, iv. 38, 1, ‘gaining land’; 
kṣetraṃ-jaya, ‘conquering cultivated 
land,’ Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11. 
The wider sense of ‘place’ also occurs, 
v. 2, 3; 45, 9; vi. 47, 20, etc., and 
often later. 4) iv. 18, 5; v. 31, 4; x. 1, 18; xi. 1, 
22; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 2;

tress of the Field,’ 12, 1; kṣetrāṇāṃ 
patiḥ, ‘Lord of Fields,’ Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xvi. 18. 7) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 138. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 236; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 1, 8, where 
the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the 
people, gives a settlement to a man: 
that is, presumably assigns to him a 
definite Kṣetra for his own, probably 
measured out as recorded in Rv. 
i. 110, 5.

क्षेत्रिय
क्षेत्रिय
 is a disease which is mentioned several times in the 
Atharvaveda, and against which three hymns are specially 
directed.
	1 It is also mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	2 and 
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 The commentators on the Athar
vaveda agree in taking it to be a hereditary disease. The word 
may mean ‘organic,’
	4 or possibly ‘produced in the field,’ as a 
theory of its origin. What disease is really intended is quite 
uncertain. Weber
	5 considered that the aim of the Atharvan 
hymns was to drive away injury threatening the fields, but this 
is improbable. Bloomfield
	6 suggests ‘scrofula’ or ‘syphilis.’ 
The remedies mentioned throw no light on the symptoms. 1) ii. 8. 10; iii. 7. Cf. ii. 14, 5; 
iv. 18, 7. 2) xv. 1. 3) ii. 5, 6, 1-3, where the form is 
Kṣetrī, explained as a demon causing 
illness, merely an incorrect version of 
Av. iii. 10. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 5) Indische Studien, 5, 145; 13, 150

क्षेमधृत्वन्पौण्डरीक
क्षेम-धृत्वन् पौण्डरीक
 (‘descendant of Puṇḍarīka’) is 
mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having sacrificed 
on the bank of the river Sudāman. 1) xxii. 18, 7. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 32. Later, the name is 
Kṣema-dhanvan, Harivaṃśa, 824, etc.

क्षैमि
क्षैमि,
 ‘descendant of Kṣema,’ is the patronymic of Suda- 
kṣiṇa in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 6, 3; 7, 1, etc.; 
8, 6).

क्षोणी
क्षोणी
 — This word, when used in the plural, denotes, 
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary and Ludwig,
	1 in 
several passages of the Rigveda,
	2 the free retainers of the king. 
Geldner
	3 at one time thought it referred to the wives of the 
king, pointing to polygamy; but later
	4 he concluded that it 
means certain divine wives. 1)Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 247. 2) i. 57, 4; 173, 7; viii. 3, 10; 13, 17;

sense is doubtful. 3) Bezzenberger, Beiträge, 11, 327. 4) Vedische Studien, 1, 279, 283.

क्षौम
क्षौम,
 ‘a linen garment,’ is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā (iii. 6, 7, etc.) and in the Sūtras.

क्ष्विङ्का
क्ष्विङ्का
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda
	1 as a bird of prey. 
The word also occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, 
or horse sacrifice, in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	2 where the com
mentary absurdly explains it as ‘a red-mouthed female ape’ 
(rakta-mukhī vānarī). 1) x. 87, 7. 2) v. 5, 15, 1. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

ख
ख
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 the hole in the nave 
of the wheel in which the axle is inserted. There was a 
difference, it seems, in the size of the hole in the wheel of 
a cart (Anas) and of a chariot (Ratha).
	3 See also 1. Yuga. 1) Rv. viii. 77, 3; 91, 7; x. 156, 3,

‘agreeable.’ 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, v. 12, 1

खङ्ग
खङ्ग
 See Khaḍga.

खड्ग
खड्ग
 is the reading in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	1 of the 
name of an animal which, in the text of the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	2 variously appears as Khaṅga and Khaḍga. The 
rhinoceros seems clearly to be meant.
	3 In the Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra
	4 a rhinoceros hide is mentioned as the covering of 
a chariot. 1) iii. 14, 21. 2) xxiv. 40. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86. 4) xiv. 33, 26 (khāḍga-kavaca aśvaratha)

खण्डिकऔद्भारि
खण्डिक औद्भारि
 (‘descendant of Udbhāra’) is mentioned 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a teacher of Keśin, and in the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	2 as having been defeated by Keśin as a 
sacrificer. A Khāṇḍika appears in the Baudhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	3 as an enemy of Keśin. 1) xi. 8, 4, 1. 2) i. 4, 12, where Ṣaṇḍika is the read
ing of the MSS. 3) Caland, Über das rituelle Sūtra des

खदिर
खदिर
 is mentioned frequently from the Rigveda
	1 onwards
	2 
as a tree with hard wood
	3 — the Acacia catechu. The Aśvattha 
is referred to as engrafting itself upon it in the Atharvaveda,
	4 
and from it the climbing plant Arundhatī is said to have sprung.
	5 
The sruva or sacrificial ladle is spoken of as having been made 
from it,
	6 no doubt because of its hardness. It is in the same 
passage also said to have sprung from the sap (rasa) of the 
Gāyatrī. There is no clear reference to Catechu having been 
prepared from its core,
	7 as it was later. The core (sāra) was 
used for making amulets.

खद्योत
ख-द्योत
 (‘sky-illuminator’), ‘the firefly,’ is mentioned in 
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vi. 7, 3. 5).

खनित्र
खनित्र,
 a ‘shovel’ or ‘spade’ for digging, is mentioned in 
the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) i. 179, 6 (possibly metaphorical: 
see Oldenberg. Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 172; 
the passage is obscure). 2) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 2, 4, 
etc.

खनित्रिम
खनित्रिम,
 ‘produced by digging,’ as an epithet of āpaḥ, 
‘waters,’ clearly refers to artificial water channels used for 
irrigation, as practised in the times of the Rigveda
	1 and the 
Atharvaveda.

खर,
 ‘ass,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka,
	1 where 
a team of asses is alluded to. Probably the passages in the

earth mound on which the sacrificial vessels were placed, pre
suppose the sense of ‘ass,’ the mound being shaped in this 
form.

खर्गला
खर्गला
 is an ‘owl’ or other nocturnal bird mentioned in 
one passage of the Rigveda.

खर्जूर
खर्जूर
 is the name of a tree (Phœnix silvestris) which is 
mentioned in the Yajurveda.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 9, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 10; xxxvi. 7. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 63.

खल
खल,
 the ‘threshing-floor,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and the Atharvaveda.
	2 See Kṛṣi. 1) x. 48, 7; Nirukta, iii. 10. 2) xi. 3, 9; khala-ja, ‘produced on a 
threshing-floor,’ viii. 6, 15; khalya,

Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 6. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238.

खलकुल
खल-कुल
 is a word occurring in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad,
	1 where Sāyaṇa glosses it by Kulattha, a kind of 
pulse (Dolichos uniflorus). 1) vi. 3. 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 13 Kāṇva). Cf. Weber, Indische Studien 
1, 355.

खल्व
खल्व
 is some sort of grain or leguminous plant, perhaps, as 
Weber
	1 thinks, the Phaselus radiatus. It is mentioned with 
other grains of all sorts in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	2 and as 
being crushed with the Dṛṣad in the Atharvaveda.
	3 It occurs 
also in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	4 where Śaṅkara glosses 
it with niṣpāva. 1) Indische Studien, 1, 355. 2) xviii. 12, where Mahīdhara glosses 
it by caṇaka, ‘chick-pea.’ 3) ii. 31. 1; v. 23, 8. 4) vi. 3. 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 3, 
13 Kāṇva). 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241.

खाण्डव
खाण्डव
 is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	1 as one 
of the boundaries of Kurukṣetra. There seems no reason to 
doubt its identity with the famous Khāṇḍava forest of the 
Mahābhārata. The name occurs also in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 and the Śāṭyāyanaka.
	3 1) v. 1, 1. 2) xxv. 3, 6. 3) Max Müller, Ṛgveda, ^2 iv. ci. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78.

खादि
खादि
 occurs frequently in the Rigveda denoting either 
anklets
	1 or armlets,
	2 or sometimes rings on the hands.
	3 
Max Müller
	4 considers that the word means quoits, the later 
Cakra.
	5 The rings were sometimes of gold.
	6 1) v. 54, 11, and perhaps 53, 4. 2) This is what Khādis on the 
shoulders must mean, i. 166, 9; vii. 56, 13. 3) i. 168, 3; khādi-hasta, ‘with rings 
on the hands,’ 5, 58, 2. So Roth takes 
Khādin in vi. 16, 40; St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v. Khādin occurs also in 
ii. 34, 2; x. 38, 1. 4) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 120, 
230. 5) Cf. vṛṣa-khādi, Rv. i. 64, 10. 6) Hiraṇya-khādi, Śāṅkhāyana Śranta

खारी
खारी
 designates a measure of Soma in one passage of the 
Rigveda.
	1 1) iv. 32, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 280.

खार्गलि
खार्गलि,
 ‘descendant of Khargalā or Khṛgala,’ is the 
metronymic or patronymic of Luśākapi.
	1 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxx. 2; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 4, 3.

खिल
1. Khila, 
	1 Khilya
	2 appear to have the same meaning. 
According to Roth,
	3 these terms denote the waste land lying 
between cultivated fields; but he admits that this sense does 
not suit the passage of the Rigveda
	4 in which it is said that 
the god places the worshipper on an unbroken Khilya (abhinne 
khilye), and he accordingly conjectures the reading akhilya- 
bhinne, ‘land unbroken by barren strips.’ Pischel
	5 thinks that 
the meaning intended is broad lands, which were used for the 
pasturing of the cattle of the community, and were not broken 
up by cultivated fields. Oldenberg,
	6 however, points out that 
the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields, 
but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as 
Roth thought. This agrees with the fact that in Vedic 
times separate fields were already known: see Kṣetra. 1) Av. vii. 115, 4; Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, viii. 3, 4, 1. 2) Rv. vi. 28, 2; x. 142, 3. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. So

Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 
3, 499; Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiutic 
Society, 1910, 228.

खिल
2. Khila as a designation of certain hymns appended to the 
received text of the Rigveda occurs only in the Sūtra period.
	1 
The term is a metaphorical application of the preceding word, 
‘a space not filled up,’ ‘a supplement.’ 1) See Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 16 et seq.

खृगल
खृगल,
 or, as the Paippalāda recension of the Atharvaveda
	1 
has it, Khugila, is an obscure expression found in two passages 
only — once in the Rigveda,
	2 and once in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
In the former the meaning ‘crutch’ seems required; in the 
latter Sāyaṇa glosses it by ‘armour’ (tanu-trāṇa), but the sense 
is quite uncertain. 1) iii. 9. 3. 2) ii. 39, 4. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 340; Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 98. 1) iii. 9. 3.

खेल
खेल
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where Pischel
	2 
considers that a god, Vivasvant, is meant, and that races were 
run in his honour, explaining thus the phrase ājā khelasya, as 
‘in the race of Khela.’ Roth
	3 thinks that a man is meant, 
and Sieg,
	4 following Sāyaṇa, sees in him a king whose Purohita 
was Agastya. See also Aṃśu. 1) i. 116, 15. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 171-173. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 127, 128. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 4. 28.

गङ्गा
गङ्गा,
 the modern Ganges, is mentioned directly in the 
Rigveda only once, in the Nadī-stuti or ‘Praise of Rivers.’
	1 
But it is also referred to in the derivative form gāṅgyaḥ as an 
epithet of Urukakṣa.
	3 The name of this river does not occur 
	2 
in the other Saṃhitā, but appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	4 
where victories of Bharata Dauḥṣanti on both Gaṅgā and 
Yamunā are referred to, and in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	5 
especial honour is assigned to those who dwell between the 
Gaṅgā and the Yamunā, this being. To doubt, the region in 
which that text originated. The identification of the Gaṅgā 
with the Apayā
	6 made by Ludwig
	7 must be rejected: see 
Āpayā. 1) x. 75, 5. 3) The reference to the Gaṅgā re
mains, even if with Oldenberg (Ṛgveda- 
Noten, 1, 396) we assume that a thicket 
i meant, and not a proper name 
(cf. Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 
2, 288). See also Weber, Proceed
ings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 563, 
n. 1. 2) vi. 45, 31. 4) xiii. 5, 4, 11. The victory on the 
Gaṅgā represents the farthest extent 
of Bharata or Kuru rule. Cf. Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, viii. 23, and a verse in the 
Vaitāna Sūtra, xxxiv. 9, where the 
Sarasvatī is also referred to. 5) ii. 20. 6) Rv. iii. 23, 4. 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
200. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
4. 5.

गज
गज,
 the common name of the elephant in Epic
	1 and later 
Sanskrit, is only found in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa.
	2 See 
Hastin. 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 265, 269. 2) Indische Studien, 1, 39.

गणक
गणक,
 ‘an astrologer,’ occurs in the list of victims at the 
Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice, in the Yajurveda.
	1 See 
also Nakṣatradarśa. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. Weber.

गन्धर्वायणबालेय
गन्धर्वायण बालेय
 (‘descendant of Bali’) Āgniveśya is 
mentioned as a Pañcāla in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xx. 25).

गन्धार
गन्धार
 is a later form of the name of the people called 
Gandhāri in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda. In the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad
	1 the Gandhāras are referred to as being distant from 
the writer. See also Gāndhāra. 1) vi. 14, 1. 2. See Oldenberg, Buddha, 
399, n.; Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 
219, n. On the other hand, Max Müller, 
Sacred Books of the East, 15. 106, thought 
the passage meant that the Gandhāras 
were near the writer.

गन्धारि
गन्धारि
 is the name of a people in the north-west of India. 
In the Rigveda
	1 the good wool of the sheep of the Gandhāris 
is referred to. The Gandhāris are also mentioned with the 
Mūjavants, Angas, and Magadhas in the Atharvaveda.
	2 
Gandhāris
	3 or Gāndhāris
	4 are also spoken of in the Śrauta 
Sūtras.
	5 Zimmer
	6 considers that they were settled in Vedic 
times on the south bank of the Kubhā up to its mouth in the 
Indus, and for some distance down the east side of the Indus 
itself. They later formed a portion of the Persian empire, 
and detachments of Gandarians accompanied Xerxes in his 
expedition against Greece.
	7 1) i. 126, 7. 2) v. 22, 14. The latter two tribes 
are apparently the Eastern limit of 
the poet's knowledge, the two former 
the Northern. 3) Hiraṇyakeśi Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 6; 
Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 6, 18. 4) Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxi. 13. 5) See Caland, Zeitschrift der Deutschen

गभस्ति
गभस्ति
 denotes, according to Roth,
	1 the pole of a chariot 
in the epithet syūma-gabhasti, ‘having reins as a pole,’ used of 
the car of the gods in the Rigveda,
	2 and independently in the 
plural in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 The meaning is, however, 
doubtful.
	4 Roth
	5 himself suggests that syūma-gabhasti may 
refer to a sort of double reins. 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) i. 122, 5; vii. 71, 3. 3) ii. 7, 13, 4. 4) See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 
55. 5) Op. cit., s.v.

गय
1. Gaya, ‘house,’ is a common word in the Rigveda,
	1 and 
sometimes occurs later.
	2 As its sense includes the inmates as 
well as their belongings, it is equivalent to ‘household.’ 1) i. 74, 2; v. 10, 3; 44, 7; vi. 2, 8, 
etc. 2) Av. vi. 3, 3; 84, 1; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xxvii. 3.

गयप्लात
2. Gaya Plāta (‘son of Plati’) is referred to in the Rigveda,
	1 
two hymns of which he clearly claims to have composed, and 
which are attributed to him in the Sarvānukramaṇī and the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the Atharvaveda
	3 he appears with 
Asita and Kaśyapa as a half-mythical magician.
	4 1) x. 63, 17; 64, 17 (as son of Plati). 2) v. 2. 3) i. 14, 4. Cf. also the Khila after 
Rv. v. 51, 15; Indische Studien, 3, 
214. 4) Bloomfield, American Journal of 
Philology, 17, 403. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 133; Weber, Indische Studien, 
3, 460.

गर
1. Gara, ‘poison,’ is referred to in the Atharvaveda
	1 in the 
compound gara-gīrṇa, ‘poisoned.’ In the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	2 it means simply a ‘fluid.’ 1) v. 18, 13. Cf. gara alone, Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 4, 2 (see Indische 
Studien, 1, 33); Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, i. 9, 
10; gara-gir, ‘poisoned,’ Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 1, 9; xix. 4, 2. 10. 2) xi. 5, 8, 6.

गर
2. Gara is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the 
author of a Sāman or Chant, and as a friend of Indra. 1) ix. 2, 16. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 52.

गर्ग
गर्ग
 is the name of a sage who is not mentioned in any of 
the Saṃhitās,
	1 but his descendants, the Gargāḥ Prāvareyāḥ, 
are referred to in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	2 Garga himself does 
not occur till the Sūtra period.
	3 1) The authorship of Rv. vi. 47 is 
attributed to Garga Bhāradvāja in the 
Anukramaṇī. 2) xiii. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
3, 374. 3) Garga-trirātra, Garga-tryaha, a 
three-night or three-day feast of Garga. 
See Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 2; 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 22. 2; 
Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxiii. 2, 8.

गर्गर
गर्गर,
 apparently the designation of a musical instrument, 
is mentioned once in the Rigveda.
	1 1) viii. 69, 9. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n. 1; Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 289.

गर्त
गर्त
 in the Rigveda
	1 primarily denotes the seat of the chariot 
on which the archer sat. It seems to have been of considerable 
size, being described as bṛhant,
	2 ‘large.’ The word then comes 
to denote the chariot
	3 itself, either really or metaphorically.
	4 1) vi. 20, 9. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
246, 247. Zimmer wrongly takes this 
passage to refer to standing in the car. 
See Hopkins. Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 238, 239; Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 3, 48, and cf. garta-sad, 
‘sitting on the car seat,’ in Rv. ii. 33. 
11. 2) v. 62, 8; 68, 5. 3) So probably in v. 62, 5; gartā-ruh, 
‘mounting the chariot,’ in Rv. i. 124, 7; 
Nirukta, iii. 5, may refer merely to 
mounting the seat. The passage is 
obscure; see Geldner, Rigveda, Kom- 
mentar, 22. 4) vii. 64, 4 (of the hymn).

गर्दभ
गर्दभ,
 ‘the ass,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as inferior 
to the horse. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā he again appears as 
inferior to the horse,
	2 but at the same time as the best bearer 
of burdens (bhāra-bhāritama) among animals.
	3 The same 
authority styles the ass dvi-retas, ‘having double seed,’
	4 in 
allusion to his breeding with the mare as well as the she-ass. 
The smallness of the young of the ass, and his capacity for 
eating, are both referred to.
	5 The disagreeable cry of the 
animal is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	6 and in allusion to 
this the term ‘ass’ is applied opprobriously to a singer in the 
Rigveda.
	7 A hundred asses are spoken of as a gift to a singer 
in a Vālakhilya hymn.
	8 The mule (aśvatara) is the offspring of 
an ass and a mare, the latter, like the ass, being called dvi- 
retas,
	9 ‘receiving double seed,’ for similar reasons. The male 
ass is often also termed Rāsabha. The female ass, Gardabhī, 
is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	10 and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad.
	11 1) iii. 53, 23. A car drawn by asses 
is referred to in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa, iv. 9; see also Khara. 2) v. 1, 2, 1. 2. 3) v. 1, 5, 5. 4) v. 1, 5, 5; vii. 1, 1, 2; Jaiminīya

Brāhmaṇa.

गर्दभीविपीत
गर्दभी-विपीत,
 or Gardabhī-vibhīta, is the name of a 
teacher who was a Bhāradvāja and a contemporary of Janaka, 
mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 
1) iv. 1, 11 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 1, 5 Kāṇva).

गर्मुत्
गर्मुत्
 is the name of a kind of wild bean mentioned in the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
	1 The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	2 has the form 
Ganmut, which is probably a false reading. The adjective 
gārmuta, ‘made from the Garmut bean,’ is found in the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.

गवय
गवय,
 the name of a species of ox (Bos gavacus) occurs 
frequently from the Rigveda

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 279.

गविष्टि
गव्-इष्टि
 (lit. ‘desire of cows’) in several passages of the 
Rigveda
	1 denotes ‘conflict’ or ‘battle,’ evidently with reference 
to cattle raids. Gavyā
	2 is similarly used. 1) i. 91, 23; iii. 47, 4; v. 63, 5; vi. 31, 3; 47, 20; 59, 7; viii. 24, 2; ix.

land for the pasturing of cattle, in which sense Gavya is also 
found.
	3 Thence it derives the sense of a measure of distance 
found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	4 Geldner, on the other 
hand, takes the original meaning to be ‘road,’ real
	6 or meta
phorical,
	7 thence a measure of distance,
	8 and finally ‘land.’

गाथा
गाथा
 in the Rigveda
	1 usually means only ‘song,’ ‘verse,’ 
like Gātu.
	2 In one passage,
	3 however, it already has a more 
special sense, as it is classed with Nārāśaṃsī and Raibhī, a 
collocation repeatedly found later.
	4 The commentators identify 
the three terms with certain verses of the Atharvaveda,
	5 but 
Oldenberg
	6 has shown that this identification is incorrect for 
the Rigveda. Gāthās are often mentioned elsewhere,
	7 and are 
referred to as metrical in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka,
	8 where the 
Ṛc, Kumbyā, and Gāthā are classed as forms of verse. The 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	9 distinguishes between Ṛc and Gāthā as 
divine and human respectively. According to the usage of the 
Brāhmaṇas and the liturgical literature, as stated by the St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, the Gāthās are, though religious in 
content, distinguished from Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman as non
Vedic — that is, are not Mantras. This view is consistent with 
the fact that the phrase Yajña-gāthā, meaning a verse 
summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	10 preserves several Gāthās, which generally accord 
with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous 
kings, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	11 states that a Gāthā is 
sung at a wedding. Sometimes
	12 Gāthā is qualified as 
Nārāśaṃsī, where it must be a eulogy of a generous donor. 1) viii. 32, 1; 71, 14; 98, 9; ix. 99, 4;

even for the Rigveda. 7) Av. x. 10, 20; xv. 6, 4 (distinct

where the Gāthās are plainly Dānas
tutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ just as the 
Nārāśaṃsī verses are declared to be in 
the Bṛhaddevatā, iii. 154. 11) iii. 7, 3. 12) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 6. 
So Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 
44, 98, takes Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 
6, 8, where Sāyaṇa hesitates between 
identifying the two and distinguishing 
them. It seems reasonable to regard 
Gāthā as the wider term which covers, 
but is not coextensive with, Nārāśaṃsī. 
Cf. Sāyaṇa's example of a Gāthā in 
his commentary on Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 
ii. 3, 6: prātaḥ prātar anṛtaṃ te vadanti, 
‘they every morning tell an untruth,’ 
which is clearly not a Nārāśaṃsī.

vaveda, 689 et seq.; Weber, Episches im

गाथिन्
गाथिन्
 is mentioned as the son of Kuśika and father of 
Viśvāmitra in the Sarvānukramaṇī. It is difficult to say 
whether this tradition is correct; it derives some support from 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 18), where reference is made to 
the divine lore (daiva veda) of the Gāthins, which is said to be 
shared by Śunaḥśepa as a result of his adoption by Viśvāmitra. 
See Gāthina.

गाथिन
गाथिन
 — The sons of Viśvāmitra are described in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 as Gāthinas, or descendants of Gāthin, 
who, according to tradition, was their grandfather;

Viśvāmitra himself is styled Gāthina in the Sarvānukramaṇī. 1) vii. 18. Cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta

गान्दम|गांदम
गां-दम
 is the form in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 of the 
name of Ekayāvan, which in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 is read 
as Kāṃdama. 1) xxi. 14, 20. 2) ii. 7, 11, 2. Cf. Hopkins, Transac 
tions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts 
and Sciences, 15, 69.

गान्धार
गान्धार,
 ‘a king of Gandhāra’ named Nagnajit, is 
mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 In the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 he or some descendant figures as Svarjit Nāgnajita 
or Nagnajit, and as giving an opinion on the ritual, which is 
rejected with the observation that the author was merely a 
princely person (rājanya-bandhu). 1) vii. 34. in the list of teachers who handed down the knowledge of the 
substitute for Soma. 2) viii. 1, 4, 10.

गार्गीवाचक्नवी
गार्गी वाचक्नवी
 is referred to in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad
	1 as a female contemporary and rival of Yājñavalkya. 1) iii. 6, 1; 8, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 118.

गार्गीपुत्र
गार्गी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Gargī,’ occurs as the name of three 
teachers in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina 
recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30). The 
earliest of these three was the pupil of Bāḍeyīputra and the 
teacher of the second Gārgīputra. The latter was the teacher 
of Pārāśarīkauṇḍinīputra, the teacher of the third Gārgīputra.

गार्ग्य
गार्ग्य,
 ‘descendant of Garga,’ is the patronymic of Bālāki 
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
	1 and the Kauṣītaki
	2 Upaniṣads. Two 
Gārgyas are mentioned in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) 
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad:
	3 one of them is the pupil of 
Gārgya, who again is the pupil of Gautama. Others occur 
in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	4 and in the Nirukta,
	5 as well as later 
in the ritual Sūtras. Thus the family was evidently long 
connected with the development of liturgy and grammar. 1) ii. 1, 1. 2) iv. 1. 3) iv. 6, 2 (Kāṇva) 4) i. 7, 3. 5) i. 3. 12; iii. 13.

गार्ग्यायण
गार्ग्यायण,
 ‘descendant of Gārgya,’ is mentioned as a 
pupil of Uddālakāyana in the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) 
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 6, 2 Kāṇva).

गार्ग्यायणि
गार्ग्यायणि,
 ‘descendant of Gārgya,’ is a variant reading for 
Gāṅgyāyani as the patronymic of Citra in the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad (i. 1).

गालव
गालव
 is mentioned as a pupil of Vidarbhīkauṇḍinya in the 
first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad.
	1 It is possibly the same man that is referred to 
regarding a point of ritual in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
	2 A 
grammarian of this name is mentioned in the Nirukta.
	3 1) ii. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = 
ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). 2) v. 3, 3. 3) iv. 3. Cf. Pāṇini, vi. 3, 61; vii. 1, 
74; 3, 99; viii. 4, 67.

गिरि
गिरि,
 ‘mountain’ or ‘height,’ is a word that occurs repeatedly 
in the Rigveda.
	1 Thus reference is made to the trees on the 
hills, hence called ‘tree-haired’ (vṛkṣa-keśāḥ),
	2 and to the 
streams proceeding from the hills to the sea (samudra).
	3 The 
term is frequently coupled with the adjectival parvata.
	4 The 
Rigveda mentions the waters from the hills,
	5 and the Athar
vaveda
	6 refers to the snowy mountains. Actual names of 
mountains, as Mūjavant, Trikakud, Himavant, are very rare. 
References to Krauñca, Mahāmeru, and Maināga, are confined 
to the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, while Nāvaprabhraṃśana can no 
longer be considered a proper name.

गिरिक्षितौच्चामन्यव
गिरि-क्षित् औच्चा-मन्यव,
 ‘descendant of Uccāmanyu,’ is 
mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (x. 5, 7) as a con
temporary of Abhipratārin Kākṣaseṇi

गिरिजबाभ्रव्य
गिरि-ज बाभ्रव्य,
 ‘descendant of Babhru,’ is mentioned in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 1) as having been taught by 
Śrauta the method of dividing the sacrificial animal (paśor 
vibhakti).

गुग्गुलु
गुग्गुलु,
 ‘bdellium,’ is referred to in one passage of the 
Atharvaveda
	1 as produced by the Sindhu
	2 and by the sea. The 
latter source presumably alludes, as Zimmer
	3 assumes, to sea
borne trade, bdellium being the gum of a tree, not a product of 
the sea. It is, however, possible that in this passage some 
other substance may be meant. The word in this form also 
occurs elsewhere in the Atharvaveda
	4 and later;
	5 it is often
	6 
mentioned in the older form of Gulgulu, between which and 
Guggulu the manuscripts constantly vary 1) xix. 38, 2. 2) Or ‘from streams’ (saindhava), as 
Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
guggulu, suggests. 3) Altindisches Leben, 28. 4) ii. 36, 7. 5) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 28. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 6;

 — The descendants of Guṅgu are referred to as 
Guṅgus in a hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 apparently as friends of 
Atithigva. Possibly a people may be meant. 1) x. 48, 8. Cf. Ludwig. Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165.

गुप्त
गुप्त
 is the name in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 
(iii. 42) of Vaipaścita Dārḍhajayanti Gupta Lauhitya. All 
the three other names being patronymics show that he was 
descended from the families of Vipaścit, Dṛḍhajayanta, and 
Lohita.

गृत्समद
गृत्स-मद
 is the name of a seer to whom the Sarvānu
kramaṇī attributes the authorship of the second Maṇḍala of the 
Rigveda. This tradition is supported by the Aitareya Brāh 
maṇa
	1 and the Aitareya Araṇyaka.
	2 The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	3 
speaks of him as a Bhārgava, ‘descendant of Bhṛgu,’ with a 
variant Bābhrava, ‘descendant of Babhru,’ but the later 
tradition keeps to the former patronymic.
	4 The Gṛtsamadas 
are often mentioned in the second Maṇḍala of the Rigveda,
	5 
and are also called Śunahotras,
	6 but never Gārtsamadas or 
Śaunahotras, and Gṛtsamada himself never occurs there.

गृध्र
गृध्र,
 ‘the vulture,’ is often mentioned from the Rigveda
	1 
downwards.
	2 The swiftness of its flight
	3 and its fondness for 
devouring carrion are especially noticed.
	4 More generally the 
word is used to designate any bird of prey, the eagle (Śyena) 
being classed as the chief of the Gṛdhras.

गृष्टि
गृष्टि,
 ‘a young cow,’ which has only calved once, occurs in 
the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda,
	2 as well as in the later 
Sūtra literature.

गृह
गृह
 is used in the singular,
	1 or oftener in the plural,
	2 to 
denote the ‘house’ of the Vedic Indian. Dama or Dam has 
the same sense, while Pastyā and Harmya denote more 
especially the home with its surroundings, the family settle
ment. The house held not only the family, which might be of 
considerable size, but also the cattle
	3 and the sheep
	4 at night. 
It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural 
indicates, and it could be securely shut up.
	5 The door (Dvār, 
Dvāra) is often referred to, and from it the house is called 
Duroṇa. In every house the fire was kept burning.
	6 
Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presum
ably stone was not used,
	7 and houses were, as in Megasthenes' 
time,
	8 built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda
	9 give 
some information about the construction of a house, but the 
details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used 
do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear. 
According to Zimmer,
	10 four pillars (Upamit) were set up on a 
good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as 
props (Pratimit). The upright pillars were connected by cross 
beams (Parimit) resting upon them. The roof was formed of 
ribs of bamboo cane (vaṃśa),
	11 a ridge called Viṣūvant, and a 
net (Akṣu), which may mean a thatched covering
	12 over the 
bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles 
(palada), and the whole structure was held together with ties of 
various sorts (nahana, prāṇāha, saṃdaṃśa, pariṣvañjalya).
	13 In 
connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which, 
though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts 
of the building: Havirdhāna, ‘oblation-holder’; Agniśāla,
	14 ‘fire
place’; Patnīnāṃ Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting 
room.’ Slings or hanging vessels (Śikya) are also mentioned.
	15 
Reedwork (iṭa) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing 
of the walls of the house.
	16 The sides are called Pakṣa. The 
door with its framework was named Ātā. 1) Rv. iii. 53, 6; iv. 49, 6; viii. 10. 1,

Muir's view, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 461, that 
clay was used can only apply to the 
minor finishing of the walls of a house. 8) Arrian, Indica, x. 2. 9) iii. 12; ix. 3. See Bloomfield,

attach to the rendering of the words. 11) It seems likely that, as the ribs 
were of bamboo and were probably 
fixed in the ridge, the roof was wagon 
headed, like the huts of the Todas at the 
present day (see illustrations in Rivers, 
The Todas, pp. 25, 27, 28, 51), and the 
rock-cut Chaityas, or Assembly Halls, of 
the Buddhists in Western India, in some 
of the earliest of which the wooden 
ribs of the arched roof are still pre
served. See Fergusson, History of 
Indian Architecture, 22, 135, cf. 126. 12) Av. ix. 3, 8, where Bloomfield,

roof; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 136,

the Agniśāla with the central room, 
the Havirdhāna with a place for keep

the Patnīnāṃ Sadana with the women's

गो
1. Go (a), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’
	1 These were among the chief 
sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly 
referred to from the Rigveda onwards.
	2 The milk (Kṣīra) was 
either drunk fresh or made into butter (Ghṛta) or curds (Dadhi), 
or was mixed with Soma or used for cooking with grain 
(Kṣīraudana). The cows were milked thrice a day, early 
(prātar-doha), in the forenoon (Saṃgava), and in the evening 
(sāyaṃ-doha).
	3 Thrice a day they were driven out to graze, 
according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	4 (prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam). 
The first milking was productive, the last two scanty.
	3 According 
to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	5 among the Bharatas the herds in 
the evening are in the Goṣṭha, at midday in the Saṃgavīnī. 
This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home 
to the Śālā, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist 
of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the 
Goṣṭha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the 
cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before 
the Saṃgava, when the cows were grazing freely on the 
pastureland, was called Svasara.
	6 When the cows were out 
feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, how
ever, allowed to join them at the Saṃgava,
	7 and sometimes in 
the evening.
	8 
While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman 
(Gopā, Gopāla) armed with a goad,
	9 but they were liable to all sorts 
of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs,
	10 
and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was 
repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership.
	11 
Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the 
Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda,
	12 even when 
allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude. 
The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown
	13 
by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper 
them, and by the repeated prayers
	14 for wealth in kine. Hence, 
too, forays for cattle (Gaviṣṭi) were well known; the Bharata 
host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ (gavyan grāmaḥ) in the 
Rigveda;
	15 and a verbal root gup,
	16 ‘to protect,’ was evolved as 
early as the Rigveda from the denominative go-pāya, ‘to guard 
cows.’ The Vedic poets
	17 do not hesitate to compare their 
songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the 
singing Apsarases to cows.
	18 
The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red 
(rohita), light (śukra), dappled (pṛśni), even black (kṛṣṇa).
	19 
Zimmer
	20 sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one 
passage of the Rigveda,
	21 but this is uncertain. 
Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing 
wagons (anaḍvāh), in which case they were, it seems, usually 
castrated.
	22 Cows were not properly used for drawing carts, 
though they at times did so.
	23 The flesh of both cows and 
bulls was sometimes eaten (Māmsa). Cattle were certainly the 
objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the 
standards of exchange and valuation (see Kraya). 
(b) The term Go is often applied to express the products of 
the cow. It frequently means the milk,
	1 but rarely the flesh
	2 of 
the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the 
material of various objects, as a bowstring,
	3 or a sling,
	4 or 
thongs to fasten part of the chariot,
	5 or reins,
	6 or the lash 
of a whip.
	7 See also Carman, with which Go is sometimes 
synonymous.
	8 
(c) Gāvaḥ means the stars of heaven in two passages of the 
Rigveda,
	1 according to Roth.
	2 1) i. 83, 1; 135, 8; ii. 23, 18, etc.; 
gāva ukṣaṇaḥ, i. 168, 2; Av. iii. 11, 8;

dhenavaḥ, Rv. i. 173. 1; vi. 45. 28; 
x. 95, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 19. 
etc. 2) The five sacrificial animals are 
man, goat, sheep, ox, horse, Sāṅkh

notice is obscure. Strictly speaking the 
cows were driven out from the cattle
shed in the morning, spent the heat 
of the day in the Saṃgavinī, were then 
driven out during the evening to graze, 
and finally came or were driven home, 
as is often mentioned: Rv. i. 66, 5; 
149, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xv. 41. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 3, 1. 5) iii. 18, 14. 6) Rv. ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; 
viii. 88, 1; ix. 94, 2. The going of the 
cows to their pasture in the morning 
is often referred to — e.g., Rv. i. 25, 16; 
x. 97, 8. 7) Rv. ii. 2, 2; viii. 88, 1; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 1, 3; Śankara on

Rv. ii. 2, 2. See Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 111-114. 9) Pavīravān, Rv. x. 60, 3, is probably 
so meant. The usual name was Aṣṭrā, 
the significant mark of a Vaiśya. Cf. 
Rv. vii. 33, 6. 10) Rv. i. 120, 8; vi. 54, 5-7. Also 
Pūṣan was the special deity expected to

certain whether the names of Apsarases 
are meant in this passage. Cf. Ludwig,

2. Go Āṅgirasa (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the reputed

गोतम
गोतम
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda,
	1 but 
never in such a way as to denote personal authorship of any 
hymn.
	2 It seems clear that he was closely connected with the 
Aṅgirases, for the Gotamas frequently refer to Aṅgiras.
	3 That 
he bore the patronymic Rāhūgaṇa is rendered probable by one 
hymn of the Rigveda,
	4 and is assumed in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	5 where he appears as the Purohita, or domestic priest, of 
Māthava Videgha, and as a bearer of Vedic civilization. He 
is also mentioned in the same Brāhmaṇa
	6 as a contemporary of 
Janaka of Videha, and Yājñavalkya, and as the author of 
a Stoma.
	7 He occurs, moreover, in two passages of the 
Atharvaveda.
	8 
The Gotamas are mentioned in several passages of the 
Rigveda,
	9 Vāmadeva and Nodhas being specified as sons of 
Gotama. They include the Vājaśravases. See also Gautama. 1) Rv. i. 62, 13; 78, 2; 84, 5; 85, 11;

गोतमीपुत्र
गोतमी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Gotamī,’ is mentioned as a pupil of 
Bhāradvājī-putra in the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 1). See also Gautamī-putra.

गोत्र
गोत्र
 occurs several times in the Rigveda
	1 in the account of 
the mythic exploits of Indra. Roth
	2 interprets the word as 
‘cowstall,’ while Geldner
	3 thinks ‘herd’ is meant. The latter 
sense seems to explain best the employment which the term 
shows in the later literature as denoting the ‘family’ or ‘clan,’ 
and which is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	4 
In the Gṛhya Sūtras
	5 stress is laid on the prohibition of 
marriage within a Gotra, or with a Sapiṇḍa of the mother of 
the bridegroom — that is to say, roughly, with agnates and 
cognates. Senart
	6 has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste, 
on the ground that marriage within a curia, phratria, or caste 
(Varṇa) was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle 
of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all
	7 to 
prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the 
Śatapatha
	8 expressly recognizes marriage within the third or 
fourth degree on either side. According to Sāyaṇa, the Kāṇvas 
accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saurāṣṭras only in 
the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasūcī
	9 adḍs to the 
Kāṇvas the Andhras and the Dākṣiṇātyas, and remarks that 
the Vājasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the 
mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the 
daughter of a paternal uncle, which later was quite excluded. 
Change of Gotra was quite possible, as in the case of Śunaḥ- 
śepa and Gṛtsamada, who, once an Aṅgirasa, became a 
Bhārgava.

गोदान
गो-दान
 appears to mean ‘the whiskers’ in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where the person, being consecrated, first shaves 
off the right and then the left ‘whisker.’ Later on the Godāna
vidhi, or ceremony of shaving the head, is a regular part of the 
initiation of a youth on the attainment of manhood and on 
marriage;
	2 but though the ceremony is recognized in the 
Atharvaveda,
	3 the name
	4 does not occur there. 1) iii. 1, 2, 5, 6. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 19; 
Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 28, etc. 3) vi. 68. See Kauśika Sūtra, liii. 17
20. But Av. ii. 13 is not to be classed 
here as in the Kauśika; it refers to the 
giving of a new garment to a child, 
and the removal of its first wrap. See 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 56, 57, correcting Weber, Indische 
Studien, 13, 173, and Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 322, 323. Cf. Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 306, 574, 665. 4) The meaning ‘whisker’ is a secon
dary one, derived, doubtless, from the 
‘gift of a cow’ (go-dāna), accompanying 
the ceremony of shaving the whiskers 
or hair.

गोधा
गोधा
 — (a) The sense of ‘bowstring’ seems certain in one 
passage of the Rigveda,
	1 and possible in another.
	2 Roth
	3 
also adopts this meaning in the only passage of the Atharva
veda
	4 where the word occurs. 
(b) In one passage of the Rigveda
	1 the sense of ‘musical 
instrument’ is recognized by Roth and by Hillebrandt
	2 for 
this word. 
(c) Elsewhere
	1 an animal seems to be meant, perhaps the 
‘crocodile,’ as Ludwig
	2 and Weber
	3 think; perhaps a large 
‘lizard,’ as Roth and Zimmer
	4 assume. An animal is probably 
also meant in the Atharvaveda.

गोपति
गो-पति,
 ‘lord of cows,’ is freely used in the Rigveda
	1 to 
denote any lord or master, a natural usage considering that 
cattle formed the main species of wealth. 1) i. 101, 4; iv. 24, 1; vi. 45, 21; vii. 18, 4, etc. Av. iii. 14, 6, etc.

गोपा
गो-पा
 and Go-pāla, ‘protector of cows,’ occur in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later, but the former is usually metaphorical in 
sense, applying to any protector, while the latter has the literal 
force of ‘cow-herd.’ 1) Gopā: Rv. i. 164, 21; ii. 23, 6; 
iii. 10, 2; v. 12, 4, etc.; Gopāla: Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 11; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 4. Gopā, in the 
sense of ‘guardian,’ occurs in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 18, in a 
compound. Gopītha, in the sense of 
‘protection,’ occurs in Rv. v. 65, 6; 
x. 35, 14, etc. Goptṛ, ‘protector,’ first 
occurs in Av. x. 10, 5, and is thereafter 
common.

गोबल
गो-बल
 (‘ox-strength’) Vārṣṇa (‘descendant of Vṛṣṇi’) is 
mentioned as a teacher in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (iii. 11, 9, 3) 
and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 6, 1).

गोमती
गो-मती,
 ‘possessing cows,’ is mentioned as a river in the 
Nadī-stuti, or ‘Praise of Rivers,’ in the tenth Maṇḍala of the 
Rigveda.
	1 In that hymn a river flowing into the Indus must 
be meant, and its identification
	2 with the Gomal, a western 
tributary of the Indus, cannot be doubted. In one other passage 
of the Rigveda
	3 the accentuation of Gomati shows that a river is 
meant. It is possible that in a third passage
	4 the reading 
should be changed to gomatír from gómatīr. Geldner
	5 suggests 
that in the two last passages the Gumti, or rather its four 
upper arms (hence the use of the plural) is meant: this accords 
well with the later use of the name and with the general 
probability of the river here intended being in Kurukṣetra, as 
the centre of Vedic civilization.

गोमायु
गो-मायु,
 ‘lowing like a cow,’ does not occur as the name of 
the ‘jackal’ till the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa.

गोमृग
गो-मृग,
 a species of ox, now called Gayal (Bos gavaeus), is 
mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha, or horse 
sacrifice, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and Brāhmaṇas.
	2 In the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 it is declared to be neither a wild nor a 
tame animal; this presumably means that it was semi
domesticated, or perhaps that it was both tamed and found 
wild. With the name of this animal may be compared the 
Mṛga Mahiṣa, which is clearly mentioned as wild in the 
Rigveda.

गोष्ठ
गो-ष्ठ,
 ‘standing-place for cows,’ denotes not so much a

ग्रह
ग्रह
 (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 most probably not in the later sense of 
‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence.
	2 
The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature, 
as in the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad.
	3 The question whether the 
planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in 
obscurity. Oldenberg
	4 recognizes them in the Ādityas, whose 
number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets. 
But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even 
unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by 
Hillebrandt,
	5 Pischel,
	6 von Schroeder,
	7 Macdonell,
	8 and Bloom
field,
	9 among others. Hillebrandt
	10 sees the planets in the five 
Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda,
	11 but this is a mere con
jecture. The five bulls (ukṣāṇaḥ) in another passage of the 
Rigveda
	12 have received a similar interpretation with equal 
uncertainty,
	13 and Durga, in his commentary on the Nirukta,
	14 
even explains the term bhūmija, ‘earth-born,’ which is only men
tioned by Yāska, as meaning the planet Mars.
	15 Thibaut,
	16 
who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the 
Veda, thinks that Bṛhaspati there refers to Jupiter; but this is 
extremely improbable, though in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	17 
Bṛhaspati is made the regent of Tiṣya. A reference to the 
planets is much more probable in the seven suns (sapta sūryāḥ) 
of the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	18 On the other hand, Ludwig's 
efforts to find the five planets with the sun, the moon, and the 
twenty-seven Nakṣatras (lunar mansions) in the Rigveda, as 
corresponding to the number thirty-four used in connexion with 
light
	19 (jyotis) and the ribs of the sacrificial horse,
	20 is far
fetched. See also Śukra, Manthin, Vena. 1) iv. 6, 5, 1. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.;

ग्राम
ग्राम
 — The primitive sense of this word, which occurs 
frequently from the Rigveda
	1 onwards, appears to have been 
‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which 
were scattered over the country, some close together,
	2 some far 
apart, and were connected by roads.
	3 The village is regularly 
contrasted with the forest (araṇya), and its animals and plants 
with those that lived or grew wild in the woods.
	4 The villages 
contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as 
men.
	5 Grain was also stored in them.
	6 In the evening the 
cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.
	7 The villages 
were probably open, though perhaps a fort (Pur) might on 
occasion be built inside.
	8 Presumably they consisted of 
detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found 
in Vedic literature. Large villages (mahāgrāmāḥ) were known.
	9 
The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with 
precision. In several passages
	10 the word occurs with what 
appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This 
sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote 
the ‘village folk,’ as when Śaryāta Mānava is said in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	11 to have wandered about with his 
‘village’ (grāmeṇa); but, as Zimmer
	12 observes, this restricted 
sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda,
	13 where indeed 
the ‘folk’ (jana)
	14 of the Bharatas is in one passage
	15 called 
the ‘horde seeking cows’ (gavyan grāmaḥ). Zimmer
	16 tends to 
regard the Grāma as a clan, and as standing midway between 
the family and the tribe (Viś). The Grāma may, however, 
perhaps be regarded more correctly
	17 as an aggregate of several 
families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan 
(Viś), as is often the case at the present day.
	18 
Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy 
of the village. There is nothing to show that the community 
as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that 
individual tenure of land was known (see Urvarā, Kṣetra), but 
this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a 
family rather than by an individual person. The expression 
‘desirous of a village’ (grāma-kāma), which occurs frequently in 
the later Saṃhitās,
	19 points, however, to the practice of the king's 
granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so 
far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later
	20 the idea developed 
that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that 
idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords. 
But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond 
the word grāma-kāma, which much more probably refers to the 
grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels 
show.
	21 Such grants probably tended to depress the position 
of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but 
they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent 
in early times. 
The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal 
purposes in early days,
	22 and it can hardly be said to have been 
a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its 
members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and 
also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest 
in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land, 
such as chariot-makers (Ratha-kāra), carpenters (Takṣan), 
smiths (Karmāra), and others, but they did not presumably, in 
any sense, form part of the brotherhood.
	23 All alike were 
politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or 
service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to 
others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often 
the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village 
is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.
	24 
At the head of the village was the Grāma-ṇī, or ‘leader of 
the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda,
	25 and often in 
the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas.
	26 The exact 
meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer
	27 the Grāmaṇī 
is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is 
certainly often connected with the Senānī, or ‘leader of an 
army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: pre
sumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil 
purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	28 as inferior to the Sūta, or ‘charioteer,’ 
with whom, however, he is associated
	29 as one of the Ratnins, 
the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially 
valuable to a Vaiśya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit 
of prosperity (gataśrī).
	30 The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the 
royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of 
the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post 
may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nomi
nated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available. 
The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the 
Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was 
situated was specially honoured and influential.

tribe (Jana). 17) A village might contain a whole 
clan, but probably it contained at most 
a section of a clan. By family is meant 
a Hindu joint family; but the extent 
to which such families existed, and the 
number of persons included, cannot 
even be conjectured from the avail 
able evidence. Cf. Schrader, Prchistoric

Community, 207 et seq. Whether or not 
the idea is already found in Manu, 
ix. 34, is disputed and uncertain. See 
Rājan. The germ of it lies in a differ
ent sphere — the right of the Kṣatriya, 
with the consent of the clan, to appor

of English Law, 2, 237 et seq.; Baden 
Powell, Village Communities in India, 
83; Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 
48. It may be mentioned that we have 
no Vedic evidence as to the non-sale 
of land by the members of a family, 
except the indications mentioned under 
Urvarā. The later evidence is over
whelming for grāma, meaning ‘village.’

many Grāmaṇīs in a kingdom, but the 
texts seem to contemplate only one as 
in the royal entourage. Cf. also Eggel
ing, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 60, n.; 
Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 13, 96; Rhys Davids, op. cit., 
48, thinks that he was elected by the 
village council or a hereditary officer, 
because the appointment is only claimed 
for the king in late authorities like 
Manu, vii. 115. But there is not even 
so much authority for election or 
heredity, and we really cannot say 
how far the power of the early princes 
extended: it probably varied very 
much. Cf. Rājan and Citraratha.

ग्राम्यवादिन्
ग्राम्य-वादिन्
 apparently means a ‘village judge’ in the 
Yajurveda.
	1 His Sabhā, ‘court,’ is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 4; Maitrāyanī Saṃhitā,

ग्राह
ग्राह,
 ‘the seizer,’ is the name of a disease in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 In the Atharvaveda
	2 it perhaps means ‘paralysis’ 
of the thigh.
	3 1) iii. 5, 3, 25; 6, 1, 25. 2) xi. 9, 12. 3) If the reading of the commentary

retaining the reading of the text uru- 
grāhaiḥ, renders the compound as an 
adjective, ‘wide-gripping.’ Cf. Bloom
field, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 635.

ग्राहि
ग्राहि,
 ‘the seizer,’ appears in the Rigveda
	1 and the Athar

ग्लाव मैत्रेय
 (‘descendant of Maitrī’) is mentioned in the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	1 where he is said to be the same as 
Vaka Dālbhya. He appears as Pratistotṛ at the snake festival 
of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,

ग्लौ
ग्लौ
 occurs in the Atharvaveda
	1 and in the Aitareya Brāh

	2 as the name of some symptom of a disease, probably, 
as Bloomfield
	3 thinks, ‘boils.’ In the one passage of the

some part of the sacrificial victim being perhaps meant.

घृत
घृत,
 the modern Ghee or ‘clarified butter,’ is repeatedly 
mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 both as in ordinary use 
and as a customary form of sacrifice. According to a citation 
in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 the dis
tinction between Ghṛta and Sarpis consisted in the latter being 
butter fully melted, while the former was butter melted and 
hardened (ghanī-bhūta), but this distinction cannot be pressed. 
Because the butter was thrown into the fire, Agni is styled 
‘butter-faced’ (ghṛta-pratīka),
	4 ‘butter-backed’ (ghṛta-pṛṣṭha),
	5 
and ‘propitiated with butter’ (ghṛta-prasatta),
	6 and ‘found of 
butter’ (ghṛta-prī).
	7 Water was used to purify the butter: the 
waters were therefore called ‘butter-cleansing’ (ghṛta-pū).
	8 In 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^9 it is said that Ājya, Ghṛta, Āyuta, and 
Navanīta pertain to gods, men, Pitṛs, and embryos respectively. 1) i. 134, 6; ii. 10, 4; iv. 10, 6; 58,

घृतकौशिक
घृत-कौशिक
 is mentioned in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of 
teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad
	1 as a pupil of Pārāśaryāyaṇa. 1) ii. 5. 21; iv. 5, 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 384.

घोरआङ्गिरस
घोर आङ्गिरस
 is the name of a mythical teacher in the 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	2 where he 
is teacher of the strange Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra. That the name 
is certainly a mere figment is shown by the fact that this 
‘dread descendant of the Aṅgirases’ has a counterpart in 
Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa,
	3 ‘the healing descendant of the Atharvans,’ 
while in the Rigveda Sūtras
	4 the Atharvāṇo vedaḥ is connected 
with bheṣajam and the Āṅgiraso vedaḥ with ghoram. He is 
accordingly a personification of the dark side of the practice 
of the Atharvaveda.
	5 He is also mentioned in the Aśvamedha 
section of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.

घोष
घोष
 See Ghoṣā.

घोषवत्|घोषवन्त्
घोषवन्त्
 See Svara.

घोषा
घोषा
 is mentioned as a protégée of the Aśvins in two 
passages of the Rigveda,
	1 probably as the recipient of a husband, 
who is perhaps referred to in another passage
	2 as Arjuna, 
though this is not likely. Sāyaṇa finds a reference there to 
a skin disease, which is considered in the later tradition of the 
Bṛhaddevatā
	3 to have been the cause of her remaining unwed, 
but this view is not tenable. According to Sāyaṇa, her son, 
Suhastya, is alluded to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda;
	4 
Oldenberg,
	5 however, here sees a reference to Ghoṣā herself, 
while Pischel
	6 thinks that the form (ghoṣe) is not a noun at all, 
but verbal. 1) i. 117, 7; x. 40, 5. Cf. x. 39, 3. 6. 2) i. 122, 5. See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda- 
Noten, 1, 123. 3) vii. 41-48, with Macdonell's notes. 4) i. 120, 5. 5) Op. cit., 119. Suhastya is apparently 
invented from x. 41, 3, probably assisted 
by the fact that Vadhrimatī was given 
a son, Hiraṇyahasta, by the Aśvins 
(Rv. i. 117, 24). 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 4; 2, 92.

n. 3, 144

चक्र
चक्र,
 the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly 
mentioned from the Rigveda
	1 onwards, often in a metaphorical 
sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle (Akṣa) when the 
chariot was required for use; this required considerable 
strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda.
	2 The 
wheel consisted normally of spokes (Ara), and a nave (Nābhi),
	3 
in the opening (Kha) of which the end of the axle (Āṇi) was 
inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the 
strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god 
Pūṣan as having a wheel that suffers no damage.
	4 The usual 
number of wheels was two,
	5 but in seven passages of the Rigveda
	6 
a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘seven
wheeled,’
	7 while in one of the Atharvaveda
	8 it is styled ‘eight
wheeled.’ Zimmer
	9 argues that these epithets do not refer to 
real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where 
tri-cakra, ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference. 
On the other hand, Weber
	10 thinks that there might have been 
chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the 
two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the 
seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be 
regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that 
number of wheels. 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	11 the potter's wheel (kaulāla- 
cakra) is referred to. 1) i. 130, 9; 155, 6; 164, 2. 11. 14; 
174, 5; iv. 1, 3, etc. 2) Av. xi. 7, 4; xix. 53, 1. 2, etc. 3) Rv. viii. 41, 6. 4) Rv. vi. 54, 3. 5) Rv. viii. 5, 29; Chāndogya Upani

chariot); iv. 36, 1 (of a chariot made 
by the Ṛbhus, who are three in 
number). 7) Rv. i. 164, 3, 12; ii. 40, 3. 8) xi. 4, 22. 9) Altindisches Leben, viii., ix. 10) Proceedings of the Berlin Acadcmy,

चक्रवाक
चक्र-वाक
 is the name, apparently derived from the nature 
of its cry, of a species of gander (Anas casarca), the modern 
Chakwā, as it is called in Hindī, or Brahmany duck in English.
	1 
It is mentioned in the Rigveda
	2 and in the list of victims at the 
Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda,
	3 while in the 
Atharvaveda
	4 it already appears as the type of conjugal fidelity, 
its characteristic in the classical literature. 1) Criffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 309, n. 4. 2) ii. 39, 3. 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 3. 13; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 22. 32; 
xxv. 8. 4) xiv. 2, 64. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 89.

चक्षुस्
चक्षुस्,
 ‘eye.’ The ‘evil eye’ (ghoraṃ cakṣus) was well 
known in the Atharvaveda, which contains spells to counteract 
its influence.
	1 As remedies against it are mentioned salve from 
Mount Trikakubh
	2 and the Jaṅgiḍa plant.
	3 In the wedding 
ceremony the wife is entreated not to have the evil eye (aghora- 
cakṣus).
	4 The structure of the eye, and its division into white 
(śukla), dark (kṛṣṇa), and the pupil (kanīn ikā) are repeatedly 
referred to in the later Brāhmaṇas.
	5 The desease Alaji appears 
to have been an affection of the eyes. 1) ii. 7; xix. 45, are so employed in 
the ritual. 2) Av. iv. 9, 6. 3) Av. xix. 35, 3. 4) Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 4; Śāṅkh
āyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 16. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 2,

34, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 2; 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, 5, etc. So 
the man (puru 1) in the eye is repeatedly 
mentioned: Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 7, 
5; iv. 15, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 
ii. 3, 5; iv. 2, 2; v. 5, 2. 4, etc.; 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 27, 2. 
The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 2, 3, 
adds the water (āpaḥ) in the eye, the 
upper and the lower lids (vartanī), and 
seven red lines (lohinyo rājayaḥ). 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 13, 149.

चण्डाल
चण्डाल,
 
	1 Cāṇḍāla,
	2 are the variant forms of the name of a 
despised caste, which in origin was probably a tribal body,
	3 but 
which in the Brahminical theory was the offspring of Śūdra 
fathers and Brahmin mothers.
	4 The references to the caste in 
he Yajurveda Saṃhitās and in the Upaniṣads show clearly 
hat it was a degraded one, but they yield no particulars. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 10, 7; 
14, 4; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 9;

चतुष्पद्
चतुष्-पद्,
 ‘quadruped,’ is a regular name for animals from 
the Rigveda

‘biped.’

‘animals,’ is also found.

चन्द्र
1. Candra, 
	1 Candra-mas,
	2 are the names of the ‘moon,’ the 
latter occurring from the Rigveda onwards, but the former 
being first used in this sense by the Atharvaveda. Very little is 
said about the moon in Vedic literature, except as identified 
with Soma,
	3 both alike being described as waxing and waning. 
Reference is, however, made to the regular changes of the 
moon, and to its alternation with the sun,
	5 to which it, as Soma, 
is declared in the Rigveda to be married.
	6 Mention is also 
made of its disappearance at the time of new moon,
	7 and of its 
birth from the light of the sun.
	8 In the Atharvaveda
	9 reference 
is made to demons eclipsing the moon (grahāś cāndramāsāḥ).

time, see Māsa. For the moon and its mansions, see Nakṣatra.

चमस
चमस
 denotes a ‘drinking vessel,’ usually as employed for 
holding Soma at the sacrifice. It is frequently mentioned from 
the Rigveda onwards.
	1 It was made of wood (vṛkṣa),
	2 and is 
hence called dru.
	3 According to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	4 it 
was made of Udumbara wood. 1) Rv. i. 20, 6; 110, 3; viii. 82, 7;

चमू
चमू
 is a term of somewhat doubtful sense occurring 
repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation 
of Soma. Zimmer
	1 considers that in the dual it denotes the 
two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was 
crushed (cf. Adhiṣavaṇa). Roth,
	2 however, appears to be right 
in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the 
Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt
	3 shows 
clearly that when it occurs in the plural
	4 it always has this 
sense, corresponding to the Graha-pātras of the later ritual, 
and that sometimes it is so used in the singular
	5 or dual
	6 also. 
In some cases,
	7 however, he recognizes its use as denoting the 
mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here, 
as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian.
	8 
In a derivative sense Camū appears in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	9 to denote a trough, either of solid stone or consisting of 
bricks, used by the Eastern people to protect the body of the 
dead from contact with the earth, like modern stone-lined 
graves or vaults. 1) Altindisches Leben, 277, 278. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf.

sense is doubtful.

चरक
चरक
 primarily denotes a ‘wandering student,’ a sense 
actually found in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 More 
especially it denotes the members of a school of the Black 
Yajurveda, the practices of which are several times referred to 
with disapproval in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā
	3 the Caraka teacher (Carakācārya) is enumerated 
among the sacrificial victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human 
sacrifice. His dedication there to ill-doing is a clear hint of a 
ritual feud. 1) iii. 3, 1. 2) iii. 8, 2, 24 (where the reference is 
to Taittirīya Saṃhitā vi. 3, 9, 6; 10, 2,

viii. 1, 3, 7; 7, 1, 14. 24. 3) xxx. 18; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 
16, 1. Its occurrence in the latter text 
renders improbable von Schroeder's 
view, Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 188, 
that Caraka included all the Black 
Yajurveda schools.

 is the name of a work from which Sāyaṇa 
quotes in his commentary on the Rigveda.

चराचर
चराचर
 (‘running about’), a term found classed with 
Sarīsṛpa in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 must apparently denote 
some kind of animal. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 13, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 3; Maitrāyaṇī

चरु
चरु
 designates a ‘kettle’ or ‘pot’ from the Rigveda 
onwards.
	1 It had a lid (apidhāna) and hooks (aṅka) by which 
it could be hung over a fire.
	2 It was made of iron or bronze
	3 
(ayasmaya). The word is also secondarily used
	4 to denote the 
contents of the pot, the mess of grain which was cooked in it. 1) Rv. i. 7, 6; vii. 104, 2; ix. 52, 3;

चर्मन्
चर्मन्,
 denoting ‘hide’ in general, is a common expression 
from the Rigveda onwards.
	1 The oxhide was turned to many 
uses, such as the manufacture of bowstrings, slings, and reins 
(see Go). It was especially often employed to place above the 
boards
	2 on which the Soma was pressed with the stones.
	3 It 
was possibly also used for making skin bags.
	4 Carmaṇya 
denotes leather-work generally in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	5 
The art of tanning hides (mlā) was known as early as the 
Rigveda,
	6 where also the word for ‘tanner’ (carmamna) occurs.
	7 
Details of the process are lacking, but the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	8 
refers to stretching out a hide with pegs (śañkubhiḥ), and the 
Rigveda
	9 mentions the wetting of the hide. 1) Rv. i. 85, 5; 110, 8; 161, 7;

चर्षणि
चर्षणि,
 used in the plural, denotes in the Rigveda
	1 ‘men’ 
in general or ‘people,’ conceived either as active beings
	2 or as 
cultivators
	3 in opposition to nomads. The expression ‘king of 
men’ (rājā carṣaṇīnām) is frequently found.
	4 The ‘people’ are 
also mentioned in connexion with war.
	5 In the Atharvaveda
	6 
‘animals’ (paśu) and ‘men’ (carṣaṇi) are spoken of together.

चाक्र
चाक्र
 is the name of a man, variously styled Revottaras 
Sthapati Pāṭava Cākra
	1 and Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,
	2 
who is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa only. He is 
there said to have been expelled by the Sṛñjayas, but to have 
restored to them their prince Duṣṭarītu despite the opposition 
of the Kauravya king Balhika Prātipīya.
	2 He must have been 
a sage rather than a warrior, as the first passage of the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 shows him in the capacity of a teacher only. Cf. 
Sthapati. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. xii. 8, 1, 17. 2) Ibid., xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq.

 See Caṇḍāla.

चाक्षुष
चाक्षुष,
 a word occurring once only in the Atharvaveda,
	1 is, 
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a patronymic (of 
Suyāman, a personification). Whitney
	2 treats it as probably 
a simple adjective (‘of sight’). 1) xvi. 7, 7. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 800.

चातुर्मास्य
चातुर्-मास्य,
 ‘four-monthly,’ denotes the festival of the 
Vedic ritual held at the beginning of the three seasons of four 
months each, into which the Vedic year was artificially divided.
	1 
It is clear that the sacrifices commenced with the beginning 
of each season,
	2 and it is certain that the first of them, the 
Vaiśvadeva, coincided with the Phālgunī full moon,
	3 the second, 
the Varuṇa-praghāsas, with the Āṣāḍhī full moon,
	4 and the 
third, the Sāka-medha, with the Kārttikī full moon.
	5 There 
were, however, two alternative datings: the festivals could also 
be held in the Caitrī, the Śrāvaṇī, and Āgrahāyaṇī (Mārgaśīrṣī) 
full moons,
	6 or in the Vaiśākhī, Bhādrapadī, and Pauṣī full 
moons.
	7 Neither of the later datings is found in a Brāhmaṇa 
text, but each may well have been known early, since the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	8 and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	9 both 
recognize the full moon in the month Caitra as an alternative 
to the full moon in the month Phālguna, for the beginning of 
the year. 
Jacobi considers that the commencement of the year with the 
full moon in the asterism Phalgunī, which is supported by other 
evidence,
	10 indicates that the year at one time began with the winter 
solstice with the moon in Phalgunī, corresponding to the summer 
solstice when the sun was in Phalgunī. These astronomical 
conditions, he believes, existed in the time of the Rigveda,
	11 
and prevailed in the fourth millennium B.C. The alternative 
dates would then indicate periods when the winter solstice 
coincided with the Caitrī or the Vaiśākhī full moon. But 
Oldenberg
	12 and Thibaut
	13 seem clearly right in holding that 
the coincidence of Phālgunī with the beginning of spring,
	14 
which is certain, is fatal to this view, and that there is no 
difficulty in regarding this date as consistent with the date of 
the winter solstice in the new moon of Māgha, which is given 
by the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,
	15 and which forms the basis of 
the calculations of the Jyotiṣa.
	16 The full moon in Phālguna 
would be placed about one month and a half after the winter 
solstice, or, say, in the first week of February, which date, 
according to Thibaut, may reasonably be deemed to mark the 
beginning of a new season in India about 800 B.C. At the 
same time it must be remembered that the date was necessarily 
artificial, inasmuch as the year was divided into three seasons, 
each of four months, and the Indian year does not in fact 
consist of three equal seasons. The variations of the other 
datings would then not be unnatural if any school wished to 
defer its spring festival, the Vaiśvadeva, to the time when 
spring had really manifested itself. See also Saṃvatsara. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 5, 3;

ruary-March. 4) In the month Āṣāḍhā, or June
July. 5) That is, in the month Kārttika, 
when the moon is in the asterism 
Kṛttikā: Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 3,

Citra as king of the rats.

चित्ररथ
चित्र-रथ
 (‘having a brilliant car’) is the name of two 
persons. 
(a) It designates an Āryan prince, who, with Arṇa, was 
defeated by Indra for the Turvaśa-Yadus on the Sarayu (per
haps the modern Sarju in Oudh), according to the Rigveda (iv. 
30, 18). The locality would accord with the close connexion 
of Turvaśa and Krivi or Pañcāla. 
(b) Citraratha is also the name of a king for whom the 
Kāpeyas performed a special kind of sacrifice (dvirātra), with 
the result, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 that in the 
Caitrarathi family only one member was a Kṣatra-pati, the rest 
dependents. Apparently this must mean that the Caitrarathis 
were distinguished from other families of princes by the fact 
that the chief of the clan received a markedly higher position 
than in most cases, in which probably the heads of the family 
were rather an oligarchy than a monarch and his dependents.

चिल्वटि
 is the name of an unknown animal in the Gopatha

चीपुद्रु
चीपुद्रु
 designates some substance mentioned in a hymn of 
the Atharvaveda
	1 as of use in healing. The commentator 
Sāyaṇa reads Cīpadru, and explains the word as a kind of tree. 
This interpretation is supported by the fact that the Kauśika 
Sūtra
	2 refers to the employment of splinters of Palāśa wood in 
the ritual application of this hymn.

the form of the word should be Cīpuḍu. 1) vi. 127, 2. 2) xxvi. 34. 3) Av. vi. 127. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda,

text of Roth and Whitney reads by

चुमुरि
चुमुरि
 is the name of an enemy of Dabhīti, for whom he, 
along with his friend Dhuni, is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as 
having been defeated by Indra. Elsewhere
	2 the two are spoken 
of, along with Śambara, Pipru, and Śuṣṇa, as having been

to say whether real men or demons are meant, but in favour of 
a man being denoted by Cumuri is the form of the name, which 
seems not to be Āryan.

चूडभागवित्ति
चूड भागवित्ति
 (‘descendant of Bhagavitta’) is mentioned in 
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaṇiṣad
	1 as a pupil of Madhuka Paiṅgya. 1) vi. 3, 9 (Kāṇva=vi. 3, 17. 18 Mādhyaṃdina). The text of the Kāṇva has,

चूर्ण
चूर्ण
 appears to denote an aromatic powder in the phrase 
cūrṇa-hasta, used of the Apsarases in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad (i. 4).

चेदि
चेदि
 is the name of a people who, with their king Kaśu, the 
Caidya, are mentioned only in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’), 
occurring at the end of one hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 where their 
generosity is celebrated as unsurpassed. They occur later in 
the Epic with the Matsyas, and lived in Bandela Khaṇḍa 
(Bundelkhand).
	2 In Vedic times they were probably situated 
in much the same locality. 1) viii. 5, 37-39. 2) Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, 12,

चैकितानेय
चैकितानेय
 (‘descendant of Cekitāna’) is mentioned as a

	1 The Caikitā

which they worshipped. Brahmadatta Caikitāneya is brought 
into connexion with the Sāman in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	3 
and Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya is known to the Ṣaḍviṃśa
	4 and 
Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇas.
	5 The word is a patronymic, formed from 
Caikitāna, according to Śaṅkara,
	6 but more probably from 
Cekitāna,
	7 a name found in the Epic. 1) i. 37, 7; ii. 5, 2. 2) i. 42, 1. 3) i. 3, 24. 4) iv. 1. 5) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 384. 6) On Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,

चैलकि,
 ‘descendant of Celaka,’ is the patronymic of Jīvala

चोर
चोर,
 ‘thief,’ is only found in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, a late 
work, in its last book (x. 65). The Vedic terms are Taskara 
Tāyu, Stena, and Paripanthin.

च्यवतानमारुताश्व
च्यवतान मारुताश्व
 (‘descendant of Marutāśva’) is 
apparently the name of a prince in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of 
Gifts’), in the Rigveda.
	1 Two distinct persons may, however, 
be meant. 1) v. 33, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3. 155.

च्यवन
च्यवन,
 
	1 Cyavāna,
	2 are variant forms of the name of an 
ancient Ṛṣi, or seer. The Rigveda
	3 represents him as an old 
decrepit man, to whom the Aśvins restored youth and strength, 
making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens. 
The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	4 where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanyā, 
the daughter of Śaryāta. He is there called a Bhṛgu or 
Āṅgirasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by 
immersion in a pond — the first occurrence of a motive, later 
very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about 
Cyavāna is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the 
Rigveda,
	5 where he seems to be opposed to the Paktha prince 
Tūrvayāṇa, an Indra worshipper, while Cyavāna seems to 
have been specially connected with the Aśvins. This explana
tion of the hymn, suggested by Pischel,
	6 is corroborated by the 
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,
	7 which relates that Vidanvant, another 
son of Bhṛgu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was 
angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also note
worthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	8 as 
obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanyā. 
But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken 
place, because the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	9 relates the inauguration 
of Śāryāta by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration 
(aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā
	10 
Cyavana is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans or Chants. 1) This form is found even in the 
Nirukta (iv. 19), regularly in all 
the Vedic texts other than the Rigveda, 
and in the Epic. 2) The Rv. has this form through
out. 3) i. 116, 10; 117, 13; 118, 6; v. 74, 5;

 is used once in the Rigveda,

something analogous to these. Weber
	3 thinks that in one 
passage of the Atharvaveda
	4 the word designates a constella
tion, and Whitney,
	5 who does not decide whether that interpre
tation is necessary, suggests that the constellation  
Aquarii may be meant, since the next verse mentions Vicṛtau, 
which is the constellation  and  Scorpionis, and is not far 
from Aquarius. See also Chardis. 1) x. 85, 10 (of Sūryā's bridal car). 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 9, 4;

छन्दस्
1. Chandas in the Rigveda usually denotes a ‘song of 
praise’ or ‘hymn.’
	1 The original sense of the word, as derived 
from the verb chand, ‘to please,’ was probably ‘attractive 
spell,’ ‘magic hymn,’
	2 which prevailed on the gods. In a very 
late hymn of the Rigveda,
	3 as well as in one of the Atharvaveda,
	4 
the word is mentioned in the plural (chandāṃsi), beside Ṛc 
(ṛcaḥ), Sāman (sāmāni), and Yajus, and seems to retain its 
original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical 
subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical) 
hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the 
Rigveda,
	5 in which the ‘Gāyatrī, the Triṣṭubh, and all (sarvā) 
the metres (chandāṃsi) are mentioned. In the later Saṃhitās 
three
	6 or seven
	7 metres are enumerated, and in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	8 eight. By the time of the Rigveda Prātiśākhya
	9 
the metres were subjected to a detailed examination, though 
much earlier references are found to the number of syllables in 
the several metres.
	10 Later the word definitely denotes a Vedic 
text generally, as in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

2. Chandas occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 in the 
adjectival compound bṛhac-chandas, which is used of a house, 
and must mean ‘having a large roof.’ Bloomfield

reading as correct, but Whitney

Chadis necessary. 1) iii. 12, 3. 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 345;

छन्दोग
छन्दो-ग,
 ‘metre-singing,’ is the term applied to reciters of 
the Sāmans, no doubt because these chants were sung according 
to their order in the Chandaārcika of the Sāmaveda. It is 
only found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and often in the 
Sūtras.

छर्दिस्
छर्दिस्
 occurs often in the Rigveda,
	1 and occasionally later,
	2 
denoting a secure dwelling-place. The word appears to be 
incorrectly written, because the metre shows that the first 
syllable is always short. Roth
	3 accordingly suggested that 
Chadis should be read instead. But Chadis means ‘roof,’ while 
Chardis never has that sense. Bartholomae
	4 is therefore prob
ably right in suggesting some other form, such as Chaḍis. 1) i. 48, 15; 114, 5; vi. 15, 3; 46, 9.

जगत्,
 ‘moving,’ is applied sometimes in the Atharvaveda,

cated animals.

जङ्गिड
जङ्गिड
 is the name of a healing plant mentioned in the 
hymns of the Atharvaveda.
	1 It was used as an amulet against 
the diseases, or symptoms of disease, Takman, Balāsa, 
Āśarīka, Viśarīka, Pṛṣṭyāmaya,
	2 fevers and rheumatic pains, 
Viṣkandha and Saṃskandha,
	3 Jambha, and so on. But it is 
also regarded as a specific against all diseases, and as the best 
of healing powers.
	4 It is said to be produced from the juices 
(rasa) of ploughing (kṛṣi),
	5 but this need only mean that it grew 
in cultivated land, not that it was itself cultivated. What plant 
the name designates is quite uncertain, for it disappears in the 
later literature. Caland

the Terminalia arjuneya. 1) ii. 4; xix. 34. 35. 2) Av. xix. 34, 10. 3) Av. ii. 4, 1; xix. 34, 1. 5. 4) Av. xix. 34, 9. 7. 5) Av. ii. 4, 5. 6) Altindisches Zauberritual, 15, render

जन
जन,
 besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a 
tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’ 
or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’ 
(Panca Janāḥ or Janāsaḥ) are frequently referred to, and in 
one hymn of the Rigveda
	1 the ‘people of Yadu’ (yādva jana) 
and the Yadus (yādvāḥ) are synonymous. Again, the king 
(rājan) is described as ‘protector (gopā) of the people (janasya),’
	2 
and there are other references to king and Jana.
	3 The people 
of the Bharatas (bhārata jana) is also mentioned;
	4 there is no 
ground to assume with Hopkins
	5 that Jana in this case means 
a clan or horde (Grāma), as distinguished from a people. 
It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided. 
Zimmer
	6 argues from a passage in the Rigveda
	7 that a people 
was divided into cantons (Viś), cantons into joint families or 
clans, or village communities (Grāma, Vṛjana), and these again 
into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are 
reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Viś, Janman, and 
Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was 
originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful 
whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The 
division of the Jana into several Viś may be regarded as 
probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage 
of the Rigveda,
	8 which mentions the Viś as a unit of the fighting 
men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient 
Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military 
arrangement. But the subdivision of the Viś into several 
Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer
	9 admits that neither Grāma
	10 
nor Vṛjana
	11 has the special sense of a subdivision of the Viś 
when used for war, for both words only denote generally an 
armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in 
Vrā
	12 and in Vrāja,
	13 but it is sufficient to say that the former 
passage is of extremely doubtful import,
	14 and that the latter 
has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state 
in what exact relation the Grāma in Vedic times stood to the 
Viś or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased 
by the vagueness of the sense of both Grāma and Viś. If the 
latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Grāma 
must have been a part of a district; but if a Viś was a unit of 
relationship, then a Grāma may have contained families of 
different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a 
Viś, or have contained only a part of a Viś. But in any 
case the original state of affairs must have been greatly 
modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitu
tion of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The 
elements of the people were represented by the family — either 
as an individual family inhabiting one home (Kula), and con
sisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a 
patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father — and 
by the clan, the later Gotra, which included all those who 
claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as 
roughly corresponding to the Latin gens and the Greek , 
and possibly the Viś may be the equivalent of the curia and , and the Jana of the tribus and  or .
	15 These 
three divisions may also be seen in the Viś, Zantu, and Daqyu 
of the Iranian world, where the use of Viś suggests that in the 
Indian Viś a relationship based on blood rather than locality is 
meant — and perhaps even in the vicus, pagus, and civitas of the 
old German polity described in the Germania
	16 of Tacitus. 
The family in some form appears as the third element of the 
Jana in a passage of the Rigveda,
	17 where the house (gṛha) is 
contrasted with the Jana and the Viś. Possibly, too, another 
passage
	18 contrasts the adhvara, or family sacrifice, with that of 
the Jana or Viś, rather than, as Zimmer
	19 thinks, the village 
with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particu
larism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a 
fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe, 
there is no sure trace
	20 of any intermediate cult between that of 
the king and that of the individual householder. The real 
elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as 
ultimately the gens and tribus, the  and  are alone 
important. It may be that Viś sometimes represents in the 
older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See Viś. 
This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the 
Brāhmaṇa period is considered. The tribe or people still exists, 
and is presupposed, but the division into Viś disappears. The 
real division is now the separate castes (Varṇa), but the 
numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to 
be based in part on the ancient Gotra. 1) viii. 6, 46. 48. 2) Rv. iii. 43, 5. So Soma is called 
gopati janasya, ‘protector of the people,’ 
Rv. ix. 35, 5. 3) Rv. v. 58, 4. 4) Rv. iii. 53, 12. See also Bharata. 
Cf. also x. 174, 5 = Av. i. 29, 6. 5) Religions of India, 26, 27. It is true 
that the Bharatas are called a gavyan 
grāmaḥ, ‘a horde eager for booty,’ in 
Rv. iii. 33, 11; but Grāma has there 
merely a general application. Seen. 10. 6) Altindisches Leben, 159, 160. 7) ii. 26, 3. 8) x. 84, 4. Viśaḥ may have the same 
sense in several other passages — iv. 24, 
4; v. 61, 1; vi. 26, 1; vii. 79, 2; 
viii. 12, 29 — but it need not necessarily 
bear this sense. But in x. 91, 2, there 
is a clear contrast between Viś and 
Jana. 9) Op. cit., 161. He also relies on 
Rv. v. 53, 11, where the Maruts are

जनशार्करक्ष्य
2. Jana Śārkarakṣya (‘descendant of Śarkarakṣa’) is 
mentioned as a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 6, 1, 1 
et seq.) and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (v. 11, 1; 15, 1). He was 
a contemporary of Aśvapati Kaikeya, and of Aruṇa Aupaveśi 
and his son Uddālaka Āruṇi.

जनक
जनक,
 king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	2 
as well as in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	3 and the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad.
	4 He was a contemporary of Yājñavalkya Vāja- 
saneya,
	5 of Śvetaketu Āruṇeya, and of other sages.
	6 He had 
become famous for his generosity and his interest in the dis
cussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality, 
in the life-time of Ajātaśatru of Kāśi.
	7 It is significant that 
he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the 
Kuru-Pañcālas, such as Yājñavalkya and Śvetaketu; for this 
indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads 
was in the Kuru-Pañcāla country rather than in the east. 
There is a statement in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	8 that he 
became a Brahmin (brahmā). This does not, however, signify 
a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became 
a Brahmin (see Kṣatriya). Janaka is occasionally mentioned 
in later texts: in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	9 he has already 
become quite mythical; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	10 
a sapta-rātra or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him. 
It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a con
temporary of Ajātaśatru, and by identifying the latter with the 
Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts:
	11 this would make the end of the 
sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka.
	12 But it is 
very doubtful whether this identification can be supported: 
Ajātaśatru was king of Kāśi, whereas Ajātasattu was king of 
Magadha, and his only connexion with Kāśi was through his 
marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala.
	13 More
over, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to 
reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for 
it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the 
Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older 
Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism.
	14 Nor do the Vedic texts know 
anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes 
famed in Buddhist records. 
The identification
	15 of Janaka of Videha and the father of 
Sītā is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is 
somewhat doubtful. In the Sūtras Janaka appears as an 
ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less 
respected than later.

जनता
जनता,

	1 and 
the Brāhmaṇas,
	2 denotes the people as a community (cf. 
Sabhā) or as a religious unit. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 4; 6, 4;

जनपद
जन-पद
 in the Brāhmaṇas denotes both the ‘people,’ as 
opposed to the king,
	1 and the ‘land’ or ‘relam.’
	2 The 
‘subjects’ are also denoted by the adjectival jānapada.

जनमेजय
1. Janam-ejaya (‘man-impelling’) is the name of a king, 
a Pārikṣita,
	1 famous towards the end of the Brāhmaṇa period. 
He is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 as owning 
horses which when wearied were refreshed with sweet drinks, 
and as a performer of the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice.
	3 His 
capital, according to a Gāthā quoted in the Śatapatha
	4 and 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇas,
	5 was Āsandīvant. His brothers 
Ugrasena, Bhīmasena, and Śrutasena are mentioned as having 
by the horse sacrifice purified themselves from sin. The priest 
who performed the sacrifice for him was Indrota Daivāpi 
Śaunaka.
	6 On the other hand the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	7 which 
also mentions his Aśvamedha, names Tura Kāvaṣeya as his 
priest. It also contains an obscure tale stating that at one 
sacrifice of his he did not employ the Kaśyapas, but the 
Bhūtavīras, being, however, induced by the Asitamṛgas to 
have recourse to the Kaśyapas again.
	8 He was a Kuru prince; 
see Parikṣit. The Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	9 tells an absurd tale 
about him, evidently as of an ancient hero. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 
1 et seq.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 34; 
viii. 11. 21; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
xvi. 8, 27, etc. 2) xi. 5, 5, 13. 3) xiii. 5, 4, 1-3. 4) xiii. 5, 4, 2. 5) viii. 21. 6) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 1;

n. 229; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 43, 345, n. 9)i. 2, 5.

जनमेजय
2. Janam-ejaya is in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 the name 
of a priest who officiated at the snake sacrifice. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

जनश्रुत
जन-श्रुत
 (‘famed among men’) Kāṇḍviya is the name of 
a pupil of Hṛtsvāśaya, mentioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) 
in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2), and of 
Vārakya, a pupil of Jayanta, referred to in the same Brāh
maṇa (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1). Cf. Jānaśruti.

जनि
जनि, जनी
 — These words appear to denote ‘wife,’ usually 
applying to her in relation to her husband (Pati). The more 
general sense of ‘woman’ is doubtful; for when Uṣas is called 
a fair Janī,
	1 ‘wife’ may be meant, and the other passage
	2 cited 
for this sense by Delbrück,
	3 which refers to the begetting of 
children, seems to demand the sense of ‘wives.’ Since the 
words usually appear in the plural,
	4 it is possible they may 
refer not to ‘wives’ proper, but to Hetairai. This is, how
ever, rendered unlikely because the Rigveda
	5 uses the phrase 
patyur janitvam, denoting ‘wifehood to a husband,’ as well 
as the expression janayo na patnīḥ,
	6 ‘like wives (who are) 
mistresses,’
	7 besides containing passages in which the word has 
reference to marriage.
	8 The singular occurs in the dialogue of 
Yama and Yamī.
	9 1) Rv. iv. 52, 1. 2) v. 61, 3. 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandschafts- 
namen, 413. 4) i. 85, 1; iv. 5, 5; 19, 5; vii. 18, 2; 
26, 3; ix. 86, 32; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xii. 35; xx. 40. 43, etc. Cf. Rv. x. 43, 1. 
In x. 110, 5, the phrase is patibhyo na 
janayaḥ, where both plurals may be 
generic 5) x. 18, 8. Cf. janitvana in viii. 2, 
42. 6) i. 62, 10; 186, 7. 7) The distinction of sense was prob
ably this: jani meant ‘wife,’ as bearing 
children (from jan, ‘beget’), while 
patnī was ‘wife,’ as being mistress 
of the house (feminine of pati, ‘lord,’ 
‘husband’). 8) v. 61, 3. So in x. 40, 10, the word 
seems certainly to refer to marriage. 9) x. 10, 3.

जनितृ
जनितृ
 
	1 and Janitrī
	2 are frequent words, in the Rigveda and 
later, for ‘father’ and ‘mother’ regarded as the ‘begetter’ 
and the ‘bearer’ respectively of the child. See Pitṛ, Mātṛ. 1) Rv. i. 129, 11; 164, 33; iii. 1, 10; 
54, 9, etc.; Av. iv. 1, 7; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xix. 87, etc. 2) Rv. iii. 48, 2; 54, 14; Av. vi. 110, 
13; ix. 5, 30, etc.

जन्तु
जन्तु,
 besides the general sense of ‘man,’ has also in a few 
passages
	1 the more restricted sense of ‘follower’ or ‘subject.’ 
The ‘followers of Śvaitreya’
	2 may be compared with the 
‘subjects (viśaḥ) of Tṛṇaskanda.’
	3 1) Rv. 1. 94, 5; x. 140, 4. 2) Rv. v. 19, 3. 3) Rv. i. 172, 3.

जन्मन्
जन्मन्
 appears to have the sense of ‘relations’ in two 
passages of the Rigveda,
	1 being used collectively in the second 
of them. 1) iii. 15, 2; ii. 26, 3 (where janena, 
viśā, janmanā, putraiḥ, is the series). 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 160, and 
see Jana and Viś.

जन्य
जन्य
 has in the Rigveda (iv. 38, 6) and the Atharvaveda 
(xi. 8, 1) the special sense of bridesman.’

जबाला
जबाला
 is the name of the mother of an illegitimate son, 
Satyakāma, in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (iv. 4, 1. 2. 4).

जभ्य
जभ्य,
 ‘snapper,’ denotes in the Atharvaveda
	1 an insect 
destructive to grain. 1) vi. 50, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 237.

जमदग्नि
जमद्-अग्नि
 is one of the somewhat mythical sages of the 
Rigveda, where he is frequently mentioned. In some passages
	1 
his name occurs in such a way as to indicate that he is the 
author of the hymn; once
	2 he is thus associated with Viśvā- 
mitra. In other passages
	3 he is merely referred to, and the 
Jamadagnis are mentioned once.
	4 In the Atharvaveda,
	5 as well 
as the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	6 and the Brāhmaṇas,
	7 he is quite a 
frequent figure. Here he appears as a friend of Viśvāmitra
	8 
and a rival of Vasiṣṭha.
	9 He owed his prosperity to his catū- 
rātra, or ‘four-night’ ritual, with which his family were also 
very successful.
	10 In the Atharvaveda
	11 Jamadagni is connected 
with Atri and Kaṇva, as well as Asita and Vitahavya. He was 
Adhvaryu priest at the proposed sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa.

जम्भ
जम्भ
 occurs twice in the Atharvaveda as the name of a 
disease or a demon of disease. In one passage
	1 it is said to be 
cured by the Jaṅgiḍa plant; in the other
	2 it is described as 
samhanuḥ, ‘bringing the jaws together.’ Weber
	3 argued from 
the Kauśika Sūtra
	4 that it was a child's ailment, especially 
‘teething.’ Bloomfield
	5 considers it to mean ‘convulsions,’ 
while Caland
	6 thinks it denotes ‘tetanus.’ Whitney
	7 decides 
for ‘lockjaw’ or ‘convulsions.’ 1) ii. 4, 2. 2) viii. 1, 16. 3) Indische Studien, 13, 142. 4) xxxii. 1. 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 283. 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen

जम्भक
जम्भक,
 as the name of a demon, presumably identical 
with the demon causing Jambha, is mentioned in the Vāja 
saneyi Saṃhitā
	1 and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.
	2 1) xxx. 16. 2) xii. 25. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āranyaka, 67, n. 7.

जयकलौहित्य
जयक लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned in a 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 
(iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Yaśasvin Jayanta Lauhitya.

जयन्त
जयन्त
 is the name of several teachers in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa: 
(a) Jayanta Pārāśarya (‘descendant of Parāśara’) is mentioned 
as a pupil of Vipaścit in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers).
	1 
(b) Jayanta Vārakya (‘descendant of Varaka’) appears in the 
same Vaṃśa
	1 as a pupil of Kubera Vārakya. His grandfather 
is also mentioned there as a pupil of Kaṃsa Vārakya. 
(c) A Jayanta Vārakya, pupil of Suyajña Śāṇḍilya, perhaps 
identical with the preceding, is found in another Vaṃśa.
	2 
(d) Jayanta is a name of Yaśasvin Lauhitya.
	3 
See also Dakṣa Jayanta Lauhitya. 1) iii. 41, 1. 1) iii. 41, 1. 2) iv. 17, 1. 3) iii. 42, 1. Not only is the forma
tion of the name a late one (cf. Whitney, 
Sanskrit Grammar, 1209d, and Mac
donell, Vedic Grammar 191a), but the 
Upaniṣad in which it occurs is also a 
late one.

जराबोध
जरा-बोध,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 is 
of doubtful meaning. It is held by Ludwig
	2 to be the name of 
a seer. Roth
	3 regards it as a mere adjective meaning ‘attending 
to the invocation,’ which is perhaps the most probable inter
pretation. Oldenburg,
	4 however, thinks that the word is a 
proper name, the literal sense being ‘alert in old age.’ 1) i. 27, 10. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 103. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Nirukta, x. 8. 4) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 23. He compares 
the ṛṣī bodha-pratibodhau of Av. v. 30, 
10.

जरायु
जरायु
 is found once in the Atharvaveda
	1 in the sense of 
a ‘serpent's skin.’ Usually
	2 it denotes the outer covering 
(chorion) of the embryo, as opposed to the ulva, the inner 
covering (amnion). 
Living things are occasionally classified according to their 
mode of origin. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	3 they are divided 
into (a) āṇḍa-ja, ‘egg-born’; (b) jīva-ja, ‘born alive,’ or born 
from the womb; (c) udbhij-ja, ‘propagated by sprouts.’ In the 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	4 the division is fourfold: (a) āṇḍa-ja; 
(b) jāru-ja, that is, jarāyu-ja (found in the Atharvaveda,
	5 and 
needlessly read here by Böhtlingk);
	6 (c) udbhij-ja; and (d) 
svcda-ja, ‘sweat-born,’ explained as ‘insects.’ 1) i. 27, 1. 2) Rv. v. 78, 8; Av. i. 11, 4; vi. 49, 1;

जरितृ
1. Jaritṛ is the regular term in the Rigveda,
	1 and occasion
ally later,
	2 for a singer of hymns of praise or worshipper. 1) i. 2, 2; 165, 14; ii. 33, 11; iii. 60, 
7, etc. 2) Av. v. 11, 8; xx. 135, 1, etc.

जरितृ
2. Jaritṛ. According to Sieg,
	1 mention is made in one 
hymn of the Rigveda
	2 of Jaritṛ, one of the Śārṅgas. That 
hymn he seeks to bring into connexion with the epic
	3 tradition 
of the Ṛṣi Mandapāla, who wedded Jaritā, a female Śārṅga 
bird — apparently a hen sparrow (caṭakā) — and had four sons. 
These being abandoned by him and exposed to the danger of 
being consumed by a forest fire, prayed to Agni with the hymn 
Rigveda x. 142. This interpretation is very doubtful, though 
Sāyaṇa
	4 appears to have adopted it. 1) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 44 et seq. 2) x. 142. 3) Mahābhārata, i. 222, 1 et seq. 4) On Rv. x. 142, 7. 8.

जरूथ
जरूथ,
 mentioned in three passages of the Rigveda,
	1 
appears to denote a demon defeated by Agni.
	2 Ludwig, how
ever, followed by Griffith,
	3 sees in him a foe slain in a battle in 
which Vasiṣṭha, the traditional author of the seventh Maṇḍala 
of the Rigveda, was Purohita, or domestic priest. 1) vii. 1, 7; 9, 6; x. 80. 3. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Nirukta, vi. 17. 3) Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 11, n.

जर्तिल
जर्तिल,
 ‘wild sesamum,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā (v. 4, 3, 2) as an unsuitable sacrificial offering. In 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 1, 1, 3) sesamum seeds are 
regarded as combining the qualities of cultivation (viz., 
edibility) with those of wild growth (because they are produced 
on unploughed land).

जर्वर
जर्वर
 was Gṛhapati or ‘householder’ at the snake festival 
described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

जलजातूकर्ण्य
जल जातूकर्ण्य
 (‘descendant of Jātūkarṇa’), is mentioned in 
the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 29, 6) as having obtained 
the position of Purohita, or domestic priest, of the three peoples 
or kings of Kāśi, Videha, and Kosala.

जलाषभेषज
जलाष-भेषज,
 ‘whose remedy is Jalāṣa,’ is an epithet of 
Rudra in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda.
	2 The word 
Jālāṣa occurs in a hymn of the Atharvaveda,
	3 where it denotes 
a remedy, perhaps, for a tumour or boil.
	4 The commentator 
on this passage and the Kauśika Sūtra
	5 regard Jālāṣa as 
meaning ‘urine,’ which seems a probable interpretation.
	6 But 
Geldner
	7 thinks that rain-water, conceived as urine, is meant; 
and the Naighaṇṭuka
	8 identifies jalāṣa and udaka ‘water.’ 1) i. 43, 4; viii. 29, 5. 2) ii. 27, 6. It also occurs in the 
Nīlarudra Upaniṣad (a very late work), 
3, and jalāṣa as an adjective is found in 
Rv. ii. 33, 7; viii. 33, 6. 3) vi. 57. 4) Bloomfield, American Journal of 
Philology, 11, 321 et seq.; Hymns of the

जष
जष
 is the name of some aquatic animal or fish in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
	2 The commentary 
on the latter text explains it by makara, probably meaning 
‘dolphin.’ The word also occurs in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.
	3 
Cf. Jhaṣa. 1) xi. 2, 25. There are various read
ings: jhaṣa, jakha, jagha. 2) v. 5, 13, 1. 3) ii. 2, 5.

जहका
जहका,
 the ‘polecat,’ is mentioned as a victim at the 
Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda.
	1 Sāyaṇa
	2 
thinks it means a jackal living in holes (vila-vāsī kroṣṭā). 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 18, 1;

जह्नु
जह्नु
 occurs only in the plural in the legend of Śunaḥśepa, 
who is said to have obtained, as Devarāta, both the lordship 
of the Jahnus and the divine lore of the Gāthins.
	1 A Jāhnava, 
or descendant of Jahnu, was, according to the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 Viśvāmitra, who is said, by means of a certain 
catū-rātra or ‘four-night’ ritual, to have secured the kingdom 
for the Jahnus in their conflict with the Vṛcīvants. He is 
here described as a king. Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 
Viśvāmitra is addressed as a rāja-putra, ‘prince,’ and Bharata- 
rṣabha, ‘bull of the Bharatas.’ It is therefore clear that the 
Brāhmaṇas, though not the Saṃhitās, saw in him at once a 
priest and a prince by origin, though there is no trace whatever 
of their seeing in him a prince who won Brahmanhood as in 
the version of the later texts.
	4 
A Jahnāvī is mentioned twice in the Rigveda,
	5 being either 
the wife of Jahnu, or, as Sāyaṇa thinks, the race of Jahnu. 
The family must clearly once have been a great one, later 
merged in the Bharatas. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18 (Jah- 
nūnām cādhipatye daive vede ca Gāthinām); 
Asvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xii. 14; 
Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 27 (p. 195, 
1. 21, ed. Hillebrandt, where the read
ing is different and the sense altered: 
Jahnūnāṃ cādhitasthire daive vede ca 
Gāthinaḥ. The two ca's cannot be 
justified, and the text must be in
correct). 2) xxi. 12. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions 
of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 54, who correctly explains 
the passage which Sāyaṇa misunder
stands. 3) vii. 17, 6, 7. 4) Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1, 337 et seq. 5) i. 116, 19; iii. 58, 6. Cf. Ludwig,

जातशाकायन्य
जात शाकायन्य
 (‘descendant of Śāka’) is mentioned as a 
ritual authority and contemporary of Śaṅkha in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā (xxii. 7).

जातरूप
जात-रूप,
 ‘possessing native beauty,’ is the name of ‘gold’ 
in the later Brāhmaṇas
	1 and the Sūtras.
	2 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 13 (jāta- 
rūpa-maya, ‘composed of gold’); 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 25; 
Naighaṇṭuka, i. 2. 2) Rajata-jātarūpe, ‘silver and gold,’ 
Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 6, 24. Cf. 
viii. 1, 3; Kauśika Sūtra, x. 16; 
xiii. 3, etc.; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
iii. 19, 9.

जाति
जाति,
 which in the Pāli
	1 texts is the word denoting ‘caste,’ 
does not occur at all in the early Vedic literature; when it is 
found, as in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	2 it has only the 
sense of ‘family’ (for which cf. Kula, Gotra, and Viś). For 
the influence of the family system on the growth of caste, see 
Varṇa. To assume that it was the basis of caste, as does 
Senart,
	3 is difficult in face of the late appearance of words for 
family and of stress on family.

जातूकर्ण्य
जातू-कर्ण्य,
 ‘descendant of Jātūkarṇa,’ is the patronymic 
of several persons. 
(a) A pupil of Āsurāyaṇa and Yāska bears this name in 
a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad in 
the Kāṇva recension.
	1 In the Mādhyaṃdina
	2 he is a pupil 
of Bhāradvāja. 
(b) A Kātyāyanī-putra, ‘son of Kātyāyanī,’ bears this name 
in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.
	3 
(c) A Jātūkarṇya is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	4 
as a contemporary of Alīkayu Vācaspatya and other sages. 
(d) Jātūkarṇya is in the Sūtras
	5 frequently a patronymic of 
teachers whose identity cannot be determined. The same 
person or different persons may here be meant. 1) ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3. 2) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27. 3) viii. 10. 4) xxvi. 5 (Jātukarṇya in Lindner's 
index, 159, is a misprint). 5) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3; Śāṅkh

जातूष्ठिर
जातू-ष्ठिर
 occurs in one verse of the Rigveda
	1 where 
Sāyaṇa and Ludwig
	2 interpret the word as a proper name. 
Roth
	3 renders it as an adjective meaning ‘naturally powerful.’
	4 1) ii. 13, 11. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. (with 
a wrong reference, ii. 23, 11). 4) Urkräftig. Grassmann, Wörterbuch, 
similarly explains the word as ‘power
ful by nature or birth’ (jātū).

जान
जान,
 ‘descendant of Jana,’ is the patronymic of Vṛśa in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 and apparently in the Śāṭyāyanaka.
	2 1) xiii. 3, 12. 2) In Sāyaṇa on Rv. v. 5. Cf. Bṛhad
devatā, v. 14 et seq., with Macdonell's 
notes; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda,

जानक
जानक,
 ‘descendant of Janaka,’ is the patronymic of 
Kratuvid in some MSS. of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 In the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	2 the name appears instead as Kratujit 
Jānaki. Jānaka is also, according to some manuscripts of the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	3 the patronymic of Āyasthūṇa, but 
is here no doubt a misreading of Jānaki. 1) vii. 34. 2) ii. 3, 8, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 1. 3) vi. 3, 10 (Kāṇva).

जानकि
जानकि,
 ‘descendant of Janaka,’ is the patronymic of 
Kratujit in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	1 of Kratuvid in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 and of Āyasthūṇa in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	3 
where he is mentioned as a pupil of Cūḍa Bhāgavitti, and as 
teacher of Satyakāma Jābāla. 1) ii. 3, 8, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 1. 2) vii. 34. 3) vi. 3, 10 (Kāṇva = vi. 3, 18. 19, Mādhyaṃdina).

	2 Ulukya,
	3 Nagarin,
	4 and Sāyaka.

जाबाल
जाबाल,
 ‘descendant of Jabāla,’ is the metronymic of Mahā- 
śāla
	1 and Satyakāma.
	2 Jābāla is also mentioned as a teacher 
in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,
	3 which refers to the 
Jābālas
	4 as well. The Jābāla Gṛhapatis are spoken of in the 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.

teacher, a pupil of Mādhyaṃdināyana, who is mentioned in 
the second Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Kāṇva recension of 
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 6, 2).

जामदग्निय
जामदग्निय
 is the patronymic of two ‘descendants of 
Jamadagni’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
	1 It appears from the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 that the Aurvas are meant, and that 
Jamadagni's descendants were ever prosperous. 1) vii. 1, 9, 1. 2) xxi. 10, 6. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 12, 251, n.; 
Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut 
Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54.

जामातृ
जामातृ
 is a rare word denoting ‘son-in-law’ in the Rigveda,
	1 
where also occurs the word Vijāmātṛ, denoting an ‘unsatis
factory son-in-law,’ as one who does not pay a sufficient price, 
or one who, having other defects, must purchase a bride. 
Friendly relations between son-in-law and father-in-law are 
referred to in the Rigveda.
	2 1) viii. 2, 20. Vāyu is called the 
jāmātṛ of Tvaṣṭṛ in viii. 26, 21. 22. 
Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Ver- 
wandtschaftsnamen, 517; Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 78, 79. 2) x. 28, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Journal 
of the American Oriental Society, 15, 
255.

जामि
जामि,
 a word which appears originally to have meant 
‘related in blood,’ is not rarely used as an epithet of ‘sister’ 
(Svasṛ), and sometimes even denotes ‘sister’ itself, the 
emphasis being on the blood-relationship.
	1 So it appears in 
a passage of the Atharvaveda,
	2 where ‘brotherless sisters’ 
(abhrātara iva jāmayaḥ) are referred to. The word is similarly 
used in the dispute occurring in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 as to 
the precedence of Rākā, or of the wives of the gods, in a certain 
rite. One party is there described as holding that the sister 
should be preferred (jāmyai vai pūrva-peyam) — apparently at a 
ceremonial family meal — to the wife, presumably as being of 
one blood with the husband, while the wife is not (being anyo- 
daryā, ‘of another womb’).
	4 In the neuter
	5 the word means 
‘relationship,’ like jāmi-tva, which also occurs in the Rigveda.
	6 1) Cf. Delbrück, Dic indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 463, 464. As ‘rela
tion,’ it occurs, e.g., Rv. i. 31, 10; 
75, 3. 4; 100, 11; 124, 6, etc.; as 
‘sister,’ Rv. i. 65, 7; x. 10, 10, etc.; 
with svasā, i. 123, 5; 185, 5; iii. 1, 11; 
ix. 65, 1; 89, 4, etc. 2) i. 17, 1. 3) iii. 37. 4) Delbrück, loc. cit. 5) Rv. iii. 54, 9; x. 10, 4; jāmi-kṛt, 
‘making relationship,’ Av. iv. 19, 1. 
Cf. Altareya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. 6) i. 105, 9; 166, 13; x. 55, 4; 64, 13.

जामिशंस
जामि-शंस,
 the ‘imprecation by a sister’ or ‘relation,’ is 
mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	1 showing that family disputes 
were not rare. This is also indicated by the word Bhrātṛvya, 
which, while properly meaning ‘father's brother's son,’ regularly 
denotes simply ‘enemy.’ 1) ii. 10, 1 (= Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 6, 3), and personified in ix. 4, 15. 
Cf. jāmyāḥ śapathaḥ, Av. ii. 7, 2; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 362.

जाम्बिल
जाम्बिल,
 ‘hollow of the knee,’
	1 occurs once in the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā
	2 The word also occurs in the form of Jāmbīla in the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	3 and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	4 Mahīdhara, 
in his commentary on the latter text, interprets the word as 
‘knee-pan,’ which he says is so named because of its resemblance 
to the citron, jāmbīra. 1) Perhaps for jānu-bila. Cf. Mac
donell, Vedic Grammar, p. 11, n. 4. 2) iii. 15, 3. 3) v. 13, 1. 4) xxv. 3.

जायन्तीपुत्र
जायन्ती-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Jāyantī,’ is mentioned in the last 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	1 as a 
pupil of Māṇḍūkāyanīputra. 1) vi. 5, 2 (Kāṇva = vi. 4, 32 Mādhyaṃdina).

जाया
जाया
 regularly denotes ‘wife,’ and, as opposed to Patnī, wife 
as an object of marital affection, the source of the continuance 
of the race.
	1 So it is used of the wife of the gambler, and of 
the wife of the Brāhmaṇa in the Rigveda;
	2 it is also frequently 
combined with Pati, ‘husband,’
	3 both there and in the later 
literature.
	4 Patnī, on the other hand, is used to denote the 
wife as partner in the sacrifice;
	5 when no share in it is assigned 
to her, she is called Jāyā.
	6 The distinction is, of course, 
merely relative; hence one text
	7 calls Manu's wife Jāyā, 
another
	8 Patnī. Later on Jāyā is superseded by Dāra. 1) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Ver- 
wandtschaftsnamen, 411, 412. Cf. Rv. 
i. 105, 2; 124, 7; iii. 53, 4; iv. 3, 2; 
18, 3; ix. 82, 4; x. 10, 7; 17, 1; 71, 4, 
etc.; Av. iii. 30, 2; vi. 60, 1, etc. 2) x. 34, 2. 3. 13, and x. 109. 3) Rv. iv. 3, 2; x. 149, 4. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 23, 1. Cf. 
vii. 13, 10; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
iv. 6, 7, 9. Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,

जायान्य
जायान्य,
 
	1 Jāyenya,
	2 are variant forms of the name of a 
disease mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā. In one passage of the former text
	3 it is mentioned with 
jaundice (harimā) and pains in the limbs (aṅga-bhedo visalpakaḥ). 
Zimmer
	4 thinks these are its symptoms, and identifies it with a 
kind of Yakṣma, or disease of the lungs. Bloomfield
	5 prefers 
to identify it with syphilis, in accordance with certain indica
tions in the ritual of the Kauśika Sūtra.
	6 Roth conjectures 
‘gout,’ but Whitney
	7 leaves the nature of the disease doubtful. 1) Av. vii. 76, 3-5; xix. 44, 2. 2) ii. 3, 5, 2; 5, 6, 5. 3) xix. 44, 2. 4) Altindisches Leben, 377, following

जार
जार,
 ‘lover,’ has no sinister sense in the early texts
	1 
generally, where the word applies to any lover. But it seems 
probable that the Jāra at the Puruṣamedha, or human sacrifice,
	2 
must be regarded as an illegitimate lover; this sense also 
appears in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	3 and Indra is styled 
the lover of Ahalyā, wife of Gautama
	4 1) Rv. i. 66, 8; 117, 18; 134, 3; 
152, 4; ix. 32, 5, etc. The word is 
often used mythologically, as, e.g., jāra 
uṣasām, ‘lover of the dawns,’ vii. 9, 
1. Cf Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
308. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 9; Tait

जारत्कारव
जारत्-कारव
 (‘descendant of Jaratkāru’) Ārtabhāga (‘de
scendant of Ṛtabhāga’) is the name of a teacher mentioned 
in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (vii. 20) and the Bṛhadāranyaka 
Upaniṣad (iii. 2, 1, in both recensions).

जारु
जारु
 See Jarāyu.

जाल
जाल
 occurs in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Sūtras
	2 in the sense 
of ‘net.’ Jālaka is used in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	3 of a 
reticulated membrane resembling a woven covering. 1) viii. 8. 5. 3 (as used against foes); 
x. 1, 30. 2) Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, vii. 4, 7. 
etc. 3) iv. 2, 3.

 is the name of an unknown animal in the Athar
vaveda.

जास्पति
जास्-पति
 occurs once in the Rigveda
	1 in the sense of the 
‘head of the family.’ The abstract formed from this word, 
Jās-patya, apparently denoting ‘lordship of children,’ is also 
found there.
	2 1) i. 135. 8. 2) Rv. v. 28, 3; x. 85, 23.

जाहुष
जाहुष
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 of a protégé of the 
Aśvins. 1) i. 116, 10; vii. 71, 5 Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159.

जाह्नव
जाह्नव,
 ‘descendant of Jahnu,’ is the patronymic of Viśvā- 
mitra in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 This fact is of some 
importance as disproving Aufrecht's theory
	2 that the Jahnus 
were the clan of Ajīgarta the father of Śunaḥśepa. 1) xxi. 12. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
1, 32; Hopkins, Transactions of the Con- 
necticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 
54. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 424.

जित्वन्शैलिनि
जित्वन् शैलिनि
 is the name of a teacher in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad,
	1 a contemporary of Janaka and Yājñavalkya. He 
held that speech (vāc) was Brahman. 1) iv. 1, 2 (Kāṇva = iv. 1, 5 Mādhyaṃdina, which has Śailina as the patronymic).

जिह्वावन्त्बाध्योग
जिह्वावन्त् बाध्योग
 is the name, in the last Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	1 of a teacher, pupil 
of Asita Vārṣāgaṇa. 1) vi. 5, 3 (Kāṇva = vi. 4, 33 Mādhyaṃdina).

जीवगृभ्
जीव-गृभ्,
 ‘seizing alive,’ is, according to Roth,
	1 the term 
for a police official in the Rigveda.
	2 But although this sense 
is rendered possible by the mention of Madhyamaśī, perhaps 
‘arbitrator,’ in the same passage,
	3 it is neither necessary nor 
probable.

जीवत्|जीवन्त्
जीवन्त्
 appears to denote a certain plant in one passage of

	1 where the edition of Roth and Whitney has 
the unjustified emendation Jīvala.
	2 1) xix. 39, 3. Cf. Whitney, Transla
tion of the Atharvaveda, 960. 2) With this conjectural form, cf.

जीवलचल्लकि
जीवल चल्लकि,
 ‘descendant of Celaka,’ is mentioned in the

	1 as reproving Takṣan. 1) ii. 3, 1, 31-35. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du Sacrifice, 140.

जुहू
जुहू
 is the regular name in the Rigveda and later for the 
tongue-shaped ladle in which butter was offered to the gods. 
1) Rv. viii. 44, 5; x. 21, 3; Av. xviii. 4, 5. 6, etc.

जूर्णि
जूर्णि,
 ‘firebrand,’ is regarded by Zimmer
	1 as one of the 
weapons of the Vedic Indians. But since it is only mentioned 
in the Rigveda
	2 as a weapon used by demons, its employment 
in normal war cannot be safely assumed. 1) Altindisches Leben, 301. 2) i. 129, 8. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 4.

जूर्णी
जूर्णी
 is one of the names given to serpents in a hymn of the 
Atharvaveda (ii. 24, 5), perhaps from their habit of casting 
their slough. See Ahi.

जेतृ
जेतृ

जैत्रायणसहोजित्
जैत्रायण सहो-जित्
 is apparently in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	1 
the name of a prince who celebrated the Rājasūya, or ‘royal 
consecration.’ Von Schroeder
	2 quotes in support of Jaitrā
yaṇa as a proper name the derivative Jaitrāyaṇi, ‘descendant 
of Jaitra,’ formed according to the Gaṇa karṇādi, which is 
referred to by Pāṇini;
	3 but it should be noted that in the 
parallel passage of the Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā
	4 the reading is 
different, and no proper personal name appears, the subject 
being Indra, the god. This reading seems much more probable, 
for the verse should be general, and suit every king performing 
the rite. 1) xviii. 5. 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
lāndischen Gesellschaft, 49, 168. 3) iv. 2, 80. 4) xxviii. 5, cited by von Schroeder

जैवन्तायन
जैवन्तायन,
 ‘descendant of Jīvanta,’ is mentioned in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	1 as a teacher, with Śaunaka and 
Raibhya, of Rauhiṇāyana. 1) iv. 5, 26 (Mādhyaṃdina). The name is recognised by Pāṇini, iv. 1, 103.

जैवल
जैवल
 or Jaivali, ‘descendant of Jīvala,’ is the patronymic 
of Pravāhaṇa in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
	1 and Chāndogya Upani
ṣads.
	2 Jaivali, the king, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	3 
is the same person. 1) vi. 2, 1 (Kāṇva = vi. 1, 1 Mādhyaṃ
dina), where the form is Jaivala. 2) i. 8, 1. 2. 8; v. 3, 1. 3) i. 38, 4.

ज्ञातृ
ज्ञातृ
 occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda
	1 and one 
of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	2 with a somewhat obscure sense. 
Zimmer
	3 conjectures not unnaturally that the word is a 
technical term taken from law, meaning ‘witness.’ The 
reference is, perhaps, to a custom of carrying on transactions 
of business before witnesses as practised in other primitive 
societies.
	4 Roth
	5 suggests that the word has the sense of 
‘surety.’ But Bloomfield
	6 and Whitney
	7 ignore these inter
pretations. 1) vi. 32, 3; viii. 8, 21. 2) xii. 14. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka, 66, n. 4. 3) Altindisches Leben, 181. 4) In Manu, viii. 57, the word is a 
various reading for sākṣin, ‘witness.’

ज्ञाति
ज्ञाति
 (masc.), a word which originally seems to have meant 
‘acquaintance,’
	1 denotes in the Rigveda
	2 and later
	3 a ‘relation,’ 
apparently one who was connected by blood on the father's 
side, though the passages do not necessarily require the 
limitation. But this sense follows naturally enough from the 
patriarchal basis of Vedic society.
	4 1) Being in all probability derived 
from jñā, ‘know,’ not from jan, ‘beget,’ 
as would at first sight seem more likely 
on account of the sense. Cf. the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) vii. 55, 5, seems to refer to the 
members of the joint family sleeping 
in the paternal house; x. 66, 14; 85, 
28 (the kinsmen of the bride are 
meant); 117, 9 (perhaps ‘brother and 
sister’ are meant by jñātī here, but 
‘kinsfolk’ will do; of. Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 5, 432). 3) Av. xii. 5, 44 (where Whitney in 
his Translation renders the word by 
‘acquaintances,’ which seems too vague 
and feeble); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 
5, 2; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 3 
(jñātibhyāṃ vā sakhibhyāṃ, vā, ‘where 
‘relations’ are contrasted with ‘friends’ 
or ‘companions’); ii. 2, 2, 20; 5, 2, 
20; xi. 3, 3, 7, etc. 4) For the transition from the etymo
logical meaning, cf. , 
which in Homer designate ‘brother’ 
and ‘sister’; St. Petersburg Dic

ज्या
ज्या
 is the regular word for ‘bowstring’ in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 The making of bowstrings was a special craft, as 
is shown by the occurrence of the Jyā-kāra, or ‘maker of bow
strings,’ among the victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human 
sacrifice, in the Yajurveda.
	3 The bowstring consisted of a 
thong of ox-hide.
	4 It was not usually kept taut,
	5 but was 
specially tightened when the bow was to be used.
	6 The sound 
of the bowstring (jyā-ghoṣa) is referred to in the Atharvaveda.
	7 
Cf. Ārtnī. 1) iv. 27, 3; vi. 75, 3; x. 51, 6, etc. 2) Av. i. 1, 3; v. 13, 6; vi. 42, 1; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 9; xxix. 51, 
etc. 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 7; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 3, 1. 4) Rv. vi. 75, 3; Av. i. 1, 3. In the 
Epic the bowstring is made of hemp 
(maurvī); Hopkins, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 13, 271. 5) Av. vi. 42, 1. 6) Rv. x. 166, 3. 7) v. 21, 9.

ज्याका
ज्याका
 means ‘bowstring,’ with a contemptuous sense, in the 
Rigveda,
	1 and in the simple sense in the Atharvaveda.
	2 1) x. 133, 1, where anyakeṣāṃ jyākāḥ is unmistakably contemptuous. Cf. 
Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 137. 2) i. 2, 2.

ज्यापाश
ज्या-पाश
 means ‘bowstring’ in the Atharvaveda (xi. 10, 22).

ज्याह्रोड
ज्या-ह्रोड
 occurs in the description of the arms of the 
Vrātya in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and is also mentioned 
in the Sūtras.
	2 The sense is somewhat obscure, for one Sūtra 
describes it as a ‘bow not meant for use’ (ayogyaṃ dhanus),
	3 
while the other speaks of it as a ‘bow without an arrow’ 
(dhanuṣka aniṣu).
	4 Some sort of a bow, therefore, seems to be 
meant. 1) xvii. 1, 14 (spelt -hṇoḍa in text, 
-hnoḍa in comm.). 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxii. 4, 
11 (spelt -hroḍa); Lāṭyāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, viii. 6, 8 (spelt -hnoḍa: the editor 
notes that the Drāhyāyaṇa Sūtra has 
the same reading). 3) Kātyāyana, loc. cit. 4) Lāṭyāyana, loc. cit.

Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut 
Acad my of Arts and Sciences, 15, 32; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 33, 52.

ज्येष्ठ
ज्येष्ठ,
 ordinarily meaning ‘greatest,’ has further the 
specific sense of ‘eldest’
	1 brother in the Rigveda.
	2 It also 
means the eldest among sons, which is another side of the 
same sense.
	3 1) With changed accent, jyeṣṭhá. Cf. 
Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, p. 83, 14. 2) iv. 33, 5; x. 11, 2. 3) Av. xii. 2, 35; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
vii. 17; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 
3, 8, and cf. Jyaiṣthineya.

ज्येष्ठघ्नी
ज्येष्ठ-घ्नी,
 ‘slaying the eldest,’ is the name of a Nakṣatra, 
or lunar mansion, usually called Jyeṣṭhā, in the Atharvaveda
	1 
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 It is Antares or Cor Scipionis. 1) vi. 110, 2. Cf. vi. 112, 1. 2) i. 5, 2, 8. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 361.

ज्येष्ठा
ज्येष्ठा
 See Nakṣatra.

ज्यैष्ठिनेय
ज्यैष्ठिनेय
 denotes, in combination with Jyeṣṭha, the 
eldest,’ a ‘son of the father's first wife’ (jyeṣṭhā), in the Brāh
maṇas.
	1 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 8, 1 (opposed to haniṣṭha and hāniṣṭhineya); 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2; xx. 5, 2.

ज्योतिष
ज्योतिष,
 ‘astronomy.’ It is important to note that no refer
ence to any work on astronomy occurs in the Saṃhitās or 
Brāhmaṇas. The text which claims to represent the astro
nomical science of the Veda has been edited by Weber,
	1 and 
has frequently been discussed since.
	2 Its date is unknown, but 
is undoubtedly late, as is shown alike by the contents and form 
of the work. 1) Ueber den Vedakalender namens 
Jyotiṣam (1862). 2) See references in Thibaut, Astren- 
omie, Astrologie und Mathematik, 20, 29.

ज्वालायन
ज्वालायन,
 ‘descendant of Jvāla,’ is the name of a man, a 
pupil of Gauṣūkti, mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa (iv. 16, 1), in a list of teachers.

झष
झष
 is mentioned in the story of Manu told in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where it means a ‘great fish’ (mahā-matsya) 
according to the commentator. Eggeling
	2 suggests that a 
horned fish is meant, because in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 the 
Iḍā, or personified libation, is represented as a cow, and this 
may have brought in the idea of a horned fish in the later form 
of an old legend. But cf. Jaṣa. 1) i. 8, 1, 4. 2) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 217, n. 3; 26, xxxi. 3) i. 7, 1; ii. 6, 7.

तकवान
तकवान
 appears to be a patronymic from Taku,
	1 and to be 
the name of a seer in the Rigveda,
	2 presumably a descendant of 
Taku Kakṣīvant, for his name occurs in a group of hymns 
composed by the Kākṣīvatas.
	3 1) Cf. Bhṛgavāṇa, from Bhṛgu; Roth, 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Taku, 
as an adjective(?), occurs in Rigveda,

तक्मन्
तक्मन्
 is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Athar
vaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject 
of five hymns
	1 of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned else
where.
	2 Weber
	3 first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann
	4 
showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment.
	5 Refer
ence is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the 
patient,
	6 to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies 
the fever,
	7 and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to 
describe its varieties are anye-dyuḥ,
	8 ubhaya-dyuḥ,
	9 tṛtīyaka,
	10 
vi-tṛtīya,
	11 and sadaṃ-di,
	12 the exact sense of most of which 
terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed
	13 that the first 
epithet designates the fever known as quotidianus, which recurs 
each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit. 
‘on the other — i.e., next, day’). The ubhaya-dyuḥ (‘on both 
days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two suc
cessive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the rhythmus 
quartanus complicatus.
	14 But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a 
fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The tṛtīyaka, 
however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever,
	15 though Zimmer
	16 suggests 
that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm. 
Grohmann
	17 regards the vi-tṛtīyaka as equivalent to the tertiana 
duplicata, a common form in southern countries, in which the 
fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time 
or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield
	18 suggests 
that it is identical with the ubhaya-dyuḥ variety. The sadaṃ-di
	19 
type appears to be the kind later known as saṃtata-jvara 
(‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’ 
duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack. 
Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn (śārada), in 
the hot weather (graiṣma), in the rains (vārṣika),
	20 but was 
especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet 
viśva-śārada, ‘occurring every autumn.’
	21 
The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters.
	22 
From this Weber
	23 deduced that it was considered to be the 
result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on 
marshy land. Grohmann
	24 preferred to see in this connexion 
of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters
	25 
an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the 
time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain. 
Zimmer.
	26 who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence 
of fever in the Terai, and interprets vanya, an epithet of fever 
found in the Atharvaveda,
	27 as meaning ‘sprung from the 
forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among 
the Mūjavants and Mahāvṛṣas, two mountain tribes of the 
western Himālaya.
	28 There is no trace of fever having been 
observed to be caused by the bite of the anopheles mosquito, 
which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason 
been held to be known to classical Indian medicine.
	29 
Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications 
accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ (Pāman), ‘headache’ 
(śīrṣa-śoka),
	30 ‘cough’ (Kāsikā), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps 
some form of itch (Balāsa). 
It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear 
until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic 
Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease, 
which would take some generations to become endemic and 
recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it 
is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells 
and the Kuṣṭha, which can hardly have been an effective 
remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in 
the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would 
not be mentioned so prominently. 1) i. 25; v. 22; vi. 20; vii. 116; 
xix. 39 (cf. v. 4). 2) Av. iv. 9, 8; v. 4. 1. 9; 30, 16; 
ix. 8, 6; xi. 2, 22. 26, etc. 3) Indische Studien, 4, 119; Roth, Zur 
Litteratur und Geschishte des Weda, 39, 
had, from the use of Kuṣṭha as a 
remedy, regarded it as denoting 
‘leprosy,’ and was followed by Pictet, 
Kuhn's Zeitschrift 5, 337. Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 4, 280, thought ‘consumption’ 
was meant. 4) Indische Studien, 9, 381 et seq. 5) See also Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 451 et seq.; Zimmer, Altin-

medicine, Wise, Hindu System of

paroxysm occurs every fourth day, 
and lasts for two days. 15) Sāyaṇa on Av. i. 25, 4; Bloom

1. Takṣan, ‘carpenter,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and 
often later.
	2 He was employed to do all sorts of work in 
wood, such as the making of chariots (Ratha) and wagons 
(Anas). Carved work of a finer type seems also to have fallen 
to his lot.
	3 The axe (kuliśa,
	4 paraśu)
	5 is mentioned as one of 
his tools, and perhaps the Bhurij, a word which is, however, 
uncertain in sense. In one passage of the Rigveda
	6 reference 
seems to be made to the pains of the carpenter in bending 
over his work. That the carpenters were a low caste, or 
formed a separate class of the people, is certainly not true of 
Vedic times.

 appears properly to mean ‘thread,’ and in particular 
the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, as opposed to Otu, the ‘woof.’ 
Both senses are found in the Atharvaveda.
	1 In the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 the ‘warp’ is called anuchāda, the ‘woof’ paryāsa, 
the tantavaḥ being the ‘threads.’ In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	3 
on the other hand, the ‘warp’ is prācīna-tāna, the ‘woof’ otu. 
The threads or cords of the throne (Pary ṅka) are referred to 
in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.
	4 
In the Rigveda the word is used only metaphorically, and 
this is its most frequent use even in the Brāhmanas.
	5 See 
also Vāṇa. 1) xiv. 2, 51 (opposed to otu); xv. 3, 6 
(the prāñcaḥ and tiryañcaḥ threads or 
cords of the throne of the Vrātya 
[Āsandī]). 2) iii. 1, 2, 18; Eggeling, Sacred Books 
of the East, 26, 8, 9. 3) vi. 1, 1, 4. 4) i. 5; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 
20, n. 2. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. It 
is applied to the filaments of plants in 
Rv. x. 134, 5; to the spider's web in 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upanisad. ii. 1, 23.

तन्त्र
तन्त्र
 means, like Tantu, the ‘warp’ of a piece of weaving, 
or more generally the ‘web’ itself. It is found in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 1) x. 71, 9. 2) Av. x. 7, 42; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,

तपस्
तपस्, तपस्य
 See Māsa.

तपोनित्य
तपो-नित्य
 (‘constant in penance’) Pauru-śiṣṭi (‘descendant 
of Puruśiṣṭa’) is the name of a teacher in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad 
(i. 9, 1) who believed in the value of penance (tapas).

तयादर
तयादर
 is the name of an animal only mentioned in the 
adjectival form tāyādara along with Parasvant, ‘wild ass’(?) 
in the Atharvaveda.
	1 1) vi. 72, 2. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 335.

तरक्षु
तरक्षु,
 the ‘hyæna,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at 
the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1, 
where Sāyaṇa explains the animal to 
be ‘a kind of tiger with an ass's 
appearance’ (vyāghra-viśeṣo gardabhā- 
kāraḥ); Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 40. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81.

तरन्त
तरन्त
 appears, along with Purumīḍha, as a patron of 
Śyāvāśva in the Rigveda.
	1 In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 
and other Brāhmaṇas
	3 he, together with Purumīḍha, is de
scribed as receiving gifts from Dhvasra
	4 and Puruṣanti; but 
since the receipt of gifts was forbidden to Kṣatriyas, they for 
the nonce became Ṛṣis, and composed a passage in honour 
of the donors.
	4 He, like Purumīḍha, was a Vaidadaśvi, or 
son of Vidadaśva.
	5 1) v. 61, 10. 2) xiii. 7, 12. 3) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 139; Śāṭy
āyanaka apud Sāyaṇa on Rv. ix. 38, 3 
= Sāmaveda, ii. 410. 4) Rv. ix. 58, 3. 4) Rv. ix. 58. 3. 5) Cf. Rv. v. 61, 10; notes 2 and 3. 
This is merely a misunderstanding of 
the Rv. Cf. Oertel, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 18, 39; Sieg, 
Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq.; 
62, 63; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der 
Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 
42, 232, n. 1; Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 353, 
354, where he points out that the 
Brāhmaṇa tradition, and that of the 
Bṛhaddevatā (v. 50-81, with Macdonell's 
notes), are not to be accepted as real 
explanations of the Rigveda.

तरु
तरु,
 the usual term for ‘tree’ in classical Sanskrit, never 
occurs in Vedic literature, except perhaps in one passage of 
the Rigveda,
	1 where Sāyaṇa finds it, and where it can be so 
translated. But the form (tarubhiḥ) is probably to be inter
preted otherwise.
	2 1) v. 44, 5. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v., cites tarobhiḥ in Rv. ii. 39, 3, as 
a parallel, and so Oldenberg, Ṛgveda- 
Noten, 1, 341.

तरुक्ष
तरुक्ष
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda
	1 who is 
mentioned along with Balbūtha, the Dāsa, in a Dāna-stuti, or 
‘Praise of Gifts.’ 1) viii. 46, 32. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391; Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 117.

तर्कु
तर्कु,
 ‘spindle,’ is known only in Vedic literature from the 
mention of it in Yāska's Nirukta (ii. 1) as an example of the 
transposition of letters, the word being derived, according to 
him, from the root kart, ‘to spin.’

तर्द
तर्द,
 ‘borer,’ occurs in a hymn of the Atharvaveda
	1 enumerat
ing insects that injure grain. Whitney
	2 suggests that a kind of 
mouse or rat may be meant. Roth
	3 thought a bird was denoted. 1) vi. 50, 1. 2. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
318. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharva- 
veda, 485.

तर्द्मन्
तर्द्मन्
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 applies to the hole in the yoke 
(Yuga). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 it designates a hole in a 
skin. 1) xiv. 1, 40. 2) iii. 2, 1, 2; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 26, n. 1.

तर्य
तर्य
 is, according to Sāyaṇa, the name of a man in one 
passage of the Rigveda.
	1 But the verse is hopelessly obscure.
	2 1) v, 44, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158, 159. 2) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 342.

तलाश
तलाश
 is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Whitney
	2 
suggests that it may be the same as tālīśa (Flacourtia cata- 
phracta). 1) vi. 15, 3. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62.

तल्प
तल्प
 is the regular term for ‘bed’ or ‘couch’ from the 
Rigveda and the Atharvaveda
	1 onwards.
	2 One made of Udum- 
bara wood is mentioned in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 The 
violation of the bed of a Guru, or teacher, is already mentioned 
in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	4 while the adjective talpya, ‘born 
in the nuptial couch,’ denotes ‘legitimate’ in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.
	5 1) Rv. vii. 55, 8; Av. v. 17, 12; 
xiv. 2, 31. 41. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 6, 4;

disches Leben, 154.

तलव
तलव
 in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or human 
sacrifice, in the Yajurveda,
	1 denotes a ‘musician’ of some kind. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1. Cf. 
Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 83, n. 15.

तष्टृ
तष्टृ
 is found in the Rigveda
	1 in the sense of ‘carpenter,’ 
like Takṣan, which is from the same root takṣ, ‘to fashion.’ 1) i. 61, 4; 105, 18; 130, 4; iii. 38, 1; vii. 32, 20; x. 93, 12; 119, 5. Cf. 
Nirukta, v. 21.

तसर
तसर
 denotes the weaver's ‘shuttle’ in the Rigveda
	1 and 
the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	2 1) x. 130, 2. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 83; Mai
trāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 9; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xxxviii. 3; Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa, ii. 6, 4, 2. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 254.

तस्कर
तस्कर
 occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and frequently later,
	2 denoting 
‘thief’ or ‘robber.’ It appears to be practically synonymous 
with Stena, in connexion with which it is often mentioned.
	3 
The Stena and the Taskara are contrasted in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā
	4 with the Malimlu, who is a burglar or house-breaker, 
while they are highwaymen, or, as the Rigveda
	5 puts it, ‘men 
who haunt the woods and risk their lives’ (tanū-tyajā vanar-gū). 
In another passage of the Rigveda,
	6 however, the dog is told to 
bark at the Taskara or the Stena, which clearly points to an 
attempt at house-breaking. The thief goes about at night,
	7 and 
knows the paths
	8 on which he attacks his victim. In one 
passage of the Rigveda
	9 the use of cords is mentioned, but 
whether to bind the thieves when captured, or to bind the 
victim, is not clear.
	10 The Atharvaveda
	11 refers to the Stena 
and the Taskara as cattle and horse thieves.
	12 1) i. 191, 5; vi. 27, 3; vii. 55, 3; 
viii. 29, 6. 2) Av. iv. 3, 2; xix. 47, 7; 50, 5; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 77-78; xii. 62; 
xvi. 21, etc; Nirukta, iii. 14. 3) Rv. vii. 55. 3; Av. xix. 47, 7; 
50, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 79; 
xvi. 21, etc. 4) xi. 79 (the Malimlu is janeṣu, ‘among 
men’; the others vane, ‘in the forest’). 
Cf. for the Malimlu, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
vi. 3, 2, 6; Atharvaveda, xix. 49, 10. 5) x. 4, 6. 6) vii. 55, 3. 7) Rv. i. 191, 5. 8) Rv. viii. 29, 6. 9) x. 4, 6. 10) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 178, n. 11) xix. 50, 5. Cf. Rv. x. 97, 10 (stena). 12) Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 984.

तायु
तायु
 was another name for thief, perhaps of a less 
distinguished and more domestic character than the highway
man, for though he is referred to as a cattle-thief,
	13 he is also 
alluded to as a stealer of clothes (vastra-mathi)
	14 and as a 
debtor.
	15 In one passage the Tāyus are said to disappear at 
the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called yāvayad-dveṣas, 
‘driving away hostile beings,’ and ṛta-pā, ‘guardian of order’), 
like the stars of heaven (nakṣatra).
	16 
In the Śatarudriya litany of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	17 Rudra 
is called lord of assailers (ā-vyādhin), thieves (stena), robbers 
(taskara), pickpockets (stāyu), stealers (muṣṇant), and cutters 
(vi-kṛnta); and designations of sharpers (gṛtsa) and bands 
(gaṇa, vrāta), apparently of robbers, are mentioned.
	18 It is 
therefore not surprising that the Rigveda
	19 should contain 
many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that 
the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night
	20 
chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and 
robbers. 
Pischel
	21 suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda
	22 
Vasiṣṭha is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since 
Vasiṣṭha was attacking the house of his father Varuṇa, he was 
only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own. 
But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain.
	23 
Sāyaṇa's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda,
	24 as 
referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the 
Panjab, seems quite probable.
	25 
The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been 
left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them 
in stocks
	26 seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate — 
and in all probability earlier also, as in other countries — a more 
severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the 
king.
	27 There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of 
conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda,
	28 
and the ordeal known to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	29 is not said 
to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property 
was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it. 
Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had 
passed from the actual thief into the possession of another 
person. 13) Rv. i. 65, 1; vii. 86, 5. 14) Rv. iv. 38, 5. 15) Rv. vi. 12, 5. No doubt this theft 
is the result of despair at being in debt, 
which might lead to loss of liberty (Ṛṇa). 16) Rv. i. 50, 2. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic 
Mythology, p. 47. 17) xvi. 20, 21. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

Av. vi. 63, 3 = 84, 4; 115, 2. 3; 121; 
xix. 47, 9; 50, 1, all of which passages 
are cited by Zimmer, 181, 182, to prove 
this practice. But it must be noted that 
Rv. vii. 86, 5, alone is not at all con
clusive evidence, though Av. xix. 47, 9; 
50, 1 (drupade āhan), probably mean the 
same thing. Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 976, 983, renders the 
passages as referring to casting a thief 
into a snare, and Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 1, 106, makes Rv. vii. 86, 5, 
refer to the cattle-thief (paśu-tṛp) taking 
away the rope from the calf he means 
to steal. For Rv. x. 4, 6, see above, 
n. 10. The German and Slavonic 
parallels cited by Zimmer, 182, n., 
support his view. See also for a similar 
punishment in case of debt, Ṛṇa. 27) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xii. 43

तस्तुव
तस्तुव,
 or Tasruva, as the Paippalāda recension has it, is 
the name of a remedy against snake poison, and is mentioned 
along with Tābuva in the Atharvaveda.

ताजद्भङ्ग
ताजद्-भङ्ग
 (‘easily broken’) is apparently the name of 
a tree or plant in the Atharvaveda.
	1 The Kauśika Sūtra
	2 
treats it as a compound word, and its commentator makes it 
out to be the castor-oil plant (eraṇḍa). Whitney,
	3 however, 
treats the expression as two separate words, and thinks that 
the passage means ‘may they be broken suddenly (tājat) like 
hemp (bhañga).’ 1) viii. 8, 3 (a battle hymn). 2) xvi 14. Cf. Bloomfield's edition,

ताण्ड
 seems to be the name of a sage to whose school 
belonged the Tāṇḍa Brāhmaṇa mentioned in the Lāṭyāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra.
	1 1) vii. 10, 17. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 49.

ताण्डविन्द
ताण्ड-विन्द,
 or Tāṇḍa-vindava, is the name of a teacher 
mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.
	1 1) viii. 10. The manuscripts differ as to the form of the name.

ताण्डि
ताण्डि
 occurs as the name of a pupil of Bādarāyaṇa in the

Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) See Konow's Translation, 80, n. 2.

ताण्ड्य

	3 of the 
Sāmaveda represents the school of the Tāṇḍins. 1) vi. 1, 2, 25. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine

तात
तात,
 apparently ‘dada's boy,’ an affectionate term of address 
by a father (cf. Tata) to a son, is found in the Brāhmaṇas,
	1 
occurring in the vocative only. But in the sense of ‘father,’ 
through confusion with Tata, it occurs also as early as the 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
	2 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 14, 4; 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 6; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 4, 2. 2) i. 3, 3, where Tata and Tāta are 
given as variant forms of the address 
of the child to the father. Little, 
Grammatical Index, 75, takes Tāta to 
mean ‘father’ primarily, but this seems 
unlikely. 
Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 449, 454.

तादुरी
तादुरी
 is mentioned in a verse of the Atharvaveda
	1 together 
with the female frog (Maṇḍūkī). Some similar animal must 
be meant,
	2 but Roth,
	3 with the commentator Durga on the 
Nirukta,
	4 regards the word as an adjective describing the frog. 1) iv. 15, 14. 2) Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 175. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 
where he suggests tāḍurī, from the 
root taḍ, ‘beat,’ with the sense of 
‘splashing.’ 4) ix. 7.

तान्व
1. Tānva in an obscure passage of the Rigveda
	1 seems to 
mean a ‘legitimate son,’ who is said not to leave the heritage 
(riktha) of his father to his sister (jāmi). The exact meaning 
is probably unascertainable,
	2 but the passage may convey a 
statement of what was no doubt the fact, that the daughter 
had no share in the paternal inheritance; her brother had to 
provide for her during her life if she remained unmarried, but 
she had no independent portion.

the modern law of the Panjab.

तान्व
2. Tānva appears to be a patronymic, ‘descendant of Tanva,’ 
in a verse of the Rigveda.
	1 Ludwig
	2 thinks that it is the 
patronymic of Duḥśīma, who is mentioned in the preceding 
verse, but this is uncertain. 1) x. 93, 15. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166.

तापस
1. Tāpasa, ‘ascetic,’ is not found in Vedic literature till the 
Upaniṣads.

तापस
2. Tāpasa is a name of Datta who was Hotṛ priest at the 
snake festival described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15).

ताबुव
ताबुव
 is the name in the Atharvaveda
	1 of a remedy against 
snake poison. The Paippalāda recension has Tāvuca instead. 
Weber
	2 thinks that the original form was Tāthuva, from the 
root sthā, ‘stand,’ and that it meant ‘stopping’; but this is 
hardly probable.

तायु
तायु,
 ‘thief,’ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda.

तारुक्ष्य
 is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya
	1 and 
Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas.
	2 In the former passage Tārkṣya is 
a variant reading, and in the latter Tārkṣya is read, but this 
is probably only due to confusion with Tārkṣya, the reputed

तार्क्ष्य
तार्क्ष्य
 is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as a divine steed, 
apparently the sun conceived as a horse.
	2 But Foy,
	3 judging 
by the name, apparently a patronymic of Tṛkṣi, who is known 
from the Rigveda
	4 onwards as a descendant of Trasadasyu, 
thinks that a real steed, the property of Tṛkṣi, is meant; but 
this is not very probable.

sented as a bird (vāyasa), also a symbol 
of the sun. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xv. 18, he is mentioned with Ariṣṭanemi, 
originally an epithet of his (Rv. i. 89, 6; 
x. 178, 1), as a person, and in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 13, he 
appears as Vaipaśyata (Vaipaścita in 
Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7), king 
of the birds (cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books 
of the East, 44, 369).

तार्प्य
तार्प्य
 denotes, in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later,
	2 a garment 
made of some material, the nature of which is uncertain. The 
commentators on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	3 suggest that a linen garment, or one thrice 
soaked in ghee, or one made of the tṛpā or of the triparṇa plant, 
is meant: it is doubtful whether the sense was known even to 
the author of the Brāhmaṇa himself. Goldstücker's
	4 rendering 
of the word is ‘silken garment,’ which Eggeling
	5 is inclined 
to accept.^6 1) xviii. 4, 31. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 11, 6;

तार्ष्टाघ
तार्ष्टाघ,
 a species of tree, is mentioned in the Kauśika 
Sūtra,
	1 while the adjective formed from it, tārṣṭāghī, ‘derived 
from the Tārṣṭāgha tree,’ is found in the Atharvaveda.

तितउ
तितü
 
	1 is found once in the Rigveda
	2 denoting a ‘sieve,’ or 
perhaps ‘winnowing fan,’ which was used for purifying corn 
(saktu). 1) On the peculiar form of this word,

तित्तिर
तित्तिर, तित्तिरि,
 is the name of the partridge in the later 
Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas,
	2 being presumably an onomato
poetic formation. The bird is described as having variegated 
plumage (bahu-rūpa). It is usually associated with the Kapiñ- 
jala and Kalaviṅka. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 2;

तिथि
तिथि,
 as the name of a lunar day, the thirtieth part of a lunar 
month of rather over twenty-seven days, is only found in the 
later Sūtras,
	1 being completely unknown to the Brāhmaṇas, in 
which the only day is the natural one.

तिमिर्घदौरेश्रुत
तिमिर्घ दौरे-श्रुत
 (‘descendant of Dūreśruta’) is men
tioned as Agnīdh (‘fire-kindling’) priest at the snake sacrifice 
described in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxv. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

तिरश्च
तिरश्च
 is read in some manuscripts of the Atharvaveda
	1 in 
the description of the Vrātya's throne (Āsandī), meaning ‘the 
cross-pieces.’ But the reading should be tiraścye, which is 
adjectival, and is used in the same sense. 1) xv. 3, 5. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 776; Keith, Śāṅkh- 
āyana Araṇyaka, 19, n. 3.

तिरश्ची
तिरश्ची
 is, according to the Anukramaṇī, the author of a 
Rigvedic hymn
	1 in which he appeals to Indra to hear his call. 
The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 adopts this view of the name, 
and mentions a Tiraścī Āṅgirasa. But Roth
	3 thinks that the 
word is not a proper name at all. 1) viii. 95, 4. 2) xii. 6, 12. 3) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen-

तिरश्चीनवंश
तिरश्चीन-वंश,
 ‘cross-beam,’ is used to denote a ‘bee
hive’ in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	1 See also Vaṃśa. 1) iii. 1, 1. Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 75.

तिरिन्दिर
तिरिन्दिर
 is mentioned in a Dānastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’ 
in the Rigveda
	1 as having, along with Parśu, bestowed gifts 
on the singer. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 this state
ment is represented by a tale that the Kaṇva Vatsa obtained 
a gift from Tirindira Pāraśavya, Tirindira and Parśu being 
in this version thus treated as one and the same man. 
Ludwig
	3 sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus 
had gained a victory over Tirindira, and gave a part of the 
booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the 
correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer
	4 shows to be 
most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by Tirindira and 
Parśu, though Weber
	5 thinks that the singers were Yadus, not 
the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian (cf. , and see Parśu), and he thinks that in this there is 
evidence of continual close relations between India and Iran. 
This is perfectly possible, but the evidence for it is rather 
slight. 
6 For the recent controversy as to 
Iranian names found at Boghaz-kiöi, 
cf. Jacobi, Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1909, 721 et seq.; Oldenberg, 
ibid., 1095-1100; Keith, ibid., 1100-1106; 
Sayce, ibid., 1106, 1107; Kennedy, 
ibid., 1107-1119. Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 1, 94 et seq., argues in favour 
of an early connexion of Iranians and 
Indians in Arachosia, where he places 
part of the action of the Rigveda. 
Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 17, 16, 277, holds that traces of 
Iranian connexion are signs of late 
date; Arnold, ibid., 18, 205 et seq., 
opposes this view. 1) viii. 6, 46-48. 2) xvi. 11. 20. 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160,

तिरीट
तिरीट
 
	1 is found in the Atharvaveda
	2 in the adjectival 
derivative tirīṭin used of a demon, and presumably meaning 
‘adorned with a tiara.’ 1) Meaning, according to later native 
lexicographers, ‘head-dress’ or ‘dia
dem.’ 2) viii. 6, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 265; Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 495.

तिर्य
तिर्य
 occurs in the Atharvaveda
	1 as an epithet of Karambha, 
‘gruel.’ It is probably equivalent to tilya, ‘made of sesamum,’ 
as rendered by Roth
	2 and Whitney,
	3 but tiriya is read by 
Roth
	4 in the Rāja-nighaṇṭu as a kind of rice. 1) iv. 7, 3. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
155. 4) See Whitney, loc. cit., with Lan
man's additional note. Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 377, construes 
the adjective with viṣam, and renders 
‘the poison which comes in a horizontal 
direction’ (cf. tiryañc). Grill, Hundert 
Lieder,^2 121, amends to atiriya, ‘over
flowing.’ 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 270; 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 
3, 201.

तिर्यञ्चाङ्गिरस
तिर्यञ्च् आङ्गिरस
 is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans, or 
Chants, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The name is doubtless 
feigned. 1) xii. 6, 12. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

तिल
तिल
 denotes in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 the sesamum 
plant, and particularly its grains, from which a rich oil (Taila) 
was extracted. It is often
	3 mentioned in connexion with Māṣa, 
‘kidney bean.’ The Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	4 attributes the bean 
and the sesamum to the winter (hemanta) and the cool (śiśira) 
seasons. The stalk of the sesamum plant (tila-piñjī,
	5 til-piñja
	6) 
was used for fuel, and the seed was boiled in the form of 
porridge (tilaudana
	7) for food. 1) ii. 8, 3; vi. 140, 2; xviii. 3, 69;

तिल्वक
तिल्वक
 is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a tree 
(Symplocos racemosa), near which it is inauspicious to construct 
a grave. The adjectival derivative tailvaka, ‘made of the wood 
of the Tilvaka,’ is found in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
	2 and is 
employed to describe the yūpa, or sacrificial post, in the 
Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

तिष्य
तिष्य
 occurs twice in the Rigveda,
	1 apparently as the name 
of a star,
	2 though Sāyaṇa takes it to mean the sun. It is 
doubtless identical with the Avestan Tistrya. Later it is the 
name of a lunar mansion: see Nakṣatra. 1) v. 54, 13; x. 64, 8 (with Kṛśānu as 
in archer). 2) Weber, Naxatra, 2, 290; Zimmer,

तुग्र
तुग्र
 appears in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of the father of 
Bhujyu, a protégé of the Aśvins, who is accordingly called 
Tugrya
	2 or Taugrya.
	3 A different Tugra seems to be referred 
to in other passages of the Rigveda
	4 as an enemy of Indra. 1) i. 116, 3; 117, 14; vi. 62, 6. 2) Rv. viii. 3, 23; 74, 14. 3) Rv. i. 117, 15; 118, 6; 182, 5. 6;

veda, 3, 157.

तुग्र्य
तुग्र्य
 occurs in the Rigveda as a patronymic of Bhujyu,
	1 
but also in a passage
	2 in which no reference to Bhujyu appears 
to be meant, and in which it may mean ‘a man of the house 
of Tugra.’ A similar sense seems to occur in the locative 
plural feminine in the Rigveda,
	3 where (supplying vikṣu) the 
meaning must be ‘among the Tugrians.’ This explanation 
may also apply to the epithet of Indra
	4 or Soma,
	5 tugryā-vṛdh, 
‘rejoicing among the Tugrians.’ 1) Who is also called Tugrasya sūnu, 
Rv. vi. 62, 6. Cf. the use of Pajriya 
and perhaps Kṛṣṇiya in the patronymic 
sense without Vṛddhi. 2) viii. 32, 20. 3) i. 33, 15. Cf. Griffith, Hymns of

gests an alteration to make it refer to 
Indra.

 is the name in the Rigveda

in another hymn
	2 appears to be called Tūtuji. 1) vi. 26, 4; x. 49, 4. 2) vi. 20, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Oldenberg,

तुमिञ्जऔपोदिति
तुमिञ्ज औपोदिति
 is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 
(i. 7, 2, 1) as a Hotṛ priest at a Sattra, or ‘sacrificial session,’ 
and as having been engaged in a discussion with Suśravas.

तुरकावषेय
तुर कावषेय
 is mentioned in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) 
at the end of the tenth book of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as 
the source of the doctrine set forth in that book, and as 
separated, in the succession of teachers, from Śāṇḍilya by 
Yajñavacas and Kuśri. In the same Brāhmaṇa
	2 he is quoted 
by Śāṇḍilya as having erected a fire-altar on the Kārotī. In 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 he appears as a Purohita, or ‘domestic 
priest,’ of Janamejaya Pārikṣita, whom he consecrated king. 
In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	4 and a Khila
	5 he appears as 
an ancient sage. Oldenberg,
	6 no doubt rightly, assigns him 
to the end of the Vedic period. He is probably
	7 identical with 
Tura, the deva-muni, ‘saint of the gods,’ who is mentioned in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

तुरश्रवस्
तुर-श्रवस्
 is the name of a seer mentioned in the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having pleased Indra by two Sāmans 
(Chants) of his composition. Indra in return appears to have 
given him the oblation of the Pārāvatas on the Yamunā. 1) ix. 4, 10. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions

तुर्यवाह्
तुर्य-वाह्,
 masc.; Turyauhī, fem., ‘a four-year-old ox or 
cow,’ is mentioned in the later Saṃhitās.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 3, 2;

तुर्व
तुर्व
 occurs only once in the Rigveda (x. 62, 10), doubtless 
as a name of the Turvaśa people or king.

तुर्वश
तुर्वश
 occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of 
a man or of a people, usually in connexion with Yadu. The 
two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting 
particle, Turvaśa Yadu or Yadu Turvaśa.
	2 In a plural form 
the name Turvaśa occurs once with the Yadus,
	3 and once 
alone
	4 in a hymn in which the singular has already been used. 
In one passage
	5 the dual Turvaśā-Yadū actually occurs, and 
in another
	6 Yadus Turvaś ca, ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other 
passages
	7 Turvaśa appears alone, while in one
	8 Turvaśa and 
Yādva occur. 
From these facts Hopkins
	9 deduces the erroneousness of the 
ordinary view,
	10 according to which Turvaśa is the name of 
a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvaśa 
as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is 
not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument 
based on the theory
	11 that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda 
are the Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas, Yadus, and Pūrus, it is 
perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were 
two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently 
were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the 
Turvaśā-Yadū and speak of Yadus Turvaś ca. This explanation 
also suits best the use of the plural of Turvaśa in two Rigvedic 
hymns. 
In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvaśa was his partici
pation in the war against Sudās, by whom he was defeated.
	12 
Hopkins
	13 suggests that he may have been named Turvaśa 
because of his fleet (tura) escape from the battle. His escape 
1 i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; vi. 20, 
12; 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14; 
45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvaśa 
is joined with Yakṣu, apparently a con
temptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
15, 261). Cf. Tṛtsu. 
may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages
	14 Indra's 
aid to Turvaśa (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant 
that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned 
as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvaśa 
and Yadu kings, and that Turvaśa appears in the eighth book 
of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince, 
the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned.
	15 
Griffith,
	16 however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat 
by Turvaśa and Yadu of Arṇa and Citraratha on the Sarayu;
	17 
but the evidence for this is quite inadequate. 
Two passages of the Rigveda
	18 seem to refer to an attack by 
Turvaśa and Yadu on Divodāsa, the father of Sudās. It is 
reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two 
peoples on Divodāsa, for there is some improbability of the 
references being to the Turvaśa, who was concerned in the 
attack on Sudās, the son. 
Zimmer
	19 considers that the Turvaśas were also called Vṛcī- 
vants. This view is based on a hymn
	20 in which reference 
is made to the defeat of the Vṛcīvants on the Yavyāvatī and 
Hariyūpīyā in aid of Daivarāta, and of Turvaśa in aid of 
Sṛñjaya, the latter being elsewhere
	21 clearly the son of Deva
rāta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas 
with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient
	22 to assume 
that they were allies. 
Later, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	23 the Turvaśas appear 
as allies of the Pañcālas, Taurvaśa horses, thirty-three in 
number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being 
mentioned.
	24 But otherwise the name disappears: this lends 
probability to Oldenberge's conjecture
	25 that the Turvaśas 
became merged in the Pañcāla people. Hopkins
	26 considers 
that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named 
from the family of Turvaśa; but this view is less likely, since 
it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men. 
It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the 
Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with Sudās. They 
apparently crossed the Paruṣṇī,
	27 but from which side is dis
puted. The view of Pischel
	28 and Geldner,
	29 that they advanced 
from the west towards the east, where the Bharatas were (see 
Kuru), is the more probable. 2) v. 31, 8. 3) i. 108, 8. 4) viii. 4, 18; singular with Ānava in

तुर्वीति
तुर्वीति
 is mentioned several times in the Rigveda, both in 
association with Vayya
	1 and alone.
	2 In three passages
	3 
reference is made to Indra aiding him over a flood. Ludwig
	4 
has conjectured that he was king of the Turvaśas and Yadus. 
But there is no sufficient evidence for this view, though 
presumably he was of the Turvaśa tribe. 1) i. 54, 6; ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. 2) Rv. i. 36, 18; 61, 11; 112, 23. 3) i. 61, 11; ii. 13, 12; iv. 19, 6. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147;

तुला
तुला,
 ‘scales,’ is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	1 
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 also speaks of the balance in con
nexion with the weighing of a man's good and evil deeds in 
the next and in this world. This differs very considerably 
from the later balance
	3 ordeal, in which a man was weighed 
twice, and was pronounced guilty or innocent according as, on 
the second occasion, he was more or less heavy than on the 
first. It is not possible to read the later practice into the 
earlier.

 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later,
	2 regularly denotes the

तूणव
 denotes in the later Saṃhitās

तूर्घ्न
तूर्घ्न
 is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyak (v. 1) as 
the northern part of Kurukṣetra.
	1 Its exact position, however, 
cannot be ascertained. 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78.

तूर्णाश
तूर्णाश,
 in the Rigveda,
	1 seems to denote a ‘mountain 
torrent.’ 1) viii. 32, 4. Cf. Nirukta, v. 16.

तूर्वयाण
तूर्वयाण
 is the name of a prince mentioned in the Rigveda. 
He appears by name in two passages,
	1 and is clearly alluded 
to in a third,
	2 as an enemy of Atithigva, Āyu, and Kutsa. 
With this accords the fact that the Pakthas were opposed in 
the battle of the ten kings to the Tṛtsus,
	3 and that Tūrvayāṇa 
 is shown by another passage of the Rigveda
	4 to have been 
a prince of the Pakthas. He is there represented as having 
been a protégé of Indra, who aided him against Cyavāna and 
his guardians, the Maruts. It is not probable that he is 
identical with Suśravas.

two preceding passages shows); per
haps also viii. 53, 2. In i. 174, 3, 
Tūrvayāṇa seems also to be a proper 
name, though Roth, St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v., here regards the word 
as an adjective. 3) vii. 18. 4) x. 61, 1 et seq.; Pischel, Vedische

तृक्षि
तृक्षि
 is, in the Rigveda,
	1 the name of a prince who was 
a Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu.’ He also appears 
with the Druhyu and the Pūru peoples in another hymn.
	2 It 
has been conjectured, but it is not probable, that the steed 
Tārkṣya (as ‘belonging to Tṛkṣi’) was his.

two persons are identical (cf. Hille

तृण
तृण,
 ‘grass,’ is often mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
It was used as straw to roof in a house or hut.

तृणजलायुक
तृण-जलायुक,
 ‘caterpillar,’ is mentioned in the Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iv. 2, 4).

तृणस्कन्द
तृण-स्कन्द
 occurs once in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of 
a prince, his subjects (viśaḥ) being referred to.
	2 The word 
may originally have meant ‘grasshopper.’
	3 1) i. 172, 3. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, takes viśaḥ as ‘cantons,’ but see Viś. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

तृतीयक
तृतीयक,
 ‘the tertian (fever),’ is mentioned in the Athar
vaveda (i. 25, 4; v. 22, 13; xix. 39, 10). See Takman.

तृत्सु
तृत्सु
 occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular
	1 and several 
times in the plural,
	2 as a proper name. The Tṛtsus were 
clearly helpers of Sudās in the great battle against the ten 
kings, Śimyu, the Turvaśa, the Druhyu, Kavaṣa, the Pūru, 
the Anu, Bheda, Śambara, the two Vaikarṇas, and perhaps 
the Yadu, who led with them as allies
	3 the Matsyas, Pakthas, 
Bhalānas, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus, and perhaps 
Yakṣus.
	4 The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one 
hymn of the Rigveda,
	5 and is evidently alluded to in two 
others.
	6 The great battle took place on the Paruṣṇī, but there 
was also a fight on the Yamunā with Bheda, the Ajas, Śigrus, 
and Yakṣus. As the Yamunā and the Parusṇī represent 
opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot 
with Hopkins
	7 safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see 
exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should 
be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two 
later hymns,
	6 and not in the hymn
	5 describing the battle itself; 
besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon. 
It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the 
Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under 
Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as 
advancing to the Vipāś and Śutudrī.
	8 Roth ingeniously 
brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies 
by Sudās, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the 
Rigveda — a book attributed to the Vasiṣṭha family — and thought 
that there was a reference in one verse
	9 to the defeat of the 
Bharatas by Sudās. But it seems certain that the verse is 
mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as 
victors with Sudās.
	10 Ludwig
	11 accordingly identifies the 
Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg,
	12 after accepting this 
view at first,
	13 later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were 
the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with 
the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one 
passage
	14 the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their 
hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas,
	15 and 
would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas. 
But Geldner
	16 has suggested with great probability that Tṛtsu, 
who is once mentioned in the singular,
	17 means the Tṛtsu 
king — that is, Sudās.
	18 This explanation alone justifies the 
description
	19 of the Bharatas as Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ,
	20 ‘subjects of 
the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the Tṛtsu Gotra or family, for the people 
could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The 
Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close con
nexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse 
process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by 
the fact that the Pratṛdaḥ are referred to as receiving Vasiṣṭha.
	21 
This name of the Tṛtsu dynasty is probably older than its 
connexion with Vasiṣṭha in the time of Sudās, a conclusion 
supported by the name of Pratardana, who is mentioned later 
as a descendant of Divodāsa,
	22 an ancestor of Sudās. The 
Tṛtsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as 
Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its 
relation with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, see Sudās. 
If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the 
Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the 
territory between the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā, it is clear
	23 
that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably 
others of those tribes to form the Kuru people. Already in 
the Rigveda
	24 the Tṛtsus are allied with the Sṛñjayas, and in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	25 one Purohita serves both Kurus 
and Sṛñjayas. 
Hillebrandt
	26 considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified 
with the Bharatas, but that Sudās and the Bharatas represent 
an invading body, which, however, became allied with the 
Tṛtsus and the Vasiṣṭha priests. He also thinks that the 
Rigveda reveals a time when Divodāsa, the grandfather or 
ancestor of Sudās, was living in Arachosia, on the Sarasvatī, 
and warring against the Paṇis, whom he identifies with the 
Parnians. But this conjecture
	27 cannot be regarded as 
probable. In the Sarasvatī
	28 it is not necessary to see any 
other river than the later Sarasvatī, in the middle country, 
which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also 
significant that there are references
	29 to contests between 
Turvaśa Yadu and Atithigva or Divodāsa. Thus there is no 
reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the 
middle country, and not in Iran. 1) vii. 18, 13. 2) vii. 18, 7. 15. 19; 33, 5. 6; 83, 4. 6. 8. 3) They were regarded as enemies of 
the kings by Roth, Zur Litteratur und 
Geschichte des Weda, 95, and by Zimmer, 
op. cit., 126, The latter, however, 
altered his view (see pp. 430, 431, 
which Hopkins, op. cit., 260, has over
looked), and there is no doubt that 
the later opinion is correct. Cf. also 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 
3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these 
tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhalānas, 
Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, were probably 
settled in the north-west, to the west 
of the Indus, and around the Kabul 
River. The Anus, Pūrus, Turvaśas, 
Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably 
tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, Śigrus, 
and Yakṣus, tribes of the east, under 
Bheda; Śambara may also have been 
a native of the east; Śimyu and Kavaṣa 
are doubtful; and the Vaikarṇau prob
ably belonged to the north-west. 4) This is uncertain; the text of the 
Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yakṣu, and 
the same word recurs in verse 19. On 
the other hand, the word Yadu would 
naturally be expected in verse 6, as Tur
vaśa is mentioned. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 122, says that Yadu occurs in 
vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yakṣu 
in both places, evidently by oversight. 
Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 261, n., considers that Tur
vaśa, the Yakṣu, is a sarcastic expres
sion, instead of Turvaśa, the Yadu, 
making Turvaśa, whom he regards as 
king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a 
member of an insignificant people, and 
alluding to him also as a sacrificial 
victim (as it were, yaṣṭavya, ‘to be 
offered’; of puroḍāś, ‘cake of sacrifice,’ 
in verse 6, as a pun on purogās, ‘leader’). 
Whether Yakṣu is used contemptuously 
for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to 
believe that the Yadus are referred 
to. 5) vii. 18. 6) vii. 33 and 83. 7) India, Old and New, 52. No such

Sudās and of the Bharatas is found 
coupled in Rv. iii. 53, 9. 12. 24, and in 
Rv. vi. 16, 4, 5, Divodāsa is coupled 
with the Bharatas in such a way as to 
suggest irresistibly that Divodāsa was 
a Bharata. 19) Rv. vii. 33, 6. 20) That this is the sense of viśaḥ is 
almost certain. See Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, loc. cit. Zimmer, Altindisches

but see Vīś. 21) Rv. vii. 33, 14. Geldner (op. cit., 
138, 139) ingeniously suggests that 
Vasiṣṭha, being miraculously born, 
needed a Gotra, and so became a Tṛtsu. 22) Pratardana is mentioned in the

तृष्ट
तृष्ट

tain; it may be Tṛṣṭhā-varutrī. See 
von Schroeder's edition, p. 106, n. 2) xxx. 1, where again the reading is 
uncertain. The Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā,

‘praise of rivers,’ in the Rigveda.
	1 There seems to be no 
means of identifying it. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14.

तेजन
तेजन
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 a rod or staff of reed used 
for measuring a field. In the Atharvaveda the sense of 
‘bamboo’ is found twice,
	2 the bamboo being specified in the 
second passage as ‘of the spring’ (vāsantika); more particularly 
it denotes the shaft of an arrow,

तेजनी
तेजनी
 denotes in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas a bundle 
of reeds,
	1 and in some cases such a bundle twisted into a rope,
	2 
for the two ends of the Tejanī are mentioned. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 8, 3, 12;

तेजस्
तेजस्
 is regarded by Schrader
	1 as having in the Rigveda
	2 
the specific sense of ‘axe.’ But in all the passages the sense 
of the ‘bolt’ of the god is adequate. 1) Prehistoric Antiquities, 221. 2) Cf. vi. 3, 5; 8, 5; 15, 19.

तैत्तिरीय
 is the name of one of the divisions of the Black 
Yajurveda, which is, however, not found thus described until

तैमात
तैमात
 is twice mentioned as a species of snake in the 
Atharvaveda.
	1 1) v. 13, 6; 18, 4. Cf. Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 243; 
Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
425; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95.

तैल
तैल,
 ‘sesamum oil,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	1 
where
	2 reference is made to keeping such oil in jars. In the 
Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	3 reference is made to anointing with 
sesamum oil. 1) i. 7, 2 (all the manuscripts have 
taula, which must be wrong; the Paip
palāda MS has tūla: see Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 7). 2) xx. 136, 16. 3) xi. 4. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben. 240, 
241.

तोक
तोक
 denotes ‘children’ or ‘descendants’ generally in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 The word is often joined with Tanaya.
	3 1) i. 43, 2; ii. 2, 11; 9, 2; vii. 62, 6; 
viii. 5, 20; 67, 11, etc. 2) Av. i. 13, 2; 28, 3; v. 19, 2;

etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7.

तोक्मन्
तोक्मन्,
 neut., denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 the green 
shoots of any kind of grain. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 
reference is made to the shoots of rice (vrīhi), large rice (mahā- 
vrīhi), panic seed (priyaṅgu), and barley (yava). 1) x. 62, 8. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 13, 81;

Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, etc. 3) viii. 16. Cf. for its use at the 
Sautrāmaṇī, Hillebrandt, Rituallitte- 
ratur, 160.

तोत्त्र
तोत्त्र,
 a ‘goad’ for driving cattle, is mentioned in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 4, 1, 10).

तोद
तोद
 appears once to denote a ‘goad’ in the Rigveda,
	1 but 
more often
	2 it is an agent noun meaning ‘impeller.’ Geldner
	3 
considers that in one passage
	4 the sense is ‘wielder of the rod 
of punishment’ (later daṇḍa-dhara) — that is, ‘prince.’ 1) iv. 16, 11; Mantra in Kauśika 
Sūtra, 107. 2) Rv. vi. 6, 6; 12, 1, 3, are probably 
so to be understood. 3) Vedische Studien, 3, 74. 4) Rv. i. 150, 1.

तौग्र्य
तौग्र्य,
 ‘descendant of Tugra,’ is the patronymic of 
Bhujyu in the Rigveda.
	1 1) i. 117, 16; 118, 6; 182, 5. 6; viii. 5, 22; x. 39, 4.

तौदी
तौदी
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 appears to denote 
a plant. 1) x. 4, 24. Cf. St. Petersburg Dic
tionary, s.v. Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 578, leaves the word 
untranslated. Bloomfield, Hymns of 
the Atharvaveda, 608, suggests that it is 
a fanciful name, ‘the piercer,’ since it 
is associated with ghṛtācī, ‘dripping 
with ghee,’ which is clearly such a 
word.

तौर्वश
तौर्वश
 See Turvaśa.

तौल
तौल,
 the reading of the text of the Atharvaveda (i. 7, 2), 
and a form which is otherwise unknown and cannot be satis
factorily explained, must doubtless be meant for Taila.

तौविलिका
तौविलिका,
 occurring once in a hymn of the Atharvaveda,
	1 
is a word of quite uncertain sense. Roth
	2 thinks it means 
some kind of beast; Zimmer
	3 and Whitney
	4 regard it as a 
sort of plant; Sāyaṇa explains it as a disease-causing demon, 
while Bloomfield
	5 leaves the sense doubtful. 1) vi. 16, 3. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 72. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
292. 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 30, 466.

त्रपु
त्रपु
 denotes ‘tin’ in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 Its 
quality of being easily smelted, which Roth
	3 thinks is indicated 
by the name (as derived from the root trap, ‘be ashamed’), is 
clearly alluded to in the Atharvaveda passage. 1) xi. 3, 8. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xviii. 10; Maitrā

6, 5; Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 17, 3; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 
iv. 17, 7. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 
7, 5, 1, the form is trapus. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 53.

त्रसदस्यु
त्रस-दस्यु,
 son of Purukutsa,
	1 is mentioned in the Rigveda 
as king of the Pūrus.
	2 He was born to Purukutsa by his wife, 
Purukutsānī, at a time of great distress;
	3 this, according to 
Sāyaṇa, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is 
really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Girikṣit,
	4 
and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy, 
therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Girikṣit, Purukutsa, Trasa
dasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of Tṛkṣi,
	5 and, according 
to Ludwig,
	6 had a son Hiraṇin. Trasadasyu's chronological 
position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa, 
was a contemporary of Sudās, either as an opponent
	7 or as 
a friend.
	8 That Purukutsa was an enemy of Sudās is more 
probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was 
apparently
	9 at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the 
ten kings Pūrus were ranged against Sudās and the Tṛtsus. 
Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king. 
His people, the Pūrus, were settled on the Sarasvatī,
	10 which 
was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality 
according well with the later union of the Pūrus with the 
Kuru people, who inhabited that country. This union is 
exemplified in the person of Kuruśravaṇa, who is called 
Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda,
	11 
whose father was Mitrātithi, and whose son was Upamaśravas. 
The relation of Mitrātithi to Tṛkṣi does not appear. 
Another descendant of Trasadasyu was Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa, 
who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda.
	12 
He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ but, according 
to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	13 he was also Traidhātva, 
‘descendant of Tridhātu.’ The order of these two predecessors 
of Tryaruṇa cannot be determined in any way from Vedic 
literature. According to the later tradition,
	14 a prince named 
Tridhanvan preceded Tryaruṇa in the succession. Vedic tradi
tion further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu 
stood to Trivṛṣan or Tryaruṇa. 
Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Brāhmaṇas
	15 as a 
famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with Para Āṭṇāra, 
Vītahavya Śrāyasa, and Kakṣīvant Auśija, who in the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	16 are called ‘ancient great 
kings’ (pūrve mahārājāḥ). 1) Rv. v. 33, 8; vii. 19, 3; viii. 19, 
36; iv. 42, 8 et seq. 2) Rv. iv. 38, 1 et seq.; vii. 19, 3. 
He is merely alluded to in i. 63, 7; 
112, 4; viii. 8, 21; 36, 7; 37, 7; 49, 10. 3) Rv. iv. 42, 8 et seq. 4) Rv. v. 33, 8. 5) Rv. viii. 22, 7. He was a Pūru 
king. See vi. 46, 8. 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155, 
with reference to Rv. v. 33, 7 et seq. 7) So Ludwig, 3, 174, who alters 
Sudāsam to Sudāse, in support of this 
view, in Rv. i. 63, 7. Cf. Oldenberg, 
Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen 
Gesellschaft, 42, 204, 205, 219, Ṛgveda-

1, 153; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 
1, 112, n. 1. Foy, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 
34, 242, denies that the word in this 
passage is a proper name at all. 8) Cf. Hillebrandt, loc. cit. 9) Rv. i. 130, 7; Ludwig, 3, 114; but 
see Hillebrandt, 1, 113, 114. 10) Rv. vii. 95, 96; Ludwig, 3, 175;

Reader, 386 et seq.; Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 150, 184. 12) v. 27. 13) xiii. 3, 12. The Tāṇḍaka, cited 
by Sāyaṇa (Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des 
Ṛgveda, 67), has Trasadasyu, like the Rv. 14) Harivaṃśa, 714 et seq., where the 
name (716) is also misread as Tridhar
man. Traidhātva cannot reasonably 
be taken as representing a patronymic 
from Tridhanvan, as Sieg, op. cit., 74
76, seems to do. Trivṛṣan has entirely 
disappeared from the Epic tradition; 
there is thus no way of assigning a 
relative priority to either Trivṛṣan or 
Tridhanvan. 15) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16;

	1 as a pupil of Nigaḍa Pārṇavalki. 1) i. 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 372.

त्रायमाणा
त्रायमाणा
 denotes in the Atharvaveda

retaining its participial sense of ‘preserving,’ though this 
interpretation is not favoured by the accent.

त्रि-ककुद्
 
	1 or Tri-kakubh,
	2 ‘having three peaks,’ occurs in 
the Atharvaveda and later as the name of a mountain in the 
Himālaya, the modern Trikota. From it came the salve 
(Āñjana),

त्रिखर्व
त्रि-खर्व
 is the name of a school of priests mentioned in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (ii. 8, 3) as practising a special rite 
with success.

त्रित
त्रित
 is clearly a god
	1 in Vedic literature, but Yāska in one 
passage of the Nirukta
	2 already explains the name as that of 
a Ṛṣi or seer. 1) Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 67-69. 2) iv. 6.

त्रिपुर
त्रि-पुर,
 ‘a threefold stronghold,’ is alluded to in the 
Brāhmaṇas
	1 as a secure protection. But as the passages are 
mythical no stress can be laid on them as evidence for the 
existence of forts with three concentric walls. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 3, 25;

त्रियवि
त्रिय्-अवि
 See Tryavi.

त्रियुग
त्रि-युग,
 neut., is an expression occurring in the Rigveda
	1 
where it is said that the plants (oṣadhi) were born ‘three ages’ 
before the gods (devebhyas triyugaṃ purā). The commentator 
on the Nirukta
	2 thinks that the ages here meant are the Yugas 
of the later Indian chronology, the sense of the passage being 
that the plants were born in the first Yuga. The author of 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 understands three seasons — spring, 
the rains, and autumn — to be meant in the verse, taking the 
two words triyugaṃ purā separately as ‘formerly, in the three 
seasons.’ The vague sense ‘three ages’ is quite adequate: 
the use of ‘three’ in such cases is a favourite feature in 
folklore. Cf. Yuga. 1) x. 97, 1 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 
2, 6, 1, and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā; xii. 75. 2) ix. 28. 3) vii. 2, 4, 26.

त्रिवत्स
त्रि-वत्स,
 ‘three years old,’
	1 is an expression applied to 
cattle in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.

of this compound, cf. Tryavi. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 10;

Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 
9 et seq., where one explanation of the 
word is tri-varṣa.

त्रिवृत्
त्रि-वृत्,
 ‘threefold,’ is the designation of an amulet in the 
Atharvaveda (v. 28, 2. 4).

त्रिवेदकृष्णरातलौहित्य
त्रि-वेद कृष्ण-रात लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is 
the name of a teacher, a pupil of Śyāmajayanta Lauhitya, 
according to a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1).

त्रिशङ्कु
त्रि-शङ्कु
 is in Vedic literature the name of a sage men
tioned as a teacher in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad.
	1 There is no 
trace of the later legend by which he becomes the victim of 
Vasiṣṭha's curse and the object of Viśvāmitra's solicitude, 
being eventually fixed in the sky as a constellation.
	2 The 
confusion of the chronology in the tales of Triśaṅku is a good 
example of the worthlessness of the supposed epic tradition. 1) i. 10, 1. 2) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 362, 375 et seq.

त्रिशोक
त्रि-शोक
 is the name of an ancient mythical seer who is 
mentioned both in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda.
	2 A 
Sāman, or chant, named after him is referred to in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	3 1) i. 112, 13; viii. 45, 30. In x. 29, 2, 
the word seems merely to be an adjec
tive, meaning ‘with triple splendour.’ 2) iv. 29, 6. 3) viii. 1.

त्रैतन
त्रैतन
 appears in the Rigveda
	1 as a Dāsa, an enemy of 
Dīrghatamas, who seems to have engaged him in single 
combat and defeated him. The St. Petersburg Dictionary 
suggests that he is rather a supernatural being allied to Trita 
(cf. the Avestan Thrita and Thraetaona).

of Tryaruṇa in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 3, 12).

त्रैपद
त्रै-पद,
 neut., occurs as a measure of distance, ‘three
quarters’ of a Yojana, in the Pañcāviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, where

 is mentioned as a pupil of Aupacandhani or Aupa- 
jandhani in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 In the Mādhyaṃdina recension
	2 
his name occurs twice in the second Vaṃśa, in both cases as 
a pupil of Aupajandhani. 1) ii. 6, 3 (Kāṇva = ii. 5, 21 Mādhyaṃ
dina); iv. 6, 3 (= iv. 5, 27). 2) iv. 5, 27.

त्रैवृष्ण
त्रै-वृष्ण,
 ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ is the patronymic of 
Trayaruṇa in the Rigveda (v. 27, 1).

त्र्यरुणत्रैवृष्णत्रसदस्यु
त्र्य्-अरुण त्रै-वृष्ण त्रसदस्यु
 is the name of a prince 
whose generosity to a singer is celebrated in a hymn of the 
Rigveda.
	1 In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 he appears as 
Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka, and is the hero of the 
following story. He was out in his chariot with his Purohita, 
or domestic priest, Vṛśa Jāna, and by excessive speed in driving 
killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Puro
hita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The Śāṭyāyana Brāh
maṇa, cited by Sāyaṇa,
	3 elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had 
held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder. 
The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the 
crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa 
Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs — being 
Kṣatriyas they were partial to a Kṣatriya — Agni's glow ceased 
to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore 
it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the 
form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded 
in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations 
occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā,
	4 which connects the story with 
a hymn of the Rigveda.
	5 Sieg's attempt
	6 to show that the 
hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful.
	7 
It is clear that Trasadasyu must here mean ‘descendant of 
Trasadasyu,’ and not King Trasadasyu himself. The difference 
of the patronymics, Traivṛṣṇa and Traidhātva, by which he is 
referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were 
two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan), 
from whom Tryaruṇa was descended.
	8 The connexion with the 
Ikṣvākus is important (see Ikṣvāku). 1) v. 27, 1-3. 2) xiii. 3, 12. Cf. the Tāṇḍaka recen
sion, cited in Sāyaṇa, on Rv. v. 2, 
where Trasadasyu is given as the king's 
name. 3) On Rv., loc. cit. See also the 
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa version in Oertel,

त्र्यवि
त्र्य्-अवि
 designates a calf eighteen months old
	1 in the 
Rigveda
	2 and later Saṃhitās.
	3 1) The etymological meaning is ap
parently ‘having three sheep (periods)’ 
-that is, ‘having periods of thrice six 
months,’ just as the adjective pañcāvi 
means ‘having five periods of six 
months,’ or ‘thirty months old.’ 2) iii. 55, 14. 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; xviii. 12,

त्र्याशिर्
त्र्य्-आशिर्,
 ‘with three admixtures,’ is an epithet of Soma in 
the Rigveda.
	1 According to Sāyaṇa this means mixed with 
curds (Dadhi), meal (Saktu), and milk (Payas). More accurately 
it would seem
	2 to denote the milk (gavāśir), the barley (yavāśir), 
and the curds (dadhyāśir), which were used to mix with the 
Soma. 1) v. 27, 5. Cf. perhaps viii. 2, 7 
(traya Indrasya somāḥ sutāsaḥ, ‘three 
kinds of Soma pressed for Indra’). 2) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologic, 1, 
209; Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the 
East, 46, 422.

त्वच्
त्वच्,
 ‘skin,’ ‘hide,’ (a) denotes specially in the Rigveda
	1 
the hide used in the process of extracting the Soma juice from 
the plant. The Soma was pounded with stones (adri) upon the 
skin laid on the pressing boards (adhiṣavaṇe phalake),
	2 which, 
however, are not mentioned in the Rigveda. Or if a pestle and 
mortar were used, the skin was still placed underneath them 
to catch the drops of juice, not above, as Pischel
	3 thought. 
(b) Tvac also denotes the rind of the Soma plant that 
remains after the juice has been extracted.
	4 
(c) Metaphorically the term kṛṣṇā tvac, ‘the black skins,’ is 
applied to the aboriginal enemies of the invading Āryans.

for which, however, cf. Hillebrandt, 
op. cit., 51, n. 2, and see Dāsa.

त्वष्टृ
त्वष्टृ
 is employed once in the Atharvaveda
	1 to denote a 
‘carpenter,’ with a deliberate play on the name of the god 
Tvaṣṭṛ. He is there mentioned as using an axe (svadhiti) to 
fashion (from wood) ‘a well-made form’ (rūpaṃ sukṛtam). See 
Taṣṭṛ. 1) xii. 3, 33. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 688; Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 651.

त्वाष्ट्र
त्वाष्ट्र,
 ‘descendant of Tvaṣṭṛ,’ is the patronymic, in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	1 of the mythical teacher Ābhūti. 1) ii. 6, 3 (Kāṇva = ii. 5, 22 Mādhyaṃdina); iv. 6, 3 (= iv. 5, 28).

त्सरु
त्सरु,
 — (a) This word seems to denote some sort of crawling 
animal in one passage of the Rigveda.
	1 
(b) In the later literature the word means a ‘handle,’ as of 
a beaker (Camasa).
	1 In this sense also it seems to occur in the 
description of the plough (Lāṅgala) in the Atharvaveda
	2 and 
the later Saṃhitās.
	3 1) vii. 50, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 99. 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 4. 
Cf. Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 12, 12, 
etc. 2) iii. 17, 3, where the ordinary text 
has soma-satsaru (so the Pada text), and 
the Paippalāda recension has soma- 
pitsalam. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 5, 6, has 
sumati-tsaru; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 
12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 12; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xii. 71; Vasiṣṭha 
Dharma Sūtra, ii. 34, have somapitsaru, 
which Vasiṣṭha renders as ‘provided 
with a handle for the drinker of Soma’ 
(i.e., somapi-tsaru). Weber, Indische 
Studien, 17, 255, suggests soma-sa-tsaru, 
‘with (sa-) strap (uman, a conjectural 
word) and handle’ (tsaru). Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 116, 
prefers to read throughout sumati-tsaru, 
‘with well-smoothed handle,’ from the 
root seen in matī-kṛ, etc. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 236; Bühler, Sacred 
Books of the East, 14, 13.

त्सारिन्
त्सारिन्
 denotes, in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 a ‘hunter’ 
engaged in the chase of the takva (an unknown beast), according 
to Ludwig and Max Müller.
	2 But this explanation is quite 
conjectural. 1) i. 134, 5. 2) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 448.

दंश
दंश
 (lit., ‘biter’), ‘gad-fly,’ is mentioned in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad (vi. 9, 3; 10, 2).

दंष्ट्र
दंष्ट्र,
 denoting a prominent tooth, ‘tusk,’ or ‘fang’ of 
an animal, occurs often from the Rigveda onwards.
	1 1) Rv. ii. 13, 4; x. 87, 3; Av. iv. 36, 2; x. 5, 43; xvi. 7, 3, etc.

दक्षकात्यायनिआत्रेय
दक्ष कात्यायनि आत्रेय
 (‘descendant of Atri’) is mentioned 
in the Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 41, 1; iv. 17, 1) as a pupil of Śaṅkha Bābhravya.

दक्षजयन्तलौहित्य
दक्ष जयन्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is men
tioned in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Kṛṣṇarāta Lauhitya.

दक्षपार्वति
दक्ष पार्वति
 (‘descendant of Parvata’) is mentioned in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having performed a certain rite 
which his descendants, the Dākṣāyaṇas, still maintained, thus 
enjoying royal dignity down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa itself. 
He appears in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	2 also. 1) ii. 4, 4, 6. 2) iv. 4. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 223; 
4, 358; Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 12, 374 et seq.; Lévi, La Doctrine 
du Sacrifice, 138.

दक्षिणतस्कपर्द
दक्षिणतस्-कपर्द
 is an epithet of the Vasiṣṭhas in the 
Rigveda (vii. 33, 1) referring to their mode of ‘wearing the hair 
in a braid on the right side.’ See Kaparda.

दक्षिणा
दक्षिणा
 appears repeatedly in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 as the 
designation of the gift presented to priests at the sacrifice, 
apparently because a cow — a prolific (dakṣiṇā) one — was the 
usual ‘fee’
	3 on such an occasion.
	4 The later Dāna-stutis, or 
‘Praises of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda immensely exaggerate these 
donations, and the exaggeration grows in the Brāhmaṇas. It 
is important to notice that these enumerations of gifts in the 
main include nothing but articles of personal property, such as 
kine, horses, buffaloes, or camels (uṣṭra), ornaments, and so 
forth, but not land.
	5 Reference is, however, made in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	6 to land as a Dakṣiṇā, but with dis
approval, probably because the land came to be regarded as 
inalienable without the consent of the clansmen.
	7 1) A whole hymn, Rv. x. 107, is 
devoted to its praise. Cf. i. 168, 7; vi. 
27, 8; viii. 24, 29; 39, 5; x. 62, 1, etc. 2) Av. iv. 11, 4; v. 7, 11; xi. 7, 9; 
8, 22; xiii. 1, 52; xviii. 4, 8, etc.; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 7, 3, 1; 8, 1, 1; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 19, 23; xix. 30; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 3 et seq.; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 3, 1 et seq. 
The verses (gāthā nārāśaṃsī, either as 
a single expression or as two separate 
terms) used to win these Dakṣiṇās were 
notoriously false. See Kāṭhaka Saṃ
hitā, xiv. 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 
2, 6. 7; Nirukta, i. 7; xi. 2. 3) The transition of meaning is similar 
in the use of the English word ‘fee’; 
‘cattle,’ ‘money,’ ‘payment for service’ 
(see Murray's English Dictionary, 
s.v. ‘fee’). Cf. also Go-dāna, n. 4. 4) Cf. the rule that when nothing is 
specified a cow is the Dakṣiṇā, Kāty
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 2, 13; Lāṭy
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, viii. 1, 2. 5) So, e.g., Rv. i. 126, 1-4; v. 30, 
12-15; viii. 1, 32. 33; 3, 21 et seq.; 
4, 19-21; 5, 37-39; 6, 46-48; 55; 56; 
vii. 18, 21-24, and the full list in 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 
3, 273-277. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
10, 49 et seq. Clothes (vāsas) and gold 
are mentioned as a Dakṣiṇā in Av. ix. 5, 
14. The four Dakṣiṇās, according to 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 4, 7, 
are gold, a cow, clothes, and a horse. 
This is practically exhaustive if the 
trappings of the horse and ornaments 
are included. 6) xiii. 7, 1, 13, with which compare 
xiii. 6, 2, 18, where the Brahmin's land 
is excluded; and see xiii. 7, 1, 15, where 
the gift of land is disapproved. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 1, 4.

दक्षिणापथ
दक्षिणा-पथ
 (lit., ‘the road to the south’), ‘the south 
country,’ is found, probably as a designation of the Deccan, 
as early as the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,
	1 coupled with 
Surāṣṭra. A similar expression is dakṣiṇā padā, ‘with south
ward foot,’ in the Rigveda,
	2 referring to the place where the exile 
(parā-vṛj) goes on being expelled. This no doubt simply means 
‘the south’ beyond the limits of the recognized Āryan world, 
which even as late as the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	3 appears as 
bounded by the Vindhyas on the south. 1) i. 1, 2, 13. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 394, n., and Baudhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, 
v. 13. 2) x. 61, 8. 3) ii. 13.

Davids, Buddhist India, 30; Keith 
Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 28, n. 1; Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka, 200.

दक्षिणाप्रष्टि
दक्षिणा-प्रष्टि
 denotes ‘the side horse on the right.’ It 
appears from two passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 that 
there were at times four horses yoked to the chariot, the right 
and the left yoke horse (dakṣiṇā-yugya, savyā-yugya) in the middle, 
flanked by one on each side, the two latter of course not being 
fastened to the yoke at all, but presumably by traces alongside 
of the yoke horses. See Ratha. 1) v. 1, 4, 9; ix. 4, 2, 11 (this passage appears to speak of three horses only, 
but of. v. 4, 3, 17). Cf. also Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12.

दक्षिणायन
दक्षिणायन

दक्षिणायुग्य
दक्षिणा-युग्य,
 ‘the yoke horse on the right,’ is mentioned 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 1, 4, 6; 4, 3, 8; ix. 4, 2, 11). 
See Ratha.

दण्ड
दण्ड,
 ‘staff.’ (a) This word is often mentioned in the 
ordinary sense; for example, when used for driving cattle
	1 
(go-ajanāsaḥ), or as a weapon.
	2 A staff was given to a man 
on consecration for driving away demons, according to the 
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	3 The staff also played a part in the 
initiation (upanayana) of a youth on attaining manhood.
	4 In 
a modified sense the word is used to denote the handle of a 
ladle or similar implement.
	5 
(b) The ‘staff’ as the symbol of temporal power, implying 
punishment, is applied by the king (rāja-preṣito daṇḍaḥ).
	1 The 
king, in modern phraseology, was the source of criminal law; 
and he clearly retained this branch of law in his own hands 
even in later times.
	2 The punishment of the non-guilty 
(a-daṇḍya) is given as one of the characteristics of the non
Brahminical Vrātyas in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	3 See 
also Dharma. 1) Rv. vii. 33, 6. 2) Av. v. 5, 4. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,

दण्डऔपर
दण्ड औपर
 (‘descendant of Upara’) is mentioned in the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vi. 2, 9, 4) and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 
(iii. 8, 7) as having performed a certain rite.

दत्त तापस
 was Hotṛ priest at the snake festival described 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

दधि
दधि,
 ‘sour milk,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 mentions in order 
Ghrta (‘clarified butter’), Dadhi, Mastu, which Eggeling
	4 
renders ‘whey,’ and Āmikṣā, ‘curds.’ Dadhi often has the 
meaning of ‘curds’ also. It was used for mixing with Soma.
	5 1) viii. 2, 9; ix. 87, 1, etc. 2) Av. iii. 12, 7; iv. 34, 6; Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 3, 4, etc.; Pañcaviṃśa

ii. 348. 4) Sacred Books of the East, 12, 218. 5) Dadhyāśir, ‘mixed with sour milk,’ 
is an epithet of Soma in Rv. i. 5, 5;

brandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 219 et seq. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 227.

दध्यञ्चाथर्वण
दध्यञ्च् आथर्वण
 is a purely mythical sage. In the 
Rigveda
	1 he is clearly a divinity of some kind, but in the later 
Saṃhitās
	2 and the Brāhmaṇas
	3 he is metamorphosed into a 
teacher. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmana
	4 he is by oversight 
called an Āṅgirasa. 1) i. 80, 16; 84, 13, 14; 116, 12;

 See Dadhi and Soma.

दत्|दन्त्
दन्त्, दन्त,
 ‘tooth,’ is frequently mentioned from the 
Rigveda onwards.
	1 Cleansing (dhāv) the teeth was an ordinary 
act, especially in preparation for a sacrifice, and accompanied 
bathing, shaving of the hair and beard (keśa-śmaśru), and the 
cutting of the nails.
	2 A hymn of the Atharvaveda
	3 celebrates 
the appearance of the first two teeth of a child, though its 
exact interpretation is doubtful.
	4 In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	5 
there is a reference to a child's first teeth falling out. The 
word seems in the Rigveda
	6 once to denote an elephant's tusk. 
Whether dentistry was practised is doubtful. The occurrence 
in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	7 of Hiraṇya-dant, ‘gold-toothed,’ as 
the name of a man, is perhaps significant, especially as it is 
certain that the stopping of teeth with gold was known at 
Rome as early as the legislation of the Twelve Tables.

दभीति
दभीति
 appears several times in the Rigveda as a hero or 
sage. Indra overcomes on his behalf Cumuri and Dhuni;
	1 
he pressed Soma for Indra,
	2 who rewarded him.
	3 For him 
30,000 Dāsas were sent to sleep,
	4 and for him the Dasyus were 
bound without cords.
	5 Dabhīti also appears, with Turvīti, as 
a protégé of the Aśvins.
	6 There seems no reason to deny that 
he was a real person.

157, 158. 
Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 
p. 162.

दम
दम,
 ‘house,’ is a word that occurs several times in the 
Rigveda.
	1 It denotes, according to Roth,
	2 the place in which 
a man wields uncontrolled power (from the root dam, ‘control’). 1) i. 1, 8; 61, 9; 75, 5; 143, 4; ii. 1, 2, 
etc.; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 24. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But 
this seems very doubtful in view of the 
apparent connexion of  and , 
‘build,’ in Greek.

दम्पति
दम्-पति
 denotes ‘the master of the house’
	1 in the Rigveda,
	2 
but is more often used in the dual to designate ‘the master 
and the mistress,’
	3 an expression that may legitimately be 
deemed to show the high status of women at the time of the 
Rigveda. See Strī. 1) For the form, cf. Macdonell, Vedic 
Grammar, p. 37, n. 9. Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 2. 307 et seq., argues in favour 
of the spelling daṃpati (adopted by 
Geldner in his Ṛgveda, Glossar). Cf.

दर्भ
दर्भ
 is the name of a grass in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
In the Atharvaveda it is used for the calming of anger (manyu- 
śamana),
	3 and as an amulet for protection against the scattering 
of one's hair or the striking of one's breast.
	4 It is also said to 
be ‘rich in roots’ (bhūri-mūla),
	5 to possess a thousand leaves 
(sahasra-parṇa) and a hundred stalks (śata-kāṇḍa).

varieties of grass). 2) Av. vi. 43, 2; viii. 7, 20; x. 4, 13;

दर्वि
दर्वि,
 or Darvī, properly denotes a ‘ladle,’ in which sense it 
is found in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 But the word also means 
a serpent's ‘hood’ in the Atharvaveda,
	3 though Zimmer regards 
it as the name of a serpent. 
^4 Altindisches Leben, 95, where he 
takes Karikrata also as the name of a 
snake. 1) v. 6, 9; x. 105, 10. 2) Av. iii. 10, 7; iv. 14, 7; ix. 6, 17, etc. 3) x. 1, 13. See Whitney, Translation

दर्विदा
दर्विदा,
 the ‘woodpecker,’ is mentioned as a victim at the 
Aśvamedha or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda.
	1 Cf. Dārvā- 
ghāta. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1;

burg Dictionary, s.v., suggests ‘wood
piercer’ (dāru-vidha) as the literal sense. 
On the etymology, cf. F. W. Thomas's 
article. ‘The D.Suffix,’ p. 121, in 
Transactions of the Cambridge Philological 
Society, 5, part ii.

दर्श
दर्श
 (‘appearance’) denotes the new moon day,
	1 usually in 
opposition to the day of full moon (pūrṇa-māsa).
	2 Most 
frequently the word occurs in the compound
	3 darśa-pūrṇa- 
māsau, ‘new and full moon,’ the days of special ritual impor
tance.
	4 The order of the first two words here is worthy of 
note, for it distinctly suggests, though it does not conclusively 
prove, that the month was reckoned from new moon to new 
moon, not from full moon to full moon. See Māsa. 1) Av. vii. 81, 3, 4; Taittirīya Brāh

दशग्व
दश-ग्व
 appears in one hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as the name 
of a person who was assisted by Indra. The other references 
in that work,
	2 however, clearly show the mythical character 
of the Daśagvas, and of any individual among them. 1) viii. 12, 2 2) They are mentioned with the 
Navagvas in i. 62, 4; iii. 39, 5; iv. 51, 4; 
v. 29, 12; x. 62, 6, and alone in ii. 34, 
12. See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 
p. 144 (C).

दशतयी
दशतयी
 in the Nirukta
	1 frequently denotes the text of the 
Rigveda as divided into ten Maṇḍalas. 1) vii. 8. 20; xi. 16; xii. 40.

दशद्यु
दश-द्यु
 appears twice in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of a 
hero, but nothing can be made out regarding him or his 
relation to Vetasu, who is mentioned in one passage along 
with him. 1) i. 33, 14; vi. 26, 4. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen 
Gesellschaft, 55, 328.

दशन्
दशन्,
 ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the 
Vedic Indians, as it does of the Āryan people generally. But 
it is characteristic of India
	1 that there should be found at a 
very early period long series of names for very high numerals, 
whereas the Āryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	2 the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000 
(ayuta); 100,000 (niyuta); 1,000,000 (prayuta); 10,000,000 (arbuda); 
100,000,000 (nyarbuda); 1,000,000,000 (samudra); 10,000,000,000 
(madhya); 100,000,000,000 (anta); 1,000,000,000,000 (parārdha). 
In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	3 the list is the same, but niyuta and 
prayuta exchange places, and after nyarbuda a new figure 
(badva) intervenes, thus increasing samudra to 10,000,000,000, 
and so on. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā has in two places
	4 exactly 
the same list as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā
	5 has the list ayuta, prayuta, then ayuta again, arbuda, 
nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, parārdha. The Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	6 has the Vājasaneyi list up to nyarbuda inclusive, 
then follow nikharvaka, badva, akṣita, and apparently go = 
1,000,000,000,000. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	7 list 
replaces nikharvaka by nikharva, badva by padma, and ends 
with akṣitir vyomāntaḥ. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	8 con
tinues the series after nyarbuda with nikharvāda, samudra, 
salila, antya, ananta (= 10 billions). 
But beyond ayuta
	9 none of these numbers has any vitality. 
Badva, indeed, occurs in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	10 but it 
cannot there have any precise numerical sense;
	11 and later on 
the names of these high numerals are very much confused. 
An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	12 where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts 
in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the 
preceding one. It begins with dvādaśa-mānaṃ hiraṇyam, ‘gold 
to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the 
Kṛṣṇala),
	13 followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 
768, 1,536, 3072,’ then dve aṣṭāviṃśati-śata-māne, which must 
mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single māna, but 
a number of 24 mānas) = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152, 
98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be 
compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	14 where a day is divided into 
15 muhūrtas — 1 muhūrta = 15 kṣipras, 1 kṣipra = 15 etarhis, 
1 etarhi = 15 idānis, 1 idāni = 15 prāṇas. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	15 has a decimal division of the day into 15 muhūrtas — 
1 muhūrta = 10 nimeṣas, 1 nimeṣa = 10 dhvaṃsis. 
Few fractions are mentioned in Vedic literature. Ardha, 
pāda, śapha, and kalā denote (1/2), (1/4), (1/8), (1/16) respectively, but only 
the first two are common. Tṛtīya denotes the third part.
	16 
In the Rigveda
	17 Indra and Viṣṇu are said to have divided 
1,000 by 3, though how they did so is uncertain. Tri-pād 
denotes ‘three-fourths.’
	18 
There is no clear evidence that the Indians of the Vedic 
period had any knowledge of numerical figures, though it is 
perfectly possible.

Altindisches Leben, 348, considers that 
it has not any definite sense in the 
Rigveda; this cannot be either proved 
or disproved. The Rv. has the phrase 
śatā sahasrāṇi several times (iv. 32, 
18; viii. 32, 18, etc.) = 100,000; and 
ayuta may easily have been already 
specialized, though it may also have 
retained a vague sense. 10) vii. 21. 23. 11) Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 96. 12) xviii. 3. Cf. Lāṭyāyana Śrauta

numerical signs would be certain. Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 234, 235,

दशपुरुषंराज्य
दश-पुरुषं-राज्य,
 occurring in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 
doubtless
	2 means ‘sovereignty inherited through ten ancestors,’ 
a striking case of hereditary rule. Weber
	3 once rendered the 
word as the ‘kingdom
	4 of Daśapuru,’ comparing the Daśapura 
of Kālidāsa's Meghadūta
	5 and the Daśārṇa of the ‘middle 
country.’ 1) xii. 9, 3, 1. 3. 2) Cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 3;

St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and 
Eggeling Sacred Books of the East, 
44, 269, have the correct rendering. 3) Indische Studien, 1, 209. But see 10,

always spelt with m, not ṃ; cf. Mac

दशमास्य
दश-मास्य,
 ‘ten months old,’ describes in the Rigveda
	1 
and later
	2 the embryo immediately before birth. See Māsa. 1) v. 78, 7-8. 2) Av. i. 11, 6; iii. 23, 2. There are 
several references in Vedic literature 
to birth in the tenth month, as Rv. 
x. 184, 3, etc.

दशमी
दशमी
 denotes in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 the period of life between 90 and 100 years 
which the Rigveda
	3 calls the daśama yuga, ‘the tenth stage 
of life.’ Longevity seems not to have been rare among the 
Vedic Indians, for the desire to live a ‘hundred autumns’ 
(śaradaḥ śatam) is constantly expressed.
	4 Dīrghatamas is said 
to have lived 100 years,
	5 and Mahidāsa Aitareya is credited 
with 116.
	6 Onesikritos
	7 reported that they sometimes lived 
130 years, a statement with which corresponds the wish 
expressed in the Jātaka
	8 for a life of 120 years. Probably the 
number was always rather imaginary than real, but the com
parative brevity of modern life in India
	9 may be accounted for 
by the cumulative effect of fever, which is hardly known to the 
Rigveda. See Takman. 1) iii. 4, 7. 2) xxii. 14. 3) i. 158, 6. 4) Rv. i. 89, 9; x. 18, 10, and passim.

दशवृक्ष
दश-वृक्ष
 is the name of a tree, according to Roth,
	1 in 
the Atharvaveda.
	2 But Whitney
	3 treats the word as a mere 
adjective meaning ‘of ten trees.’ 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) ii. 9, 1. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
50.

दशव्रज
दश-व्रज
 is the name of a protégé of the Aśvins in the 
Rigveda (viii. 8, 20; 49, 1; 50, 9).

दशशिप्र
दश-शिप्र
 is the name of a sacrificer mentioned in the 
Rigveda.
	1 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

दशा
दशा
 denotes the ‘fringe’ or ‘border’ of a garment (vāsaḥ) 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The word also occurs in the 
compound daśā-pavitra,
	2 which means ‘a filtering cloth with 
a fringe.’ 1) iii. 3, 2, 9, and often in the Sūtras. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 32; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 2, 2, 11. Cf. iv. 1, 
1. 28.

दशोणि
दशोणि
 appears in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 apparently 
as a favourite of Indra and as opposed to the Paṇis, who fell 
in hundreds for his benefit. The view of Ludwig
	2 that he is 
here the priest of the Paṇis is very improbable. Elsewhere 
his name is simply mentioned.

दशोण्य
दशोण्य
 is the name of a sacrificer mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
along with Daśaśipra and others. Whether he is identical 
with Daśoṇi cannot be decided. 1) viii. 52, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

दशोनसि
दशोनसि
 is the name of a kind of snake in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
The reading of the Paippalāda recension is Naśonaśī. 1) x. 4, 17. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 577.

दस्यवेवृक
दस्यवे वृक,
 ‘wolf to the Dasyu,’ is the name of a man 
mentioned four times in the Rigveda.
	1 In one hymn
	2 he is 
called a Ṛṣi, but in two others
	3 he is clearly a prince victorious 
over the Dasyus, and a generous patron of the singer. It is 
hardly necessary to assume different persons,
	4 for the term Ṛṣi 
is not altogether inconsistent with royalty. He was son of 
Pūtakratu
	5 and Pūtakratā,
	6 his wife. 1) viii. 51, 2; 55, 1; 56, 1. 2. 2) viii. 51. 3) viii. 55. 56. 4) Especially as the name occurs only 
in the small collection of Kāṇva hymns 
forming the Vālakhilya group in the 
eighth Maṇḍala. 5) viii. 56, 2. Pautakrata. Cf. viii. 68, 
17. 6) viii. 56, 4. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 139, 164; 5, 552.

दस्यवेसह
दस्यवे सह
 is, according to Roth,
	1 the name of a man 
or a clan in the Rigveda.
	2 But he admits that the words may 
be an epithet of Agni. This is the interpretation given to them 
by Oldenberg.
	3 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) i. 36, 18. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 33.

दस्यु
दस्यु,
 a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many 
passages of the Rigveda
	1 clearly applied to superhuman 
enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in 
which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated. 
This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the 
Dasyu is opposed to the Āryan, who defeats him with the aid 
of the gods.
	2 The great difference between the Dasyus and 
the Āryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not 
sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘god
hating,’ and so forth.
	3 As compared with the Dāsa, they are 
less distinctively a people: no clans (viśaḥ) of the Dasyus are 
mentioned, and while Indra's dasyu-hatya, ‘slaughter of the 
Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of 
dāsa-hatya. That the Dasyus were real people is, however, 
shown by the epithet anās applied to them in one passage of the 
Rigveda.
	5 The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the 
Pada text and Sāyaṇa both take it to mean ‘without face’ (an-ās),
	6 
but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ (a-nās), is quite possible,
	7 
4 Rv. i. 51, 5, 6; 103, 4; x. 95, 7; 
99, 7; 105, 11. Cf. dasyu-han. ‘Dasyu
slaying,’ i. 100, 12; vi. 45, 24; viii. 76, 
11; 77, 3; x. 47, 4 (all of Indra); 
vi. 16, 15; viii. 39, 8 (of Agni), etc. 
and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the 
Dravidian
	8 type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis, 
who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would 
receive some support from Vṛtra's being called ‘broken-nosed’ 
if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word rujānās.
	9 
The other epithet of the Dasyus is mṛdhra-vāc, which 
occurs with anās,
	10 and which has been rendered
	11 ‘of stam
mering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no 
means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere
	12 applied 
to Āryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile 
speech.’ 
Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian daṅhu, daqyu, which 
denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer
	13 thinks that the original 
meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the 
sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’ 
while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ ex
tended it to include demon foes. Roth
	14 considers that the 
meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods 
and demons. Lassen
	15 attempted to connect the contrast 
daqyu: dasyu with that of daeva: deva, and to see in it a result 
of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory, 
had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may 
have originally meant ‘ravaged land’
	16 as a result of invasion; 
hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human 
foes were more usually called by the cognate name of Dāsa. 
Individual Dasyus are Cumuri, Śambara, Śuṣṇa, etc. 
In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	17 the word has, as later,
	18 the 
sense of uncivilized peoples generally. 1) i. 34, 7; 100, 18; ii. 13, 9, etc. 
See Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 157, 
158. 2) Rv. i. 51, 8; 103, 3; 117, 21; 
ii. 11, 18, 19; iii. 34, 9; vi. 18, 3; 
vii. 5, 6; x. 49, 3. Probably also in 
v. 70, 3; x. 83, 6, people are meant. 3) The Dasyu is called a-karman, ‘rite
less,’ x. 22, 8; a-devayu, ‘indifferent to 
the gods,’ viii. 70, 11; a-brahman, 
‘without devotion,’ iv. 16, 9; a-yajvan, 
‘not sacrificing,’ viii. 70, 11; a-yajyu, 
id., vii. 6, 3; a-vrata, ‘lawless,’ i. 51, 
8; 175, 3; vi. 14, 3; ix. 41, 2; anya- 
vrata, ‘following strange ordinances,’ 
viii. 70, 11; deva-pīyu, ‘reviling the 
gods,’ Av. xii. 1, 37. It is impossible 
in all cases to be certain that people 
are meant. 5) Rv. v. 29, 10. 6) This sense allows of two inter
pretations: ‘misfeatured,’ which seems 
that of Roth, St. Petersburg Dic
tionary, s.v., and Grassmann, Wörter- 
buch; or ‘speechless’ (that is, unable 
to speak the language of the Āryans), 
which is that of Bollensen, Zeitschrift 
der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell- 
schaft, 41, 496. 7) This view is supported by Mega
sthenes' report as to natives who were : see Strabo, p. 711; Pliny, 
Nat. Hist., vii. 2, 18, cited by Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 430. See also Ludwig, 
Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 109; 
5, 95; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 
3, 277; Knauer, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 29, 
52; Wackernagel, Altindische Gram- 
matik, 2, 293 (accent). 8) The suggestion in the Indian Empire, 
1, 390, that the modern Brahui type is 
the true Dravidian, while the modern 
Dravidian is the result of fusion with 
Muṇḍā-speaking tribes, would render 
this theory improbable. But it seems 
more probable that the Brahuis in 
speech preserve the tradition of Dra
vidian settlements in North India. 9) See Bloomfield, American Journal of 
Philology, 17, 415 (who takes rujānāḥ of 
Rv. i. 32, 8, as = rujāna-nāḥ); Olden
berg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 31, 32 (who 
suggests as possible the analysis of the 
word as rujā-anāḥ). But cf. Lanman, 
Sanskrit Reader, 361, who suggests the 
emendation rujānaḥ as nominative 
singular of the simple participle 
‘broken’; Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 
p. 59, n. 1. 10) Rv. v. 29, 10. 11) Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 393 
et seq. 12) The expression is used of the 
Āryan Pūrus in vii. 18, 13; of the Paṇis 
in vii. 6, 3; and of hostile persons in 
i. 174, 2; v. 32, 8; x. 23, 5. Roth, 
Erläuterungen zum Nirukta, 97, thinks 
the sense is ‘of insulting speech,’ and 
Zimmer, op. cit., 114, 115, strongly 
supports this view. But Hillebrandt, 
op. cit., 1, 89, 90, 114, prefers to see in 
it ‘speaking an enemy's speech,’ and 
thinks that the Pūrus were dialectically 
different from the Bharatas — a view 
which can be supported from the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23, 24, 
where the Asuras say he'lavo (= he'rayo, 
‘ho, enemies,’ in Sanskrit). See Muir, 
op. cit., 2^2, 114; Davidson, Zeitschrift 
der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell- 
schaft, 37, 23 (the Mahābhāṣya version); 
Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 26, 
31, n. 3. The word could thus apply 
to the Dasyus also, as the strange 
speech of the enemy could be either 
Āryan or aboriginal. 13) Op. cit., 110 et seq. So Macdonell, 
Vedic Mythology, p. 158. 14) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 15) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 633

credited. Cf. Justi, Göttingische Gelehrte

Vedische Studien, 1, 142; Oldenberg, 
Religion des Veda, 162 et seq.; Macdonell, 
Vedic Mythology, p. 156. 16) Both this word and Dāsa appear 
to be derived from the root das, which, 
according to Whitney, Roots, means 
‘lay waste’; but, according to Roth, 
‘suffer want,’ ‘waste away.’ 17) vii. 18, where the descendants of

दाक्षायण
दाक्षायण,
 ‘descendant of Dakṣa.’ The Dākṣāyaṇas are 
mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 
as having given gold to Śatānīka. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 
the word is actually used to denote ‘gold.’ The Dākṣāyaṇas 
appear there
	3 as a race of princes who, because of performing 
a certain rite, prospered down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa 
itself. 1) Av. i. 35, 1, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃ
hitā, xxxiv. 51, 52; Kaṭha, cited by 
von Schroeder, Tūbinger Kaṭha-Hand- 
schriften, 36; Khila, iv. 7, 7, 8. 2) vi. 7, 4, 2: dākṣāyaṇa-hasta, ‘golden
hande.’ Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 41, 283, n. 2, seems unnecessarily 
doubtful as to this. 3) ii. 4, 4, 6. Cf. Artareya Brāhmaṇa,

Doctrine du Sacrifice, 138.

दात्यौह
दात्यौह,
 a ‘gallinule,’ is mentioned in the list of victims 
at the Aśvamedha, or horse sacrifice, in the Yajurveda.
	1 The 
word is clearly a variant of dātyūha, which occurs in the epics 
and law books. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 6; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25. 39. Pāṇini, 
vii. 3. 1, derives the word from ditya-vah. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 91.

दात्र
दात्र
 (‘cutter’), denoting a ‘sickle,’ is mentioned in the 
Rigveda.
	1 Cows ‘with sickle-shaped marks on their ears’ 
(dātra-karṇyaḥ) are referred to in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.
	2 
Otherwise the expression is only found later, occurring in the 
Sūtra and epic literature.
	3 See also Sṛṇi. 1) viii. 78, 10; Nirukta, ii. 1. 2) iv. 2, 9. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 17, 86. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238.

दात्रेय
दात्रेय
 is the patronymic of Arāḍa Śaunaka in the Vaṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Possibly Dārteya, ‘descendant of Dṛti,’ should 
be read,
	2 but the word may have the same derivation as the 
latter form with metathesis. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. 2) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

दाधीच
दाधीच,
 ‘descendant of Dadhyanc,’ is the patronymic of 
Cyavana in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 6).

दान
1. Dāna, ‘giving,’ ‘gift,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in 
the Rigveda, especially in the Dāna-stutis
	1 (‘Praises of Gifts’) 
of generous patrons (see Dakṣiṇā). One of the characteristics 
of the Brāhmaṇa is his right to receive gifts, which it is 
obligatory on the other castes to present.
	2 The gift of a 
daughter (kanyāyā dānam) was a form of marriage
	3 (see Vivāha), 
because in it the girl was ‘given’ away by her father or 
brother. 1) The term seems first to occur in 
the Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 45, 92, and in 
similar works. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 7, 1; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 47-61. 3) Nirukta, iii. 4.

दान
2. Dāna (‘distribution’)
	1 seems in several passages of the 
Rigveda
	2 to be a designation of the sacrificial feast to which 
the god is invited (cf. ). In one passage
	3 Sāyaṇa 
thinks that it denotes the mada-jalāni, ‘drops of water falling 
from the temples of a rutting elephant,’
	4 but this is doubtful. 
In another passage
	5 Roth thinks that ‘pasture land’ is meant. 1) From dā, ‘divide.’ 2) i. 55, 7; 48, 4; 180, 5; viii. 46, 26; 
60, 8; 99, 4, etc. Cf., however, Pischel 
Vedische Studien, 1, 100. 3) Rv. viii. 33, 8; Ludwig, Transla
tion of the Rigveda, 5, 157. 4) Dāna in this sense, so common in 
the post-Vedic language, is probably 
derived from dā, ‘divide,’ meaning 
originally ‘secretion.’ 5) ii. 13, 7.

दान
3. Dāna is in three passages of the Rigveda
	1 held by Roth 
to designate a chariot horse. 1) v. 27, 5; vii. 18, 23; viii. 46, 24. 
But in all these cases ‘gifts’ seems an 
adequate version, ‘horses’ being under
stood.

दामन्
दामन्,
 a ‘rope’ or ‘girdle,’
	1 is often mentioned in the 
Rigveda and later.
	2 Reference is made to the rope of the 
sacrificial horse,
	3 as well as to the practice of tying calves with 
ropes.
	4 The word occurs in the sense of a ‘band’ of horse hair 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	5 1) Originally ‘bond,’ from dā, ‘bind.’ 2) Rv. i. 56, 3, etc.; Av. vi. 63, 1; 
103, 2; vii. 103, 1. 2; Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, ii. 4, 13, 1, etc. 3) Rv. i. 162, 8. 4) Rv. ii. 28, 7. 5) v. 3, 1, 10. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 2.

दाय
दाय
 occurs in the Rigveda
	1 only in the sense of ‘reward’ 
of exertion (śrama), but later it means ‘inheritance’ — that is, 
a father's property which is to be divided among his sons 
either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all 
negative the idea that the property of the family was legally 
family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head 
of the house, usually the father, and that the other members 
of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father 
could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they 
were physically stronger. 
Thus Manu is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	2 to have divided 
his property among his sons. He omitted Nābhānediṣṭha, 
whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and 
to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the 
property he divided was movable property, rather than land 
(Urvarā). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 the division is said to 
have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left 
only their aged father to Nābhānediṣṭha. According to the 
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,
	4 again, four sons divided the inheritance 
while their old father, Abhipratārin, was still alive. It is, 
of course, possible to regard Dāya as denoting the heritable 
property of the family, but the developed patria potestas of the 
father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend 
of Śunaḥśepa, is inconsistent with the view that the sons 
were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they 
actually insisted on a division of the property.
	5 Probably — 
there is no evidence of any decisive character — land was not 
divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the 
analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the 
available supply of arable land became limited. 
As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	6 that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps 
this was always the case after death. During the father's life
time another might be preferred, as appears from a passage 
of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	7 Women were excluded from 
partition or inheritance, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	8 
and the Nirukta.
	9 They were, no doubt, supported by their 
brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prosti
tution.
	10 Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Sūtras.
	11 
The heir is called Dayada,
	12 ‘receiver (ā-da) of inheritance.’ 1) x. 114, 10. 2) iii. 1, 9, 4 et seq. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 1^2, 191-194; Lévi, La Doctrine du 
Sacrifice, 67, 68. 3) v. 14. 4) iii. 156 (Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 26, 61, 62). 5) The same question has been raised 
as to the origin of English or Teutonic 
property in land generally. Against 
any idea even of family ownership in 
a strict sense of the word, see Fustel 
de Coulanges, Recherches sur quelques 
Problèmes d'Histoire, 322 et seq.; Ashley, 
in Fustel de Coulanges, Origin of Pro- 
perty in Land, xvi-xxi; Pollock and 
Maitland, History of English Law, 2, 237 
et seq. The older view, which accepted 
family and communal ownership, repre
sented in different forms by Maine (Vil- 
lage Communities in the East and West), 
Stubbs, Green, and others, is defended 
in a new form by Vinogradoff, Villanage 
in England. See also Keith, Journal 
of the African Society, 6, 201 et seq. 
Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 93-96, does not 
accept the communal ownership of land, 
but, ibid., 80, is inclined to believe in 
the joint ownership of a family. He 
admits that this is inconsistent with the 
strict rule of patria potestas, which still 
exists in Bengal; Baden Powell, Village 
Communities in India, 133 et seq., doubts 
the existence in early India of such a 
patria potestas. But the facts seem clearly 
to show that there was such a power, 
and that the father owned the property. 
His sons, as they grew up, came to 
claim the property, and he might have 
to divide it; hence the idea naturally 
developed that every child on birth had 
a legal share in the property. No doubt 
also from the first the right to part with 
land was one which grown-up sons and 
the rest of the community could object 
to, once the village had acquired a fixed 
existence. This would account ade
quately for the later system. Cf. also 
pp. 100, n. 19; 336, n. 7, and Rājanya. 6) ii. 5, 2, 7. 7) xvi. 4, 4. 8) iv. 4, 2, 13. 9) iii. 4. 10) Cf. Ztrī. 11) Inheritance is also alluded to in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17; Śāṅkh
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27, 3; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 2, 22; iii. 2, 1, 18. 
For the Sūtra rules, see Jolly, Recht 
und Sitte, 80 et seq. 12) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 4, 3, 9; 
Nirukta, iii. 4; metaphorically, Av. 
v. 18, 6, 14.

दार
दार,
 ‘wife,’ is found in the Sūtras (usually as a plural 
masculine), and once (as a singular) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad.
	1 1) vi. 4, 12 (where dvāreṇa is a varia 
lectio; see St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v.). Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 415, 416, who 
ignores the Bṛhadāraṇyaka passage.

दारु
दारु,
 ‘wood,’ is frequently mentioned in the Rigveda and 
later,
	1 denoting amongst other things the pole of a chariot,
	2 
logs as fuel,
	3 the wooden parts of a car,
	4 possibly wooden 
stocks,
	5 and so forth. 1) Rv. vi. 3, 4; x. 145, 4, etc.; Av. 
x. 4, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 3, 
etc. 2) Rv. x. 102, 8. 3) Rv. viii. 102, 20. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 6, 2, 14. 5) Av. vi. 121, 2. But this is doubtful.

Dṛḍhajayanta Lauhitya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 
(iii. 42, 1).

दार्तेय
दार्तेय,
 ‘descendant of Dṛti.’ The Dārteyas are mentioned

	2 1) xxxi. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 473). 2) xxv. 3, 6.

दार्भ्य
दार्भ्य,
 ‘descendant of Darbha,’ is mentioned in a verse 
of the Rigveda.
	1 Roth
	2 identifies him with Śyāvāśva, but the 
Bṛhaddevatā
	3 with Rathavīti. The same patronymic is 
frequently
	4 connected with Keśin, and is also applied to 
Rathaprota.
	5 See also Dālbhya. 1) v. 61, 17. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) v. 50. 77. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 2, 3;

Saṃhitā, xlvi. 5, has Darbhasya. Dālbhi 
is found, however, in Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
x. 6.

दाव
दाव,
 ‘forest fire,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the latter work such fires are 
referred to as occurring in spring. According to Sieg,
	3 a hymn 
of the Rigveda
	4 describes a forest fire. Watchers were 
employed to guard against surprise from such conflagrations

दाश
दाश,
 ‘fisherman,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the

Dhaivara. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. Weber,

दाशराज्ञ
दाश-राज्ञ
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 and the Athar
vaveda
	2 of Sudās' famous ‘battle with the ten kings.’ It is 
somewhat difficult to make out exactly who the kings were 
(see Turvaśa), but the number is probably a round one, and 
cannot be pressed. The actual battle hymn
	3 does not contain 
the word, and the passages in which it is found may reasonably 
be considered late.
	4 1) vii. 33, 2, 5; 83, 8. 2) x. 128, 12. 3) 8, 18 4) Cf. for the late date of vii. 33,

Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 130, opposes 
this view, but not convincingly.

दाशर्म
दाशर्म
 appears in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	1 as a teacher and 
a contemporary of Āruṇi. 1) vii. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 472.

दास
दास,
 like Dasyu, sometimes denotes enemies of a demoniac 
character in the Rigveda,
	1 but in many passages
	2 the word 
refers to human foes of the Āryans. The Dāsas are described 
as having forts (puraḥ),
	3 and their clans (viśaḥ) are mentioned.
	4 
It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’ 
(śaradīḥ),
	5 may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the 
epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn 
season. The Dāsa colour (Varṇa)
	6 is probably an allusion to 
the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly men
tioned.
	7 The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called anās, ‘nose
less’(?),
	8 and mṛdhra-vāc, ‘of hostile speech,’
	9 and are probably 
meant by the phallus-worshippers (śiśna-devāḥ, ‘whose deity 
is a phallus’) of the Rigveda.
	10 It is significant that constant 
reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva 
and Dāsa or Dasyu.
	11 
Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the 
word Dāsa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the 
Rigveda.
	12 Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from 
the Atharvaveda
	13 onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt, 
the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle 
they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would 
sometimes also become concubines; thus Kavaṣa was taunted 
with being the son of a female slave (dāsyāḥ putraḥ) in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	14 
Ludwig
	15 considers that in some passages
	16 Dāsa is applied, 
in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain. 
Zimmer
	17 and Meyer
	18 think that Dāsa
	19 originally meant 
‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of 
the Dahae
	20 of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a desig
nation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt
	21 
argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together,
	22 
they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying 
the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda 
with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer 
of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and 
especially those in which Divodāsa — ‘the heavenly Dāsa’ — plays 
an important part,
	23 to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this 
by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as 
quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which 
Sudās, the Bharatas, Vasiṣṭha, and Viśvāmitra appear. The 
Sarasvatī of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the 
seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely 
doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa 
should have been a Dāsa, and yet have fought against other 
Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Sudās 
appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems 
unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river Sarasvati, 
which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’ 
The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable,
	24 but in 
civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever 
equal to the invaders.
	25 Leading Dāsas were Ilībiśa, Cumuri 
and Dhuni, Pipru, Varcin, Śambara. For names of aboriginal 
tribes, see Kirāta, Kīkaṭa, Caṇḍāla, Parṇaka, Śiṃyu. 1) Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology,

The Ārya colour is mentioned in iii. 34, 
9, and the Dāsa is contrasted with the 
Varṇa (of the singers) in i. 104, 2. The 
‘white-hued (śvitnya) friends’ who, in 
i. 100, 18, aid in the conquest of the 
Dasyu and Siṃyu are doubtless Āryans. 
In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30, 
the day and night (ahorātre) are 
paralleled with the Śūdrāryau — that is, 
probably with the Āryan and Śūdra 
(the compound is not to be taken as 
giving the words in the correct order; 
cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 268).

Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 2, 
suggests that in viii. 46, 32, the word 
dāsān, ‘slaves,’ should be read in place 
of dāse, qualifying Balbūtha. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 117, quotes the passage 
to indicate the admixture of Āryan and 
Dāsa blood. See also Av. iv. 9, 8; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 24, 2. It is 
uncertain whether dāsa-pravarga, as an 
epithet of rayi, ‘wealth,’ in Rv. i. 92, 8, 
means ‘consisting of troops of slaves.’ 
Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 82, so takes 
the expression in i. 158, 5. 13) Av. v. 22, 6; xii. 3, 13; 4, 9; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 13, 2; Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 10 (Mādhyaṃ
dina = 2, 7 Kāṇva). Zimmer, 107, sees 
this sense in vadhū in Rv. viii. 19, 36. 
See also Vadhūmant. 14) ii. 19; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xii. 3. 15) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 209. 16) See i. 158, 5; ii. 13, 8; iv. 30, 
14. 15; vi. 20, 10; vii. 99, 5; x. 49, 
6, 7. None of these passages need 
certainly be so taken. 17) Altindisches Leben, 110 et seq. 18) Geschichte des Altertums, 1, 515. 19) If derived from das in the sense 
of ‘lay waste’ (Whitney, Roots), the 
original meaning would have been 
‘devastator,’ ‘ravager.’ 20) The Dahae may have been closely 
allied in race and language with the 
Iranians, but this is not very clearly 
proved. Cf. E. Kuhn in Kuhn's Zeit- 
schrift, 28, 214; Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 1, 95. The possibility or 
probability of mixture with Mongolian 
blood is always present. So Zimmer, 
op. cit., 112, calls the Daoi or Daai of 
Herodotus, i. 126, a Turanian tribe. 21) Op. cit., 1, 94. 22) Rv. v. 34, 6. 7; vii. 6, 3 (Dasyu 
and Paṇi together); Av. v. 11, 6. 23) Op. cit., 1, 96 et seq., He argues 
that Dāsa occurs only four times in 
Maṇḍala vii., but eight times in vi., 
and that similarly Śambara, the Dāsa, 
is mentioned six times in vi., but only 
twice in vii. But Divodāsa much more 
probably means, as Oldenberg in
terprets the name, ‘the servant of 
heaven.’ See his Religion des Veda, 155, 
n. 1; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 
209; below, p. 363, n. 11. 24) Cf. Rv. i. 176, 4; iv. 30, 13;

Dāsas were often dwellers in moun
tains, a natural refuge for beaten 
tribes.

दासवेश
दास-वेश,
 occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 probably 
designates a Dāsa named Veśa. Sāyaṇa's interpretation of the

दिधिषु
दिधिषु

to the relative, probably brother-in-law,
	2 who takes the place 
of the husband at the funeral rite, and who, as in the Hebraic 
levirate, is to beget a child by the brother's wife if there is 
no son.
	3 Hillebrandt
	4 and Lanman
	5 consider that the word 
originally meant only ‘wooer,’ and applied to the king who, 
after the chief queen had lain beside the dead victim in the 
Puruṣamedha or ‘human sacrifice,’ claimed her again; but this 
view is hardly plausible.
	6 The term is also applied to the god 
Pūṣan
	7 as the wooer of his mother, apparently Sūryā.

दिधिषूपति
दिधिषू-पति
 occurs in the Kāṭhaka
	1 and Kapiṣṭhala Saṃ
hitās,
	2 as well as in the Āpastamba,
	3 Gautama,
	4 and Vasiṣṭha 
Dharma Sūtras,
	5 in lists of people who have committed sin 
(enas). The traditional rendering
	6 is ‘husband of a woman 
married a second time’; Manu
	7 seems to apply the term to the 
brother-in-law who is ‘married’ to his sister-in-law after his 
brother's death for the purpose of begetting a child, if he 
displays conjugal affection to her (anurajyate kāmataḥ).
	8 This 
sense would be possible, since Didhiṣu denotes a ‘wooer,’ and 
a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control 
her own choice of a spouse. But another tradition
	9 holds that 
Didhiṣū means the elder sister whose younger sister has 
married before her. This view is supported by a passage in the 
Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,
	10 and by the use of the word agre- 
didhiṣū-pati,
	11 which must mean the ‘husband of a younger 
sister married before the elder.’ In this case also Didhiṣū 
would mean ‘wooer,’ the elder sister being so called because, 
if her parents do not arrange a marriage for her, she is, 
according to Viṣṇu,
	12 to make her own choice of a husband 
(kuryāt svayaṃvaram). See also Edidhiṣuḥpati and Daidhi- 
ṣavya. 1) xxxi. 7, quoted in Delbrück, Die

दिव्
दिव्,
 ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided 
into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and 
‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ (div),
	1 or alternatively into ‘heaven and 
earth’ (dyāvā-pṛthivī),
	2 which two are then considered as com
prising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky. 
Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and 
similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages
	3 the vault 
(nāka) of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the 
celestial light (svar, jyotis). 
The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a three
fold division of the three elements — earth, air, and sky. Thus 
a highest (uttama,
	4 uttara,
	5 pārya
	6 ), a middle, and a lowest 
heaven are specified.
	4 In the Atharvaveda
	7 the three heavens 
are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ (udanvatī), as pīlumatī (of 
uncertain meaning), and as the pradyaus, where the Fathers sit. 
Heaven is frequently called vyoman as well as rocana
	8 (properly 
the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament 
which separates the visible upper world from the highest 
heaven is called, besides nāka, ‘vault,’ sānu, ‘summit,’ viṣṭap, 
‘surface,’ and pṛṣṭha, ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’
	9 or 
‘summit of the vault.’
	10 
Similarly three atmospheres (rajas), or oftener two, are 
alluded to,
	11 but the division here is merely artificial. In one 
passage
	12 six rajāṃsi, ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens 
and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the 
atmosphere is antarikṣa. 
The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad 
being probably the use of pṛthivī in the plural
	13 to denote the 
three divisions of the universe (just as pitarau, ‘two fathers,’ 
denotes ‘father and mother’).
	14 The earth is called kṣam, kṣā, 
gmā, or designated by the epithets mahī, ‘the great,’ pṛthivī or 
urvī, ‘the broad,’ uttānā, ‘the extended,’ and is regularly con
trasted as idam, ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere.
	15 
The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the 
Rigveda,
	16 and is expressly called ‘circular’ (pari-maṇḍala) in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	17 When earth is conjoined with 
heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls (camvā) turned 
towards each other.
	18 In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	19 the two are 
regarded as halves of an egg. The distance of heaven from 
the earth is given by the Atharvaveda
	20 as a thousand days' 
journey for the sun-bird, by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	21 as a 
thousand days' journey for a horse, while the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	22 whimsically estimates the distance as equivalent 
to a thousand cows standing one on the top of the other. 
According to Zimmer,
	23 the Vedic poets conceived the 
atmosphere to be above the earth in its upper division only, 
but below it in its lower stratum. The evidence,
	24 however, for 
the latter assumption is quite insufficient.
	25 The theory of 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	26 is that the sun merely reverses its 
bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon 
while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been 
shown
	25 that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also.

See also Sūrya and Candramās. For the Vedic knowledge 
of the planets, see Graha. 
There is no geographical division of the earth in Vedic 
literature. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	28 states that 
the centre of the earth is a span north of the Plakṣa Prāsravaṇā, 
and that the centre of the sky is the constellation of the seven 
Ṛṣis, the Great Bear. For the quarters, see Diś. 1) Rv. ii. 40; viii. 6, 15; 10, 6; 90,

दिवोदासअतिथिग्व
दिवोदास अतिथिग्व
 is one of the leading princes of the 
early Vedic age. He was a son of Vadhryaśva,
	1 and father, 
or more probably grandfather, of Sudās, the famous king of the 
Tṛtsu family, among the Bharatas. Probably Pijavana was 
the son and Sudās the grandson. Divodāsa was naturally a 
Bharata,
	2 and, like Sudās, was an opponent of the Turvaśas 
and Yadus.
	3 His great enemy was Śambara, the Dāsa, who 
was apparently chief of a mountain people,
	4 and whom he 
repeatedly defeated.
	5 He was also, it seems, like his father 
Vadhryaśva,
	6 an energetic supporter of the fire ritual, for Agni 
is once called by his name in the Rigveda.
	7 On the other hand, 
he was defeated, with Āyu and Kutsa, by Indra's aid. In 
several passages he seems closely connected with the singer 
family, the Bharadvājas.
	8 
From one passage,
	9 where Divodāsa is said to have fought 
against the Paṇis, the Pārāvatas, and Bṛsaya, Hillebrandt
	10 
has inferred that he was engaged in conflicts with the tribes 
of Arachosia, and interpreting the name as the ‘heavenly 
Dāsa’
	11 conjectures that he was himself a Dāsa. This con
clusion is not probable, for the Sarasvatī on which the battle 
in question took place, and which can hardly be the Haraqaiti 
of Arachosia, would naturally designate the later Sarasvatī, 
while the Pārāvatas are mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa,
	12 as in the east, about the Yamunā. Bergaigne's 
opinion
	13 that Divodāsa and Atithigva were different people 
cannot be supported in view of the complete parallelism in the 
acts of the two persons.
	14 See also Pratardana. 
The people of Divodāsa are referred to in a hymn of the 
Rigveda.

	4 Zimmer,
	5 and others, has 
been disproved by Grill,
	6 Bloomfield,
	7 and Whitney.
	8 But such 
an ordeal appears in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	9 and an ordeal 
with a glowing axe
	10 occurs in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad as 
applied in an accusation of theft. Geldner
	11 suggests that this 
usage is referred to even in the Rigveda,
	12 but this is most 
improbable.
	13 Ludwig
	14 and Griffith
	15 discover in another 
passage of the Rigveda
	16 references to Dīrghatamas' having 
been subjected to the fire and water ordeals, but this view 
cannot be supported. According to Weber,
	17 the ‘balance’ 
ordeal is referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	18 but see Tulā. 1) ii. 12. 2) Die Gottesurtheile der Indier, 13 et seq. 3) Indische Studien, 13, 168. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 445. 5) Altindisches Leben, 184. 6) Hundert Lieder,^2 45, 87. 7) Journal of the American Oriental

दिव्यश्वन्
दिव्य श्वन्,
 the ‘divine dog,’ in one passage of the Athar
vaveda
	1 appears to denote Canis major or Sirius. But Bloom
field
	2 thinks that the two divine dogs referred to in the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	3 and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	4 are the sun 
and moon, and that the sun is meant in the Atharvaveda. 1) vi. 80, 1. 2) Journal of the American Oriental

दिश्
दिश्,
 ‘direction,’ is a word very frequently used in the Rigveda 
and later
	1 to denote a quarter of the sky. As a general rule, 
four quarters are mentioned — east, south, west, north.
	2 But 
the number of the ‘directions’ is sometimes increased up to 
ten by the addition to these four of various others. The five 
points include the zenith (ūrdhvā);
	3 the six, the zenith and 
the nadir (ūrdhvā and avācī);
	4 the seven, the zenith, the 
ground on which one stands (dhruvā), and the air (antarikṣa) 
between these two (vyadhvā);
	5 the eight include the inter
mediate quarters (S.E., S.W., N.E., N.W.);
	6 the nine add to 
these the zenith;
	7 the ten, zenith and nadir.
	8 The number 
five is sometimes made up by the ground beneath the observer's 
feet (dhruvā),
	9 and the number six by that point (dhruvā) and 
the zenith (ūrdhvā);
	10 the ‘lofty’ (bṛhatī)
	11 sometimes taking 
the place of the ‘vertical’ (ūrdhvā). 1) Rv. i. 124, 3; 183, 5; iii. 30, 12;

दीर्घतमस्
दीर्घ-तमस्
 (‘long darkness’) Māmateya (‘son of Mamatā’) 
Aucathya (‘son of Ucatha’) is mentioned as a singer in one 
hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 and is referred to in several passages
	2 
by his metronymic, Māmateya, alone. He is said, both in the 
Rigveda
	1 and in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	3 to have attained 
the tenth decade of life. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	4 he 
appears as the priest of Bharata. The Bṛhaddevatā
	5 contains 
a preposterous legend made up of fragments of the Rigveda,
	6 
according to which Dīrghatamas was born blind, but recovered 
his sight; in old age he was thrown into a river by his servants, 
one of whom, Traitana, attacked him, but killed himself 
instead. Carried down by the stream, he was cast up in the 
Aṅga country, where he married Uśij, a slave girl, and begot 
Kakṣīvant. The two legends here combined are not even con
sistent, for the second ignores Dīrghatamas' recovery of sight. 
To attach any historical importance to them, as does Pargiter,
	7 
would seem to be unwise. 1) i. 158, 1. 6. 2) i. 147, 3; 152, 6; iv. 4, 13. In 
viii. 9, 10, Dīrghatamas is mentioned 
with Kakṣīvant, but not as a relative. 1) i. 158, 1. 6. 3) ii. 17; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaha, 
14. 4) viii. 23. 5) iv. 11-15; 21-25, with Macdonell's 
notes. 6) From i. 140-164, which hymns are 
traditionally attributed to Dīrghatamas.

दीर्घनीथ
दीर्घ-नीथ
 appears to be the proper name of a sacrificer 
in one hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 1) viii. 50, 10. Cf. Roth, St. Peters
burg Dictionary, s.v. Ludwig under
stands the word as an adjective, mean
ing ‘of long duration.’

दीर्घश्रवस्
दीर्घ-श्रवस्
 (‘far-famed’) is the name of a royal seer who, 
according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 having been banished 
from his kingdom, and suffering from actual hunger, ‘saw’ a 
certain Sāman (chant), and thus obtained food. In one passage 
of the Rigveda
	2 an Auśija,
	3 a merchant (vaṇij), is mentioned as 
dīrgha-śravas, which may be a proper name, as Sāyaṇa holds, 
or an adjective, as it is understood by Roth.
	4 1) xv. 3, 25. 2) i. 112, 11. 3) A metronymic, ‘descendant of 
Uśij,’ according to Sāyaṇa; but an 
adjective, meaning ‘desirous,’ accord
ing to Roth, St. Petersburg Dic
tionary, s.v. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 114.

दीर्घाप्सस्
दीर्घाप्सस्,
 used in the Rigveda
	1 as an epithet of a chariot, 
means, according to Roth,
	2 ‘having a long front part.’ 1) i. 122, 15. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 
312.

दीर्घायुत्व
दीर्घायुत्व,
 ‘longevity,’ is a constant object of the prayers 
of the Vedic Indians,
	1 and length of life is never deprecated in 
the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, while the Atharvaveda
	2 is full 
of spells intended to prolong existence (āyuṣyāṇi). 1) Rv. x. 62, 2; Av. i. 22, 2, etc.; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 6; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 1, 13, etc. So 
the adjective dīrghāyus, Rv. iv. 15, 9. 
10; x. 85, 39; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xii. 100, etc. The Brāhmaṇas regularly 
express the reward for ritual actions 
by the phrase sarvam āyur eti, ‘he lives 
all his days.’ The ideal of life is 100 
years. See Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 
193; Festgruss an Roth, 137; Lanman, 
Sanskrit Reader, 384. 2) ii. 13; 28; 29; vii. 32, and many 
other hymns. See Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 49 et seq.; Atharva- 
veda, 63-65.

दीर्घारण्य
दीर्घारण्य,
 ‘wide tract of forest,’ in the Aitareya
	1 and 
Śatapatha
	2 Brāhmanas refers to the extensive jungles which 
must clearly then have covered Northern India. In one of the 
Aitareya passages
	3 it is said that in the east the villages are 
close together and frequent, while in the west there are forests. 1) iii. 44; vi. 23. 2) xiii. 3, 7, 10. 3) iii. 44.

दीव्
दीव्
 (fem.) in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 denotes 
the ‘game of dice.’ See Akṣa. 1) x. 27, 17. 2) vii. 50, 9; 109, 5.

दुघा
दुघा,
 ‘yielding milk,’ denotes ‘cow’ in a few passages in 
the Saṃhitās.
	1 1) Rv. viii. 50, 3; x. 67, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxviii. 16, 39, etc.

दुन्दुभि
दुन्दुभि,
 apparently an onomatopoetic word, means ‘drum,’ 
as used in both war and peace. It is often mentioned from 
the Rigveda
	1 onwards.
	2 A special sort of drum was the ‘earth 
drum,’ made by digging a hole in the ground and covering it 
with a hide. This was employed in the Mahāvrata, a rite 
performed at the winter solstice, for the purpose of driving 
away influences hostile to the return of the sun.
	3 A ‘drum
beater’ is included in the list of sacrificial victims at the 
Puruṣamedha or ‘human sacrifice.’
	4 1) i. 28, 5; vi. 47, 29. 31. 2) Av. v. 20, 1 et seq.; 21, 7; 31, 7; 
vi. 38, 4; xii. 1, 41; Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa, i. 3, 6, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
v. 1, 5, 6; dundubhya, ‘connected with 
the drum,’ Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 
35. 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 5 (Indische

दुर्
दुर्
 is used several times in the Rigveda
	1 to denote ‘door,’ 
both literally and metaphorically. 1) i. 68, 10; 113, 4; 121, 4; 188, 5; ii. 2, 7, etc.

दुरोण
दुरोण
 is used in the Rigveda,
	1 and sometimes later,
	2 to 
denote ‘home,’ both literally and metaphorically. See Gṛha. 1) iii. 1, 18; 25, 5; iv. 13, 1; v. 76, 
4, etc. 2) Av. vii. 17, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxxiii. 71, etc.

दुर्ग
दुर्-ग,
 ‘hard to approach,’ occurs in the Rigveda as a 
neuter substantive only, sometimes in the sense of ‘fort,’ 
‘stronghold.’
	1 Cf. Pur. 1) v. 34, 7; vii. 25, 2.

दुर्गह
दुर्-गह
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
his grandsons are lauded for their generosity, though Sāyaṇa 
renders the word adjectivally.
	2 In another passage of the 
Rigveda,
	3 however, Sāyaṇa sees in the epithet Daurgaha a 
description of Purukutsa as Durgaha's son, who was either 
captured by the enemy or slain, and whose wife, Purukutsānī, 
then obtained a son, Trasadasyu, to restore the line; he also 
quotes a story, not found in the Bṛhaddevatā,
	4 to support this 
interpretation. On the other hand, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	5 
seems to take Daurgaha as meaning a horse. Sieg
	6 thinks 
that the same sense should be adopted in the Rigveda passage, 
which he interprets as referring to the sacrifice of a horse, 
Daurgaha, by King Purukutsa to gain a son; he also sees in 
Dadhikrāvan, with Pischel
	7 and Ludwig,
	8 a real horse, the 
charger of Trasadasyu. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa's inter
pretation of Daurgaha is, however, doubtful, and cannot be 
regarded as receiving support from the case of Dadhikrāvan, 
who was probably a divinity, and not a real horse at all.
	9 1) viii. 65, 12. 2) ‘Plunged in distress’ (duḥkhaṃ 
gāhamāna). 3) iv. 42, 8. 4) As Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v., says it is. 5) xiii. 5, 4, 5. According to the 
Naighaṇṭuka (i. 14), Daurgaha is a 
synonym of ‘horse.’ 6) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 96-102. 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 124. 8) Translation of the Rigveda, 4, 79.

Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 301, 302.

दुर्णामन्
दुर्-णामन्,
 ‘of evil name,’ is the designation in the Rigveda
	1 
and the Atharvaveda
	2 of a demon causing disease, or the 
disease itself. The Nirukta
	3 explains the words as meaning 
a ‘worm,’ an interpretation which accords with the wide
spread belief in disease-causing worms.
	4 Later Durnāman 
denotes ‘hæmorrhoids.’
	5 1) x. 162, 2. 2) ii. 25, 2; viii. 6, 1 et seq.; xvi. 6, 7; 
xix. 36, 1 et seq. So also the feminine 
Durṇāmnī, iv. 17, 5; xix. 36, 6. 3) vi. 12. 4) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 314 et seq., 351. 5) Suśruta, 1, 177, 10, etc.

दुर्मुख
दुर्-मुख,
 ‘ugly-faced,’ is the name, in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	1 of a Pāñcāla, that is, Pañcāla king, who conquered 
the world, and whose priest was Bṛhaduktha. 1) viii. 23. The reading may be a-rājā, ‘not a king,’ but this is not necessary.

दुर्य
दुर्य,
 ‘belonging to the door or house,’ appears in several 
passages of the Saṃhitās
	1 as a plural substantive denoting the 
‘door-posts,’ or more generally ‘dwelling.’ 1) Masculine plural, Rv. i. 91, 19; 
x. 40, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 3, 1; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 11; feminine 
plural, Rv. iv. 1, 9. 18; 2, 12; vii. 1, 11.

दुर्योण
दुर्योण
 occurs a few times in the Rigveda
	1 in the sense 
of ‘house.’ 1) i. 174, 7; v. 29, 10; 32, 8.

दुर्वराह
दुर्-वराह
 probably denotes a ‘wild boar.’ It is mentioned 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa.
	2 1) xii. 4, 1, 4. 2) i. 51, 4 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 23, 332).

दुला
दुला
 See Nakṣatra (Kṛttikās).

दुश्चर्मन्
दुश्-चर्मन्,
 ‘afflicted with a skin disease,’ occurs in the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 and Brāhmaṇa.
	2 The disease meant is 
probably leprosy, the usual name of which is Kilāsa.
	3 1) ii. 1, 4, 3; 5, 1, 7. 2) i. 7, 8, 3. 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 3, 17; 
xxiii. 16, 11; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 
v. 4, 12.

दुःशासु
दुः-शासु
 is possibly a proper name in the Rigveda,
	1 and 
would then denote an enemy of Kuruśravaṇa. Ludwig
	2 thinks 
that he was a Parśu or Persian, but this is most improbable, 
and the word may simply be an adjective meaning ‘malignant.’ 1) x. 33, 1. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165.

दुःशीम
दुः-शीम
 is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as a generous donor, 
his patronymic perhaps being Tānva.
	2 1) x. 93, 14. 2) x. 93, 15. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 166.

दुष्टरीतु
दुष्-टरीतु,
 ‘hard to defeat,’ is the name of a king of the 
Sṛñjayas, who was deposed from a principality that had 
existed for ten generations, but was re-instated by Cākra 
Sthapati in spite of the resistance of Balhika Prātipīya, 
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xii. 9, 3, 1 et seq. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 205-207.

दुःषन्त
दुः-षन्त
 See Dauḥṣanti.

दुहितृ
दुहितृ
 is the regular designation of ‘daughter’ from the 
Rigveda onwards.
	1 The word appears to be derived from 
duh, ‘milk,’ in the sense of one who nourishes a child, rather 
than as the ‘milker’ of the primitive family or the suckling.
	2 
See also Strī, Pati, Pitṛ, Bhrātṛ. 1) Rv. viii. 101, 15; x. 17, 1; 40, 5;

wandtschaftsnamen, 454.

दूत
दूत,
 ‘messenger’ or envoy,' is found several times in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 used metaphorically. The Sūta seems to 
have performed the duties later assigned to the Dūta. 1) iii. 3, 2; vi. 8, 4; vii. 3, 3; x. 14, 
12. 2) Av. viii. 8, 10, etc.; Satapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 1, 6; Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad, ii. 1, etc. The feminine 
form Dūtī is found in Rv. x. 108, 2, 3, 
in the story of Saramā's mission to the 
Paṇis. Dūtya, ‘mission,’ occurs in 
Rv. 1, 12, 4; 161, 1; iv. 7, 8; 8, 4, 
etc.

दूर्वा
दूर्वा,
 a species of grass (Panicum dactylon), is mentioned 
frequently from the Rigveda
	1 onwards.
	2 It grew in damp 
ground.
	3 A simile occurring in the Rigveda
	4 seems to indicate 
that the ears lay horizontal with the stem. Cf. Pākadūrvā. 1) x. 16, 13; 134, 5; 142, 8. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 9, 2;

दूर्श
दूर्श,
 denoting some kind of garment, is mentioned twice 
in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Weber
	2 thinks that it was worn by the 
aborigines. 1) iv. 7, 6; viii. 6, 11. 2) Indische Studien, 18, 29.

दूषीका
दूषीका,
 ‘rheum of the eyes,’ is mentioned as a disease in 
the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) xvi. 6, 8. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 12; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 9; Śatapatha

दृढच्युतागस्ति
दृढ-च्युत् आगस्ति
 (‘descendant of Agastya’) is mentioned 
in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having been Udgātṛ priest at 
the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the Vibhindukīyas. 1) iii. 233 (Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 18, 38). He is given 
in the Anukramaṇī (where the form 
of the patronymic is Āgastya) as the 
author of Rv. ix. 25. Cf. Indische 
Studien, 3, 219.

दृढजयन्त

दृति
1. Dṛti, a ‘leather bag to hold fluids,’ is frequently mentioned 
in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 In one passage
	3 it is called dhmāta, 
‘inflated,’ the man afflicted with dropsy being compared with 
such a bag. Milk (Kṣīra) and intoxicating liquor (Surā) are 
mentioned as kept in bags.

दृतिऐन्द्रोत
2. Dṛti Aindrota (‘descendant of Indrota’) is mentioned in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā
	1 as a contemporary of Abhipratārin 
Kākṣaseni and as a pupil of Indrota Daivāpa in a Vaṃśa (list 
of teachers) in the Jaīminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	2 Possibly 
the same Dṛti is meant in the compound Dṛti-Vātavantau, 
which is found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	3 The former is 
here said to have continued, after the Mahāvrata was over, the 
sacrificial session in which both had been engaged, with the 
result that his descendants prospered more than the Vātavatas. 1) xiv. 1, 12. 15. 2) iii. 40, 2. 3) xxv. 3, 6. So a Sattra of a year's 
duration is later called Dṛti-vātavator

दृप्तबालाकिगार्ग्य
दृप्त-बालाकि गार्ग्य
 (‘descendant of Garga’) is the name of 
a teacher who is mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 
(ii. 1, 1) as a contemporary of Ajātaśatru of Kāśi.

दृभीक
दृभीक
 is the name of a man
	1 or a demon,
	2 who, according 
to the Rigveda,
	3 was slain by Indra. 1) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 152, 207, who compares the

दृशान भार्गव
 (‘descendant of Bhṛgu’) is mentioned as 
a seer in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	1 1) xvi. 8. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 459.

दृषद्
दृषद्
 appears in the Rigveda
	1 and Atharvaveda
	2 to denote 
not a millstone,
	3 but merely a stone used to pound grain, which 
was placed on another stone as a support. When used later
	4 
in connexion with Upalā, the lower and the upper millstone, or 
mortar and pestle may be meant; but this is not certain. 
Eggeling
	5 renders them as the large and small millstones. See 
also Upara and Upalā. 1) vii. 104, 22; viii. 72, 4. 2) ii. 31, 1; v. 23, 8. 3) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary,

दृषद्वती
दृषद्वती,
 ‘stony,’ is the name of a river which flows into 
the Sarasvatī after running for a time parallel to it. It is 
mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 along with the Sarasvatī and the 
Āpayā, as the scene of action of the Bharata princes. In the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 and later
	3 the Dṛṣadvatī and the 
Sarasvatī are the scene of special sacrifices. In Manu
	4 these 
two rivers form the western boundary of the Middle Country. 1) iii. 23, 4. 2) xxv. 10, 13. 3) Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 6,

दृष्ट
दृष्ट
 See Adṛṣṭa.

देवकमान्यमान
देवक मान्यमान
 (‘descendant of Manyamāna’) appears 
in the Rigveda
	1 as an opponent of the Tṛtsus, and as connected 
with Śambara. Possibly, however, as Grassmann suggests, 
the words should be understood as denoting Śambara, ‘who 
deemed himself a god,’ devaka being used contemptuously.

देवकीपुत्र
देवकी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Devakī,’ is the metronymic of Kṛṣṇa 
in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	1 According to the Epic,
	2 a 
Devaka was father of Devakī, Kṛṣṇa's mother; the St. Peters
burg Dictionary suggests that he was the ‘king of the Gandh
arvas’, also referred to in the Epic.

sciences enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad.

देवतरस्श्यावसायनकाश्यप
देव-तरस् श्यावसायन काश्यप
 (‘descendant of Kaśyapa’) 
is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a pupil 
of Rsyasṛṅga. In the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	2 as Śāvasāyana, he is 
a pupil of his father Śavas, who again was a pupil of Kāśyapa. 1) iii. 40, 2. 2) Indische Studien, 4, 373.

देवत्या
देवत्या
 occurs in the text of the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it 
must, if the reading is correct, denote some animal.
	2 But the 
reading should no doubt be rohiṇī-devatyās, ‘having the red one 
as deity.’
	3 1) i. 22, 3. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 23.

देवन
देवन
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda
	1 in connexion with 
dicing. The word must designate the place on which the dice 
are thrown (elsewhere called Adhidevana), and it is so explained 
by Durga in his commentary on the Nirukta.
	2 1) x. 43, 5. 2) v. 22. 
Cf. Lüders, Das Würfelspiel im alten 
Indien, 14.

देवनक्षत्र
देव-नक्षत्र,
 ‘asterism of the gods,’ is the name applied 
in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 to the first fourteen lunar mansions, 
which are said to be south, while the others are called Yama
nakṣatra, ‘asterisms of Yama,’ and are said to be north. See 
Nakṣatra. 1) i. 5, 2, 6, 7. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 309, 310.

देवभागश्रौतर्ष
देव-भाग श्रौतर्ष
 is mentioned in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the Purohita, or ‘domestic priest,’ of both the 
Sṛñjayas and the Kurus. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	2 he is 
said to have taught Girija Bābhravya the science of the 
dissection of the sacrificial animal (pasor vibhakti). In the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	3 he is an authority on the Sāvitra Agni. 1) ii. 4, 4, 5. This passage is mis
quoted by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 81, 3. See 
Weber, Indische Studien, 2, 9. n.; 
Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152. 2) vii. x. 3) iii. 10, 9, 11.

देवमलिम्लुच्
देव-मलिम्लुच्,
 ‘robber of the gods,’ is the epithet of 
Rahasya,
	1 who is said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 to have 
slain the pious Vaikhānasas at Munimaraṇa (‘saint's death’). 
He was apparently an Asura, but may have been a real person. 1) Or Rahasyu. 2) xiv. 4, 7. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions 
of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 51, 52.

देवमुनि
देव-मुनि,
 ‘divine saint,’ is the epithet of Tura in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 14, 5). The name is given in the 
Anukramaṇī to the author of a hymn of the Rigveda (x. 146).

देवराजन्
देव-राजन्
 apparently denotes a king of Brahminical descent 
in the phrase ‘Sāmans of Devarājans’ in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa (xviii. 10, 5). Cf. Rājanyarṣi and Varṇa.

देवरात
देव-रात
 (‘god-given’) Vaiśvāmitra (‘descendant of Viśvā- 
mitra’) is the name given to Śunaḥśepa after his adoption by 
Viśvāmitra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) vii. 17. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 27.

देवल
 is mentioned as a Ṛṣi in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 
(xxii. 11). See also Daivala.

देववत्|देववन्त्
देववन्त्
 is mentioned in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in 
the Rigveda
	1 as the ancestor of Sudās, apparently his grand
father; or if Pijavana be accepted as Sudās' father, and 
Divodāsa as his grandfather, then his great-great-grandfather, 
and father of Vadhryaśva. The succession in the latter case 
would then be Devavant, Vadhryaśva, Divodāsa, Pijavana, 
Sudās. 1) vii. 18, 22. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 171; Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 2, 138.

देववात
देव-वात
 (‘desired of the gods’) is the name of a Bharata 
prince in the Rigveda,
	1 where he is mentioned as sacrificing on 
the Dṛṣadvatī, Sarasvatī, and Āpayā. 1) iii. 23, 2. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 409; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 218.

देवविद्या
देव-विद्या,
 ‘knowledge of the gods,’ is one of the sciences 
enumerated in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1).

देवश्रवस्
देव-श्रवस्
 is the name of a Bharata prince who with 
Devavāta appears as a sacrificer on the Dṛṣadvatī, Sarasvatī, 
and Āpayā in the Rigveda.
	1 1) iii. 23, 2. 3. In the Anukramaṇī he is called a son of Yama, and has a 
hymn, x. 17, ascribed to him.

देवातिथिकाण्व
देवातिथि काण्व
 (‘descendant of Kaṇva’) is mentioned in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the seer of a Sāman (chant) by 
which he turned pumpkins into cows for himself and his son 
when they were starving in the desert, whither they had been 
driven by rivals. He is also the reputed author of a hymn 
of the Rigveda.

necticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15,

देवापिआर्ष्टिषेण
देवापि आर्ष्टिषेण
 (‘descendant of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa’) is mentioned 
in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 and in the Nirukta.
	2 According to 
the latter source there were two brothers, Devāpi and Śantanu, 
princes of the Kurus. The elder was Devāpi, but Śantanu got 
himself anointed king, whereupon no rain fell for twelve years. 
The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having 
superseded his elder brother, Śantanu offered the kingdom to 
Devāpi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as Purohita, 
or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Bṛhad
devatā
	3 tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for 
Devāpi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered 
from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further 
develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts. 
According to the one version,
	4 the ground of Devāpi's being 
passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting 
himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's 
taking his place. The Epic,
	5 moreover, treats him as a son of 
Pratīpa, and names as his brothers Bāhlīka
	6 and Āṛṣṭiṣeṇa,
	7 
who is a new figure developed from the patronymic of Devāpi 
Possibly Sieg
	8 is right in holding that two stories, those of 
Devāpi, Pratīpa's son, and of Devāpi, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa's son, have been 
confused; but in any case it is impossible to extract history 
from them.
	9 
The Rigvedic hymn certainly appears to represent Devāpi 
as sacrificing for Śantanu, who seems to be called Aulāna.
	10 
But there is no trace in it of the brotherhood of the two men, 
nor is there anything to show that Devāpi was not a Brahmin, 
but a Kṣatriya. Sieg,
	11 who interprets the hymn by the 
Nirukta, thinks that he was a Kṣatriya, but on this occasion 
was enabled by the favour of Bṛhaspati to officiate as priest, 
and that the hymn shows clear recognition of the unusual 
character of his action; but this view seems very improbable. 1) x. 98. 2) ii. 10. 3) vii. 148 et seq., with Macdonell's 
notes. 4) Mahābhārata, v. 5054 et seq. (= 149,

the Agni, cclxxvii. 34, the Brahma, 
xiii. 114, 118, and the Viṣṇu Purāṇas) 
the form of the name; Matsya Purāṇa,

Bhāgavata, ix. 22, 12, 13, and the 
Vāyu Purāṇa, xcix. 234, 237, the form 
is Śantanu. 5) Mahābhārata, i. 3751 (= 94, 62);

देवृ
देवृ
 is a rare word denoting the wife's ‘brother-in-law’ 
(that is, the husband's brother). He is included with the 
sisters of the husband among those over whom the wife of the 
husband — his elder brother — rules;
	1 at the same time the wife 
is to be devoted to him,
	2 and friendly to him.
	3 After the death 
of the husband the Devṛ could perform the duty of begetting 
a son for him.
	4 No word occurs for the wife's brother 
corresponding to Devṛ. 1) Rv. x. 85, 46. Cf. Pati. 2) Rv. x. 85, 44. 3) Av. xiv. 2, 18. Cf. xiv. 1, 39. 4) Rv. x. 40, 2. Cf. x. 18, 8; Kaegi,

देश
देश,
 ‘land,’ is a word that does not come into use till the 
time of the Upaniṣads and Sūtras,
	1 excepting one occurrence 
in the latest period of the Brāhmaṇa
	2 literature, and one in 
a much-discussed passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	3 where 
the Sarasvatī is mentioned as having five tributaries. This 
passage militates against the view that Sarasvatī was a name 
of the Indus, because the use of Deśa here seems to indicate
	4 
that the seer of the verse placed the Sarasvatī in the Madhya
deśa or ‘Middle Country,’ to which all the geographical data 
of the Yajurvedas point.
	5 1) Where its use becomes common; 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 16; 
2, 3; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 14, 
6; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xv. 4, 17, 
etc. So the adjective deśīya, ‘belong
ing to a land,’ Kātyāyana, xxii. 4, 22; 
Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 6, 28. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 10 (a late 
passage). 3) xxxiv. 11. 4) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 10, 
who thinks that the word crept into 
the text, where the Sarasvatī originally 
meant the Indus, with the five tribu
taries of the Panjab. 5) Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 
174.

देही
देही
 in two passages of the Rigveda
	1 refers to defences 
thrown up against an enemy, apparently earthworks or dikes. 
Cf. Pur. 1) vi. 47, 2; vii. 6, 5. Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 344; Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 143.

दैधिषव्य
दैधिषव्य
 is mentioned in a Mantra of the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā.
	1 Apparently the word (as derived from Didhiṣū) 
denotes the son of a younger sister married before the elder 
sister,
	2 rather than the son of a woman twice married, the 
explanation of the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 1) iii. 2, 4, 4; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra,

दैयांपाति
दैयांपाति,
 ‘descendant of Dayāṃpāta,’ is the name of a 
teacher of the east, who was instructed by Śāṇḍilyāyana, 
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 5, 1, 14), in the lore 
of the construction of the fire-altar. The same patronymic is 
given, in the form of Dayyāṃpāti, to Plakṣa, the contemporary 
of Atyaṃhas in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 10, 9, 3-5).

दैव
1. Daiva (masc.) appears in the list of sciences in the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	1 where Śaṅkara explains it as utpāta- 
jñāna, apparently the ‘knowledge of portents.’ The St. Peters
burg Dictionary suggests that the word is here used adjectivally, 
and this view is followed by Little
	2 and by Böhtlingk in his 
translation.

Upaniṣad.

दैवल
दैवल,
 ‘descendant of Devala,’ is the patronymic of Asita 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 11, 18).

दैववात
दैव-वात,
 ‘descendant of Devavāta,’ is the patronymic of 
Sṛñjaya, probably the Sṛñjaya king, in the Rigveda. He is 
mentioned
	1 as a devotee of the fire cult, and as victorious over 
the Turvaśa king and the Vṛcīvants.
	2 According to Zimmer,
	3 
his name was Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna Pārthava (‘descendant 
of Pṛthu’), but Hillebrandt
	4 recognizes this as doubtful, though 
he none the less places the Sṛñjayas to the west of the Indus 
with Divodāsa. What is more important is to note that the 
name suggests connexion with the Bharata Devavāta, and as 
Kurus and Sṛñjayas were closely connected
	5 this is not 
immaterial. 1) Rv. iv. 15, 4. 2) Rv. vi. 27, 7. 3) Altindisches Leben, 133, 134. 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105, 106. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 5.

 ‘descendant of Devāpi,’ is the patronymic of 
Indrota in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa

 ‘descendant of Divodāsa,’ is the patronymic of 
Pratardana in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa

Upaniṣad.
	2 It is impossible to ascertain whether the famous 
Divodāsa is meant. 1) xxvi. 5. 2) iii. 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 214.

दोषा
दोषा,
 ‘evening,’ is frequently referred to from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards,
	2 usually as contrasted with uṣas, ‘dawn.’ In the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	3 the word is contrasted with prātar, 
‘early.’ See also Ahan. 1) i. 34, 3; 179, 1; ii. 8, 3; iv. 2, 8;

दोह,
 ‘milking,’ is a common word in the Atharvaveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 Reference is made in the Sūtras
	3 to the sāyaṃ-doha, 
‘evening milking,’ and the prātar-doha, ‘morning milking.’ 
Dohana has the same sense.

द्युतानमारुत
द्युतान मारुत
 (‘descendant of the Maruts’) is the name 
of a divine being invoked in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 and 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	2 and also mentioned in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā.
	3 In the Śatapatha
	4 Brāhmaṇa the name is explained 
to mean Vāyu, while in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	5 he seems 
to be regarded as the author of a Sāman (chant). He is 
treated as a Ṛṣi by the Anukramaṇī, which credits him with 
the authorship of a hymn of the Rigveda (viii. 96). 1) v. 27. 2) v. 5, 9, 4. Cf. vi. 2, 10, 4. 3) xv. 7. 4) iii. 6, 1, 16. 5) xvii. 1, 7. Cf. vi. 4, 2. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 
3, 311; Indische Studien, 3, 220.

द्युम्न
द्युम्न,
 according to Pischel,
	1 denotes ‘raft’ in one 
passage of the Rigveda.
	2 1) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 720 et seq. 2) viii. 19, 14.

द्यूत
द्यूत,
 ‘dicing,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the 
Sūtras.
	2 See Akṣa. 1) xii. 3, 46. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 6, 2; 
Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 10, 23, 
etc.

द्योतन
द्योतन
 is, according to Sāyaṇa, the name of a prince in 
the Rigveda.
	1 This is probably correct, though the word may 
also
	2 be interpreted as denoting ‘glorification’ but it is not 
clear what relation existed between Dyotana and the other 
persons mentioned in the same passage, Vetasu, Daśoṇi, 
Tūtuji, and Tugra. 1) vi. 20, 8. 2) As by Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 
1, 380. 
Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 55, 328.

द्रप्स
द्रप्स
 is a common word from the Rigveda onwards
	1 for 
a ‘drop’: according to Sāyaṇa,
	2 a ‘thick drop’ as opposed to 
stoka, a ‘small drop.’ Hence there frequently occurs the ex
pression dadḥi-drapsa,’ ‘drop of curds.’
	3 In the Rigveda
	4 the word 
normally denotes the thick drops of Soma or the Soma itself. 
In two passages
	5 Roth
	6 sees the sense of ‘banner,’ which is 
adopted by Oldenberg.
	7 Geldner,
	8 on the other hand, con
siders that ‘dust’ is meant, but this interpretation is not very 
probable. Max Müller
	9 renders the word ‘rain-drop’ in one 
of the passages. 1) Rv. i. 94, 11 (perhaps a ‘drop’ of 
fire); v. 63, 4 (‘rain-drop’); vii. 33, 
11 (= retas); Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 
2, 6; drapsin (‘thick-flowing’), xi. 4, 
1, 15. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 1, p. 70, 7. 
Cf. the epithet uru-drapsa, Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 10, 2; Sāyaṇa, on 
Av. xviii. 4, 18, takes drapsa to mean 
‘drops of curd’; so Agnisvāmin on 
Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 2, 4. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 3, 
40. 4) ix. 78, 4; 85, 10; 89, 2; 97, 56; 
108, 8; x. 11, 4; 17, 11. 12. Cf. Tait
tirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 3, 9. 1. 5) iv. 13, 2, and drapsin in i. 64, 2. 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
satvan; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. 
drapsa, drapsin. 7) Sacred Books of the East, 46, 357:

with reference to Rv. i. 64, 2. 
Cf. Macdonell, op. cit., pp. 105, 113.

द्रापि
द्रापि
 occurs several times in the Rigveda
	1 in the sense of 
‘mantle’ or ‘cloak.’
	2 Sāyaṇa, however, renders the word by 
‘coat of mail’
	3 (kavaca). This seems needless, but none of the 
passages are very decisive one way or the other. 1) i. 25, 13; 116, 10; iv. 33, 2; ix. 86, 
14; 100, 9; Av. iii. 13, 1. 2) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary,

Literature, 536; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 
2, 201, 202.

द्रु
द्रु
 denotes a vessel made of wood,
	1 and in particular the 
vessel used at the Soma sacrifice,
	2 perhaps, as Hillebrandt
	3 sug
gests, to catch the Soma juice when running through the sieve. 
In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	4 the word simply means ‘wood.’ 1) Rv. i. 161, 1; v. 86, 3; viii. 66, 
11; in x. 101, 10, the mortar seems 
meant. In v. 86, 3, Böhtlingk takes it 
to denote a ‘wooden handle.’ 2) ix. 1, 2; 65, 6; 98, 2. 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 191, 192. 4) i. 3, 9, 1. So often in compounds, 
e.g., Rv. ii. 7, 6; vi. 12, 4, etc.

द्रुघण
द्रु-घण
 is found in the Mudgala hymn of the Rigveda
	1 
and in the Atharvaveda.
	2 The sense is uncertain. Yāska
	3 
renders it as a ‘ghana made of wood,’ probably, as Roth
	4 takes 
it, meaning a ‘club of wood.’ Geldner
	5 thinks that it was a 
wooden bull used by Mudgala as a substitute for a second bull 
when he wanted to join in a race. But this interpretation of 
the legend is very improbable.
	6 Whitney
	7 translates the word 
as ‘tree-smiter’ in the Atharvaveda, quoting Sāyaṇa, who 
explains it as a ‘cutting instrument,’ so called because trees are 
struck with it. 1) x. 101, 9. 2) vii. 28, 1. 3) Nirukta, ix. 23. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 3, 4. 6) Cf. von Bradke, Zeitschrift der

407.

द्रुपद
द्रु-पद,
 a ‘wooden pillar’ or ‘post,’ is several times 
referred to in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 Śunaḥśepa was bound 
to three posts for sacrifice.
	3 Thieves, there is some evidence to 
show, were tied to posts as a penalty for stealing.
	4 1) i. 24, 13; iv. 32, 23. 2) Av. vi. 63, 3; 115, 2; xix. 47, 9; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 20. 3) Rv. i. 24, 13. 4) Av. xix. 47, 9; 50, 1. Cf. vi. 63, 3 
= 84, 4. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
181, 182, and Taskara. n. 26.

द्रुम
द्रुम,
 ‘tree,’ is not found until the later period in the 
Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (v. 11) and the Nirukta (iv. 19; v. 26; ix. 23).

द्रुवय
द्रुवय,
 ‘wooden,’ is used in the Atharvaveda
	1 as an 
epithet of the drum. 1) v. 20, 2. Cf. xi. 1, 12, where it is 
an epithet of upaśvasa, ‘blower,’ pos
sibly ‘bellows’; but the manuscripts 
in part read dhruvaye, and the Paip
palāda has druye.

द्रुहन्
द्रु-हन्,
 ‘wood-cutter,’ seems to be meant by the word 
druhantara in the Rigveda,
	1 where it is usually taken as druhaṃ- 
tara, ‘fiend-overpowering.’ But as an epithet of paraśu, ‘axe,’ 
the other sense (‘mighty wood-cutter’)
	2 is more probable.
	3 1) i. 127, 2. 2) But if this explanation is correct, 
the word should have the accentuation 
of the comparative. See Oldenberg, 
Sacred Books of the East, 46, 132. 3) Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 130.

द्रुह्यु
द्रुह्यु
 is the name of a people mentioned several times in 
the Rigveda. In one passage
	1 it occurs, in the plural, with the 
Yadus, Turvaśas, Anus, and Pūrus, suggesting that these are 
the famous five peoples of the Rigveda.
	2 Again, the Druhyu 
king shared in the defeat of his allies by Sudās, and appears to 
have perished in the waters.
	3 In a second passage Druhyu, 
Anu, Turvaśa, and Yadu are all mentioned in the singular,
	4 
while in another Pūru and Druhyu occur.
	5 From the tribal 
grouping it is probable that the Druhyus were a north-western 
people,
	6 and the later tradition of the Epic connects Gāndhāra 
and Druhyu.

द्रोण
द्रोण
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 a ‘wooden trough,’ and more 
specifically it designates in the plural vessels used for holding 
Soma.
	2 The great wooden reservoir for Soma is called a 
Droṇa-kalaśa.
	3 The altar was sometimes made in the form of 
a Droṇa.

द्रोणाहाव
द्रोणाहाव
 is used as an epithet of Avata, ‘well,’ in the 
Rigveda,
	1 apparently in the sense of ‘having wooden buckets’ 
with reference to the drawing up of water. 1) x. 101, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 157.

द्वादश
द्वादश,
 ‘consisting of twelve,’
	1 is used of the year in the 
Rigveda (vii. 103, 9). See Nakṣatra. 1) Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 645 et seq.

द्वापर
द्वापर
 See Akṣa and Yuga.

द्वार्
द्वार्
 is frequently used from the Rigveda
	1 onwards
	2 to 
denote the ‘door’ of a house. The later form, Dvāra, has the 
same sense.
	3 Cf. Gṛha. The ‘door-fastener’ is called Dvāra
pidhāna in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	4 1) i. 13, 6. 2) Av. viii. 3, 22; xiv. 1, 63; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2; xiv. 3, 1, 13, 
etc. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 1, 19; 
iv. 3, 5, 9; 6, 7, 9; xi. 4, 4, 2, etc. 
Av. x. 8, 43, has nava-dvāra, ‘having 
nine openings,’ of the body. 4) xi. 1, 1, 1. Cf. dvāra-bāhū, ‘door
posts,’ in Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
i. 3, 1; ii. 3, 9.

द्वारप
द्वार-प,
 ‘door-keeper,’ is only found in a metaphorical 
sense in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (i. 30), where Viṣṇu is called 
the ‘doorkeeper’ of the gods, and in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 
(iii. 13, 6).

द्विगत्भार्गव
द्वि-गत् भार्गव
 (‘descendant of Bhṛgu’) is mentioned in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 9) as the seer of a Sāman or 
Chant, by means of which he twice went to the heavenly world.

द्विज
द्वि-ज,
 ‘twice-born,’ as an epithet of the Āryans generally, 
or of the Brahmins in particular, is not found in Vedic litera
ture except in a quite obscure verse of the Atharvaveda.
	1 1) xix. 71, 1. Cf. Whitney, Transla
tion of the Atharvaveda, 1008; Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 204. Neither dvi- 
janman nor dvi-jāti occurs early, and 
the idea is not in this form an early 
one.

द्विपाद्
द्वि-पाद्,
 ‘two-footed,’ ‘biped,’ denotes man, as opposed to 
quadrupeds, from the Rigveda
	1 onwards.
	2 1) i. 49, 3; iii. 62, 14; viii. 27, 12; 
x. 97, 20; 117, 8. 2) Av. ii. 34, 1; x. 1, 24; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, viii. 30; ix. 31; xiii. 17; 
xiv. 8, etc.

द्विबन्धु
द्वि-बन्धु
 is in an obscure hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 according 
to Roth
	2 and Grassmann,
	3 the name of a man, while Ludwig
	4 
renders it as a simple adjective meaning ‘of double kinship.’ 1) x. 61, 17. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary. 3) Wörterbuch, s.v., and Translation of 
the Rigveda, 2, 475. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 643, and 5, 526.

द्विराज
द्वि-राज
 (neut,), ‘conflict between two kings,’ or ‘battle,’ is 
mentioned in the Atharvaveda (v. 20, 9). Cf. Dāśarājña.

द्विरेतस्
द्वि-रेतस्,
 ‘having double seed,’ is an epithet of both the 
ass
	1 and the mare.
	2 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 9; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 1, 23. Cf. Gardabha. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 4.

द्वीप
द्वीप,
 ‘island,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 But 
there is no reason to imagine that the islands referred to were 
other than sandbanks in the great rivers, Indus or Ganges.
	3 
Vedic literature knows nothing of the system of geography 
according to which the earth consists of four, seven, or thirteen 
Dvīpas grouped round Mount Meru. 1) i. 169, 3. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 2; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 1, 3; Lāṭyā
yana Śrauta Sütra, i. 6, 10. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 256.

द्वीपिन्
द्वीपिन्,
 
	1 ‘panther’ or ‘leopard,’ is mentioned in the Athar
vaveda
	2 and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.
	3 1) Lit., ‘insulated’ — i.e., ‘spotted.’ 2) iv. 8, 7; vi. 38, 2; xix. 49, 4, in 
every case associated with the tiger. 3) ii. 1. 9. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 80.

द्वैतवन
द्वैत-वन,
 ‘descendant of Dvitavana,’ is the patronymic 
of Dhvasan, the king of the Matsyas, whose Aśvamedha, or 
‘horse sacrifice,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
(xiii. 5, 4, 9).

द्व्योपश
द्व्य्-ओपश
 See Opaśa.

धन
धन,
 ‘prize,’ is often found in the Rigveda,
	1 probably the 
prize in racing rather than the ‘booty’ in battle. It also 
denotes
	2 the ‘stake’ at dicing. In some passages it possibly 
means the ‘contest’ itself.
	3 More generally it denotes ‘wealth’ 
or ‘gift.’
	4 But it sometimes expresses ‘booty,’
	5 probably from 
the notion of ‘wealth’ rather than of ‘prize.’ 1) Rv. i. 81, 3; vi. 45, 2; viii. 80, 8; 
ix. 53, 2; 109, 10. Cf. Geldner, Ve- 
dische Studien, 1, 120; Pischel, ibid., 1, 
171. 2) Rv. x. 34, 10; Av. iv. 38, 3. 3) Rv. i. 31, 6; v. 35, 7; vii. 38, 8;

धनधानी
धन-धानी,
 a ‘treasure house,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka (x. 67).

धनिष्ठा
धनिष्ठा
 (‘very rich’), used in the plural, is the later name
	1 
of the lunar mansion (Nakṣatra) Śraviṣṭhā. 1) Sāntikalpa, 13; Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 26.

धनु
धनु
 (fem.), ‘sandbank,’ occurs several times in the Rig
veda,
	1 but only metaphorically of the clouds in the atmosphere. 
Dhanū is found in the Atharvaveda,
	2 where it seems to denote 
a sandbag used to prevent bleeding.
	3 Cf. Dhanvan. 1) i. 33, 4; 144, 5; viii. 3, 19; x. 4, 3; 
27, 17. 2) i. 17, 4. 3) Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 411; 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 18; Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 259, 260.

धनुस्
धनुस्,
 the ‘bow,’ frequently mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and later,
	2 was the chief weapon of the Vedic Indian.
	3 The 
last act of the funeral rite included the removal of the bow from 
the right hand of the dead man.
	4 The weapon was composed 
of a stout staff bent into a curved shape (vakra),
	5 and of a bow
string (Jyā) made of a strip of cowhide
	6 which joined the ends. 
The tips of the bow, when the string was fastened, were called 
Ārtnī. Relaxed when not in actual use, the bow was specially 
strung up when needed for shooting.
	7 The stages of the 
process are given in detail in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā:
	8 the 
stringing (ā-tan) of the bow, the placing (prati-dhā) of the 
arrow, the bending (ā-yam) of the bow, and the shooting (as). 
The arrow was discharged from the ear,
	9 and is hence called 
karṇa-yoni,
	10 ‘having the ear as its point of origin.’
	10 The 
making of bows was a regular profession (dhanuṣ-kāra,
	11 
dhanuṣ-kṛt).
	12 For the arrow see Iṣu, and for the handguard 
Hastaghna. 1) viii. 72, 4; 77, 11; ix. 99, 1; x. 18, 
9; 125, 6. 2) Av. iv. 4, 6; 6, 6; v. 18, 8; vii. 50.

Brāhmaṇa, vii. 14; Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, i. 5, 4, 6; v. 3, 1, 11, etc. 3) Rv. vi. 75, 2. Practically no other 
weapon plays any substantial part in 
Vedic warfare. 4) Rv. x. 18, 9. 5) Av. iv. 6, 4. 6) Rv. vi. 75, 11; Av. i. 2, 3. 7) Rv. x. 166, 3; Av. vi. 42, 1. 8) xvi. 22. 9) Rv. vi. 75, 2 et seq. So also in the 
Epic, Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 271. The Homeric 
method is to draw to the breast — e.g., 
Iliad, iv. 123. 10) Rv. ii. 24, 8. 10) Rv. ii. 24, 8. 11) xxx. 7. 12) xvi. 46. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 298, 
299; Hopkins, op. cit., 13, 270 et seq. 
The Epic bow is about 5(1/2) feet, and the 
arrow 3 feet in length.

धन्वन्
1. Dhanvan, ‘bow,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 It also occurs in the compounds iṣu-dhanva, ‘bow and 
arrow,’
	3 ājya-dhanva,
	4 ‘having clarified butter for its bow,’
	5

धन्वन्
2. Dhanvan, ‘desert,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 Death from thirst in the desert was not rare,
	3 and 
the value of a spring in the desert was fully appreciated.
	4 
The great desert east of the Sindhu (Indus) and the 
Śutudrī (Sutlej) is possibly referred to in one hymn of the 
Rigveda.

धमनि
धमनि,
 ‘reed,’ appears to denote ‘pipe’ in a passage of 
the Rigveda
	1 and in a citation appearing in the Nirukta.
	2 In 
the Atharvaveda
	3 it denotes, perhaps, ‘artery’ or ‘vein,’ or 
more generally ‘intestinal channel,’ being coupled in some 
passages
	4 with Hirā. 1) ii. 11, 8. 2) vi. 24. 3) i. 17, 23; ii. 33, 6; vi. 90, 2;

धरुण
धरुण
 in one passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (viii. 51) 
denotes a ‘sucking calf.’

धर्म
धर्म,
 
	1 Dharman,
	2 are the regular words, the latter in the 
Rigveda,
	1 and both later,
	2 for ‘law’ or ‘custom.’ But there is 
very little evidence in the early literature as to the administra
tion of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand, 
the Dharma Sūtras
	3 contain full particulars. 
(1) Criminal Law. — The crimes recognized in Vedic litera
ture vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction 
adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are 
regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely 
conventional practices.
	4 The crimes enumerated include the 
slaying of an embryo (bhrūṇa),
	5 the slaying of a man (vīra),
	6 and 
 the slaying of a Brahmin,
	7 a much more serious crime. 
Treachery is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	8 as being 
punishable by death, as it was punished later.
	9 But there is no 
trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the 
king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the 
system of wergeld (Vaira), which indicates that criminal justice 
remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the 
Sūtras,
	10 on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as 
infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according 
to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there 
fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdic
tion steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa to the king as wielding punishment (Daṇḍa) confirm 
this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems 
suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he 
undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin 
caste, cannot be made out clearly.
	11 
The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain. 
In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	12 the ordeal of the red-hot axe is 
mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must 
apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction 
of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic 
literature (see Divya). The punishment of theft was in some 
cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken red
handed;
	13 in other cases binding to posts was the penalty,
	14 
presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In 
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	15 the list of sins given as apparently 
equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a 
Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin. 
(2) Civil Law. — There is little recorded as to civil law in 
Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question 
of family property are dealt with under Urvarā, Kṣetra, Pati; 
succession and partition of property are treated under Dāya. 
As regards the transfer of chattels — for land as transferable 
inter vivos is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a 
sacrificial fee (Dakṣiṇā), and then disapproved
	16 — the recognized 
modes are gift (Dāna) and barter or sale (Kraya), which includes 
exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought 
about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen,
	17 
while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them, 
provided that they were found on one's own land or on 
unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person 
originally. The Sūtras
	18 contain rules for the disposal of lost 
property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction 
of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin, 
who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to money
lending (for which see Ṛṇa), practically nothing is to be gathered 
from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive 
conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour, 
which would in a more developed society have been done by 
workers for hire, would be performed by slaves (cf. Dāsa, 
Śūdra), while the technical workers of the village — of whom 
long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	19 and the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	20 — may have been recompensed not by 
any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allow
ances, much as the village servants are in modern times.
	21 But 
this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain 
what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village. 
Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any 
legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for 
insults appear in the Sūtras.
	22 
Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list
	23 of victims 
at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a praśnin, 
an abhi-praśnin, and a praśna-vivāka, in whom it is not un
reasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator 
or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early 
form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same 
idea may be conveyed by the word madhyama-śī, ‘lying in the 
midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda,
	24 and which Roth,
	25 
followed by Zimmer,
	26 understood to mean an arbitrator or 
judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with 
other judicial persons,
	27 and being surrounded by the assembly 
of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney
	28 
thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom 
his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and 
may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction 
with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to 
conjecture.
	29 
The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see Jñātṛ), 
and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter 
except the dispute between Vatsa and his rival as to the true 
Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his 
walking unharmed through the flame of a fire.
	30 But it is 
probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for 
the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was 
so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that 
a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin.
	31 
There are very few references to police officials: no doubt 
the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences 
and arrest offenders (see Ugra, Jīvagṛbh). 
(3) Morality. — It is convenient to notice under this head 
several points bearing on the moral condition of the people: 
(a) the exposure of children; (b) the exposure of the aged; 
(c) prostitution; (d) adultery; (e) incest. 
(a) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer
	32 on 
the strength of a passage in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	33 but it 
seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood,
	34 and 
that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it, 
while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth 
of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in 
an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples.
	35 
(b) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer
	36 
from a passage of the Rigveda,
	37 and from the mention of 
persons exposed (ud-hitāḥ) in the Atharvaveda.
	38 The latter 
passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed 
after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The 
former passage merely refers to the individual case of some 
person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely 
nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a 
custom be inferred from, e.g., the legend of Cyavāna. 
(c) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain, 
but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently 
reduced to becoming prostitutes;
	39 the putting away of an 
illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda;
	40 besides the 
terms puṃścalī
	41 and mahānagnī,
	42 which undoubtedly mean 
‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution;
	43 and 
expressions like kumārī-putra, ‘son of a maiden,’
	44 and the 
‘son of an unmarried girl’ (agrū), spoken of in the Rigveda
	45 
as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same 
direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	46 seems to recognize 
prostitution as a profession. Pischel
	47 sees many references 
to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner
	48 insists reflects in 
its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correct
ness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by 
any means certain.
	49 
(d) Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples 
as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected. 
We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of 
the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken 
in the act.
	50 Weber,
	51 however, has adduced some material 
indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and 
Ludwig
	52 has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück
	53 has 
clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited pre
scriptions
	54 forbidding connexion with another man's wife 
during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would 
otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas,
	55 
when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have 
been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family 
by a wife's fall; Yājñavalkya's famous saying
	56 that no one 
cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ (paraḥ-puṃsā) or not is a 
mere mistranslation,
	57 the expression paraḥ-puṃsā really mean
ing ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty 
asserted in some passages
	58 as to origin from a Ṛṣi is not a 
sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood 
was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's 
position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such 
stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra
	59 are not compatible with 
a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is 
pointed to by references in the Yajurveda
	60 to relations between 
the Ārya man and the Śūdrā woman, and by a spell given in 
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	61 to expiate relations with the 
wife of a Śrotriya (Brahmin theologian). 
(e) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and 
sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the 
Rigveda,
	62 which clearly shows that such a marriage was not 
approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another 
hymn
	63 in which reference to such intercourse appears to be 
made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda
	64 to the 
wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however, 
interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas,
	65 an interpre
tation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually 
did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda;
	66 but even though 
the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justi
fied, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the 
normal occurrence of such relations. 1) i. 22, 18; 164, 43, 50; iii. 3, 1;

(see Delbrück. Die indogermanischen Ver-

are coupled with murder, though not 
equated with it. See also Chāndogya

list of sinners includes a drinker of

Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 12, 
where the death of a boy by careless 
driving is mentioned, and the king is 
reproached for it by his Purohita. 
They dispute as to the guilt, and, 
according to one version (see Sieg, Die 
Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 66, 67), the 
Ikṣvākus decide that the action was 
sinful, and required expiation. 7) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 2; 
v. 3, 12, 1; vi. 5, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xxxi. 7 (where the Kapiṣṭhala 
has brahma-jya, ‘oppressor of a Brah
min’); Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 8, 
12. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, x. 38, 
declares that the slaying of a Brahmin 
alone is truly murder, and the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 1 et seq., 
states that the sin of murdering a 
Brahmin can be expiated only by the 
performance of an Aśvamedha, or ‘horse 
sacrifice’ — the ne plus ultra of human 
generosity to Brahmins. See also 
Nirukta, vi. 27. The later tradition 
also interprets bhrūṇa as Brahmin (see 
Saṅkara, cited in Weber, Indische 
Studien, 1, 410, n.; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka, 30, n. 5; Konow, Sāma-

punished (han). 12) vi. 16. Cf. Weber, Indian Litera-

cludes slaying a Brahmin, defiling a 
Guru's bed, stealing a cow, drinking 
Surā, and killing an embryo, along with 
irregularities in offering a Śrāddha, 
‘water offering to the dead.’ Cf. also 
Nirukta, vi. 27, for a list of seven.

धवित्र,
 occurring in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the

patronymic of Aṃśu in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Under this 
patronymic he is frequently named by 
Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 1, 25; 
ii. 1, 2; 9, 10, etc. (misread Dhānaṃ
japya in many manuscripts). Cf. 
Weber, Indian Literature, 76, 77, 82.

धाना
धाना,
 always used in the plural, and frequently referred to 
in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 means ‘grains of corn.’ They were 
sometimes parched (bhṛjj),
	3 and were regularly mixed with 
Soma.

धान्य
धान्य
 (neut.), a derivative from the preceding word,
	1 
denotes ‘grain’ in general. It is found in the Rigveda
	2 and 
later.
	3 According to the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	4 there are 
ten cultivated (grāmyāṇi) kinds of grain: rice and barley (vrīhi- 
yavāḥ), sesamum and beans (tila-māṣāḥ), Panicum Miliaceum 
and Italicum (aṇu-priyaṅgavaḥ), maize (godhūmāḥ), lentils 
(masūrāḥ), Khalvāḥ and Dolichos uniflorus (khala-kulāḥ). The 
horse is called ‘corn-eating’ (dhānyāda) in the Aitareya
	5 and 
Śatapatha
	6 Brāhmaṇas, and men are mentioned as ‘purifying 
corn’ (dhānyā-kṛt) in the Rigveda.
	8 
7 Lit., ‘preparing corn.’ 1) Primarily as an adjective, ‘con
sisting of grain.’ 2) vi. 13, 4. 3) Av. iii. 24, 2. 4; v. 29, 7; vi. 50, 1;

धान्व
धान्व
 is the patronymic of Asita in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa.
	1 In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 the form of the 
name is Dhānvana. 1) xiii. 4, 3, 11; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 7. 2) xvi. 2, 20.

धामन्
धामन्
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 ‘dwelling’ and 
‘house,’ or sometimes
	3 its inmates. The word is also
	4 found 
in the sense of ‘ordinance,’ ‘law,’ expressing much the same 
as Dharman, especially in conjunction
	5 with Rta, ‘eternal 
order.’ Hillebrandt
	6 sees in one passage
	7 the sense of 
Nakṣatra. 1) i. 144, 1; ii. 3, 2; iii. 55, 10;

	2 or of a razor (kṣura).
	3 See also Asi. 1) Rv. vi. 3, 5; 47, 10. Cf. viii. 73, 9;

metaphorical applications. 2) Kauśika Sūtra, 44. 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iii. 3, 2.

धिषणा
धिषणा,
 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, denotes
	1 
an implement used in preparing the Soma, ‘bowl’ or ‘vat,’ 
and by metonymy also the Soma draught itself.
	2 The dual, by 
a metaphor,
	3 also expresses the ‘two worlds,’ heaven and earth.
	4 
Hillebrandt,
	5 however, thinks that the word properly means 
earth,
	6 in the dual heaven and earth,
	7 in the plural the triad, 
earth, atmosphere, and heaven,
	8 while in some passages
	9 
Dhiṣaṇā denotes the Vedi, the excavated ground used as an 
altar. This is not, however, certain, while it seems clear that 
the Vājasaneyi
	10 and Taittirīya
	11 Saṃhitās understand the 
Dhiṣaṇās (dual) to be the planks over which the pressing of 
the Soma took place (adhiṣavaṇa-phalake).
	12 Pischel
	13 sees in 
Dhiṣaṇā a goddess of wealth akin to Aditi and the earth. 1) Rv. i. 96, 1; 102, 1; 109, 3, 4;

धी
धी,
 ‘thought,’ is used several times in the Rigveda
	1 to 
denote the ‘prayer’ or ‘hymn of praise’ of the singer. One 
poet speaks of himself as ‘weaving’ such a prayer,
	2 while 
another refers to his ‘ancient ancestral hymn,’ which he 
refurbishes presumably for use.

Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 338.

धीति
धीति
 has in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 practically the 
same sense as Dhī, ‘prayer,’ or ‘hymn of praise.’ 1) i. 110, 1; iii. 12, 7; 52, 6; v. 25, 3; 53, 11; vi. 15, 9, etc.; Nirukta, ii. 24.

धीरशातपर्णेय
धीर शात-पर्णेय
 (‘descendant of Śataparṇa’) is men
tioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 3, 3, 1) as a pupil of 
Mahāśāla.

धीवन्
धीवन्
 occurs in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it may either be 
taken with Roth,
	2 Bloomfield,
	3 and Whitney
	4 as an epithet of 
‘chariot-builders’ (ratha-kārāḥ), meaning ‘clever,’ or be con
strued with the scholiast as denoting ‘fishermen’ (dhīvara). 
The Paippalāda recension has takṣāṇaḥ, ‘carpenters.’ 1) iii. 5, 6. 2) St. Petersbuig Dictionary, s.v. 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 114. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 114. 
Cf. Weber, Indīsche Studien, 17, 194 
et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252.

धुङ्क्षा
धुङ्क्षा
 is the name of some sort of bird in the list of 
victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās.
	1 See also Dhūṅkṣṇā and Dhvāṅkṣa. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 93.

धुनि
धुनि
 is the name of a foe of Indra, normally mentioned 
along with Cumuri in the Rigveda.
	1 He and Cumuri seem to 
have been opposed to Dabhīti.
	2 His name is probably that 
of an aboriginal chief.
	3 1) ii. 15, 9; vi. 18, 8; 20, 13; vii. 19, 4. 2) Rv. x. 113. 9. 3) Wackernagel, Altindische Grammatik, 
1, xxii; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 
p. 162. Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des 
Veda, 157, 158.

धुर्
धुर्
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes, according to the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, that part of the yoke which is 
placed on the shoulders of the animals drawing the chariot or 
cart, whence they are called dhūr-ṣāh, ‘yoke-bearing,’ in the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	3 In one passage of the Rigveda
	4 the 
sense is uncertain: Roth
	5 takes it to mean the pin at either 
end of the axle (Akṣa) which goes through the nave of the 
wheel, and would thus be equivalent to Āṇi, and Oldenberg
	6 
seems to adopt the same view. Monier Williams
	7 seems to 
think that ‘load’ is meant, but this is not probable. It is 
possible that Dhur has the sense of ‘pole,’
	8 and then more 
generally still the pole and the axle together regarded as the 
drawing part of the chariot: this might explain the use in the 
doubtful passage of the Rigveda. 1) i. 84, 16; 100, 16; 134, 3; 164, 19; 
ii. 18, 7; iii. 35, 2; v. 55. 6; vii. 34, 4, 
etc. 2) Av. v. 17, 18; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 
vi. 18; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2 
10; 4, 4, 13, etc.; Aitareya Āraṇyaka 
i. 5, 2 (the Dhur is the end), etc. 3) iv. 33. Cf. Uara. 4) v. 43. 8. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 2. 6) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 339; Griffith. 
Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 508. The akṣa- 
dhurau are mentioned in the Āpastamba 
Srauta Sūtra, xi. 6, 5; Kātyāyana 
Srauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 22. Cf. Caland 
and Henry. L'Agniṣṭoma, 31. 7) Dictionary, s.v. 8) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 246. 
Later, the word means the ‘end of the 
pole,’ a sense already found in the 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka (n. 2). This modi
fication of meaning seems to be due to 
the fact that the yoke is at the end of 
the pole. See also Dhūrṣad.

धूङ्क्ष्णा
धूङ्क्ष्णा
 is the form in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 of the 
name of the bird elsewhere found as Dhuṅkṣā. It is glossed 
as ‘white crow’ (śveta-kākī). 1) v. 5, 19, 1. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93, gives the form as Dhūṅkṣṇa. 
perhaps in error. Cf. also Dhvāṅkṣa.

धूमकेतु
धूम-केतु,
 ‘smoke-bannered,’ is an epithet of Mṛtyu, 
‘death,’ in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Zimmer
	2 thinks that a comet 
is meant, but Whitney
	3 considers this extremely improbable. 
Lanman
	4 plausibly suggests that the smoke of the funeral pile 
is referred to. 1) xix. 9, 10. 2) Altindisches Leben, 358. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 914. 4) Ibid.

धूम्र
धूम्र
 in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (i. 8, 21, 1) denotes 
‘camel’ according to Böhtlingk's Dictionary.

धूर्षद्
धूर्-षद्
 means, according to Roth,
	1 ‘standing under the 
yoke’ and so ‘burden-bearing,’ and thus metaphorically 
‘promoting,’ in the passages of the Rigveda
	2 where it occurs. 
More probable, however, is the view
	3 that it means ‘sitting on 
the pole,’ that is, ‘charioteer,’ with reference to the fact that 
to get near his horses the charioteer might well go forward 
and sit on the pole or even on the yoke.
	4 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) i. 143, 7; ii. 2, 1; 34, 4 (but cf. Pischel. 
Vedische Studien, 1, 301). In x. 132, 7, 
Roth renders ‘resting on the yoke.’ 3) Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 237 et seq.; Keith, 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 195. 4) Cf. Mahābhārata, viii. 617: dhuryān dhuryagatān sūtān.

धृतराष्ट्र
1. Dhṛta-rāṣṭra (‘having his kingdom firmly established’) is 
the name of a snake demon with the patronymic Airāvata, 
‘descendant of Irāvant,’ in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	2 1) viii. 10, 29. 2) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 26, 15; Weber, Indische 
Studien, 17. 257.

धृतराष्ट्रवैचित्रवीर्य
2. Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitra-vīrya (‘descendant of Vicitra
vīrya’) is mentioned in a passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	1 
which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no 
ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pañcāla king; he 
seems rather to have lived at some distance from the Kuru
Pañcālas. There is no good reason to deny his identity
	2 with 
the Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 king of Kāśi, who 
was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by 
Sātrājita Śatānīka. The fact that the latter was a Bharata 
also points to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's not having been a Kuru-Pañcāla at 
all. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā he appears as having a dispute 
with Vaka Dālbhi; but even assuming that the latter was 
a Pañcāla, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru 
or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and 
Pañcāla.
	4 It is true that in the Epic Śantanu and Vicitravīrya 
and Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself are all connected, but this connexion 
seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derange
ment of great figures of the past. 1) x. 6. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 
3, 469 et seq. 2) As does Weber, Indian Literature, 
90, 114, 125; Episches im vedischen Ritual, 
7, 8. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v., treats them as identical. 3) xiii. 5, 4, 22. 4) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1908, 831 et seq. This argument 
is independent of the identification of 
the two Dhṛtarāṣṭras, but is confirmed 
by it.

धृष्टि
धृष्टि,
 found in the dual in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,
	1 the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 and the Sūtras,
	3 seems to denote ‘fire
tongs.’ 1) v. 9, 8. 2) xiv. 3, 1, 22. 3) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxvi. 2, 
10, etc.

धेना
धेना
 denotes a ‘milch cow,’
	1 or in the plural, ‘draughts of 
milk.’
	2 In two passages
	3 Roth
	4 takes the word to mean ‘mare,’ 
and in another the ‘team’ of Vāyu's chariot. Benfey,
	6 on the 
other hand, renders it ‘lips’ in one passage,
	7 with Sāyaṇa and 
with Durga's commentary on the Nirukta.
	8 Geldner
	9 assigns 
to the word the senses of ‘lips,’
	10 ‘speech,’
	11 ‘cow,’
	12 ‘beloved,’
	13 
and ‘streams.’

धेनु
धेनु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 means ‘milch cow,’ which 
is often mentioned with special reference to the production of 
milk,
	3 and is contrasted with the ‘bull’ (vṛṣabha,
	4 pumāṃs,
	5 
anaḍvāh).
	6 In the plural
	7 the word denotes ‘draughts of milk.’ 
The derivative, dhenukā, means merely ‘female.’

धेनुष्टरी
धेनु-ष्टरी
 in the Kāṭhaka (xiii. 6) and Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 
(ii. 5, 4) denotes a cow which has ceased to give milk.

धैवर
धैवर
 means a ‘fisherman,’ as a member of a caste,
	1 in 
the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ in 
the Yajurveda.
	2 Cf. Dhīvara. 1) This seems to be shown by the 
patronymic form, ‘descendant of a 
dhīvara.’ 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Tait 
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1.

ध्मातृ
ध्मातृ
 (lit. ‘blower’) occurs twice in one passage of the 
Rigveda
	1 in the two forms, dhmātā, nom. ‘smelter,’ and 
dhmātarī, which, according to the Padapāṭha, stands for 
dhmātari, a locative probably meaning ‘in the smelting furnace.’
	2 
Geldner,
	3 Bartholomae,
	4 and Oldenburg
	5 regard the latter form 
as a locative infinitive, ‘in the smelting.’ Ludwig
	6 and Neisser
	7 
think dhmātarī is a nom. sing. masc. used in the same sense as 
dhmātā. Smelting is also clearly referred to,
	8 and the smelter 
is described as using the wings of birds (parṇa śakunānām) to 
fan the flame.
	9 That the art was widely applied is shown by 
the fact that reference is made to arrows with points of Ayas,
	10 
to kettles which were fashioned of the same metal and could be 
placed upon a fire,
	11 and to Soma cups of beaten Ayas.

ध्रुव
ध्रुव
 in the Sūtras
	1 denotes the pole star, being mentioned 
in connexion with the marriage ritual, in which the star is 
pointed out to the bride as an emblem of constancy. In the 
Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad,
	2 a late work, the movement of the 
Dhruva (dhruvasya pracalanam) is mentioned, but this can hardly 
be interpreted as referring to an actual observed motion of the 
nominal pole star,
	3 but rather to an extraordinary event, such 
as a destruction of the world, as Cowell understood the 
expression.
	4 Jacobi
	5 sees in the motion of the Dhruva the 
possibility of fixing a date, on the ground that the only star 
which could have been deemed a pole star, as ‘immovable,’ was 
one (a Draconis) of the third millennium B.C. But this attempt 
to extract chronology from the name of the star is of very 
doubtful validity.

It is to be noted that the marriage 
Mantras, of which we have a great 
many, do not include any reference to 
the Dhruva; but it is not possible to 
say definitely whether the practice is 
really an old one or not 2) See Max Müller, Sacred Books of

ध्रुवा
ध्रुवा,
 ‘fixed,’ as an epithet of Diś, ‘cardinal point,’ denotes 
the ground under one's feet. 
1) Av. iii. 27, 5; xii. 3, 59; xv. 6, 1;

25, etc.

ध्वज
ध्वज
 occurs twice in the Rigveda
	1 in the sense of ‘banner’ 
used in battle. It is characteristic of Vedic fighting that in 
both passages reference is made to arrows being discharged and 
falling on the banners. 1) vii. 85, 2; x. 103, 11. In Epic 
warfare banners are of vast importance 
-e.g., Rāmāyaṇa, ii. 67, 26; they were 
attached to a pole on the chariot, 
Mahabhārata, vii. 3332, etc. The army 
was called dhvajinī, ‘bannered host,’ 
ibid., i. 2875, etc.

ध्वन्य
ध्वन्य
 is apparently the name of a patron, son of Lakṣ- 
maṇa, in a hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 1) v. 33, 10. Cf. Ludwig Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155.

ध्वसन्द्वैतवन
ध्वसन् द्वैत-वन
 (‘descendant of Dvitavana’) is the 
name in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 of the king of the Matsyas 
who celebrated an Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ near the 
Sarasvatī. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 9. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 211; Episches im vedischen 
Ritual, 6.

ध्वसन्ति
ध्वसन्ति
 is in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 mentioned 
together with Puruṣanti as having been aided by the Aśvins. 
There can be no doubt that this is the longer form of the name 
Dhvasra, which is found with Puruṣanti both in the Rigveda
	2 
and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	3 1) i. 112, 23. 2) ix. 58. 3 = Sv. ii. 409. 3) xiii. 7, 12 (where the dual of 
Dhvasra appears as a feminine Dhvasre). 
Cf. Sieg. Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 
62, 63; Benfey, Sāmaveda, 105, 126, 
who is inclined to think that Dhvasanti 
and Puruṣanti are names of women.

ध्वस्र
ध्वस्र
 is named with Puruṣanti in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa
	1 as giving gifts to Taranta and Purumīḍha. These two, 
being kings, could not
	2 properly accept gifts which Brāhmaṇas 
alone could accept, but by becoming authors of a verse of the 
Rigveda
	3 they qualified themselves to accept them. The verse 
mentions the names in the dual as Dhvasrayoḥ Puruṣantyoḥ, 
‘from the two, Dhvasra and Puruṣanti.’
	4 In the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	5 the names occur in the dual as Dhvasre Puruṣantī, 
a reading which is confirmed by the Nidāna Sūtra.
	6 The 
former is necessarily a feminine form, though Sāyaṇa, in his 
comment on the passage, explains it as really an irregular 
masculine. According to Roth,
	7 the feminine is a corruption 
based on the dual form in the verse of the Rigveda mentioned 
above; but the names may be those of women,
	8 as Benfey
	9 
inclines to believe. Weber
	10 suggests that the two were 
demons, but this is, as Sieg
	11 shows, quite unnecessary. 
Dhvasra is no doubt identical with Dhvasanti. 1) xiii. 7, 12. Cf. Jaiminīya Brāh
maṇa, iii. 139; Sāṭyāyanaka, apud 
Sāyaṇa, on Rv. ix. 58, 3. 2) Mānava Dharma Śāstra, x. 75, 77. 3) ix. 58, 3. 4) Both words are in the dual, as if 
they were members of a Dvandva com
pound. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 
261. 5) Loc. cit. 6) ix. 9. 7) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
dhvasra. 8) The first would in that case be 
Dhvasrā. 9) Sāmaveda, 105. 126, under Dhvasanti 
and Puruṣanti. 10) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 27,

veda, 3, 139; Oertel, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 18, 39; Max 
Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 
360, points out that the sense of the 
Rīgveda passage is quite uncertain, 
and that the two, Taranta and Puru
mīḷha, as they appear in Rv. v. 61, 
are rather donors than receivers (see, 
however, verse 9, Purumīṭhāya viprāva).

ध्वाङ्क्ष
ध्वाङ्क्ष,
 ‘crow,’ is mentioned twice in the Atharvaveda,
	1 
and in the Sūtras.
	2 Possibly the same bird is meant by the 
words Dhuṅkṣā and Dhūṅksnā. 1) xi. 9, 9; xii. 4, 8. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra xxv. 6, 9.

ध्वान्त
ध्वान्त
 is the name of some wind in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 
and later.

Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxix. 7. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 16, 1; 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, iv. 24, 1; 25, 1.

नकुल
नकुल,
 ‘ichneumon,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 as 
being able to cut a snake in two and then join it up again. 
Its knowledge
	2 of a remedy against snake poison is also 
mentioned. The animal figures in the list of sacrificial victims 
at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās.

In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 18, 1; 
Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvii. 9, nakula 
denotes a colour — no doubt that of the 
ichneumon.

नक्त
नक्त,
 ‘night,’ is found frequently in the Rigveda,
	1 and 
sometimes later,
	2 usually in the adverbial form naktaṃ, ‘by 
night’ 1) i. 13, 7; 73, 7; 96, 5; vii. 2, 6; 
x. 70, 6; adverbially, i. 24, 10; 90, 7; 
v. 76, 3; vii. 15, 15; 104, 17; viii. 96, 1. 2) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 4, 2, 
adverbially, Av. vi. 128, 4; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 2; xiii. 1, 5, 5, etc.

नक्षत्र
नक्षत्र
 is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The 
Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion 
as to its primary meaning. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 re
solves it into na-kṣatra (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend. 
The Nirukta
	2 refers it to the root nakṣ, ‘obtain,’ following the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 Aufrecht
	4 and Weber
	5 derived it from 
nakta-tra, ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently
	6 the derivation 
from nak-kṣatra, ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining 
acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems 
to be ‘star.’ 
The Nakṣatras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later. — The sense 
of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages 
in which Nakṣatra occurs in the Rigveda.
	7 The same sense 
occurs in the later Saṃhitās also: the sun and the Nakṣatras are 
mentioned together,
	8 or the sun, the moon, and the Nakṣatras,
	9 
or the moon and the Nakṣatras,
	10 or the Nakṣatras alone;
	11 
but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of 
‘lunar mansion’ in these passages. 
On the other hand, the names of at least three of the 
Nakṣatras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. Tiṣya,
	12 
however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion. 
With Aghās (plur.) and Arjunī (dual)
	13 the case is different: 
it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called 
Maghās (plur.) and Phalgunī (dual). The names appear to 
have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be 
remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding 
hymn of Sūryā, has no claim to great age.
	14 Ludwig
	15 and 
Zimmer
	16 have seen other references to the Nakṣatras as 
27 in the Rigveda,
	17 but these seem most improbable. Nor 
do the adjectives revatī (‘rich’) and punarvasā (‘bringing 
wealth again’) in another hymn
	18 appear to refer to the 
Nakṣatras. 
The Nakṣatras as Lunar Mansions. — In several passages of the 
later Saṃhitās the connexion of the moon and the Nakṣatras 
is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the Kāṭhaka
	19 
and Taittirīya Saṃhitās
	20 it is expressly stated that Soma was 
wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with Rohiṇī; the 
others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with 
them all equally. Weber
	21 hence deduced that the Nakṣatras 
were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts 
unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The 
number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in 
the two Saṃhitās: the Taittīriya has 33, and the Kāṭhaka no 
number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is 
found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	22 and elsewhere.
	23 The 
number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	24 Abhijit is practically marked as a new 
comer, though in a later book,
	25 in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
	26 
and in the Atharvaveda list,
	27 it has found acceptance. It is 
perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that Abhijit 
dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because 
27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that 
the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Manāzil are 28 in number.
	28 
Weber,
	29 however, believes that 27 is the older number in 
India. 
The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is 
remembered that a periodic month occupies something between 
27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month 
is in fact recognized in the Lāṭyāyana
	30 and Nidāna Sūtras
	31 
as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days, 
a Nakṣatra year, or with an intercalary month, a year of 
351 days. The Nidāna Sūtra
	32 makes an attempt to introduce 
the Nakṣatra reckoning into the civil or solar (sāvana) year 
of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in 
each Nakṣatra (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or 
28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the 
Veda.
	33 
The Names of the Nakṣatras. — In addition to the two men
tioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda
	34 gives the 
names of Jyeṣṭhaghnī
	35 (the later Jyeṣṭhā) and Vicṛtau,
	36 which 
are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revatīs (plural) 
and Kṛttikās.
	37 With reference to possible times for the 
ceremony of the Agnyādhāna, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’ 
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	38 the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
	39 and the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	40 mention the Nakṣatras called Kṛttikās, 
Rohiṇī, Phalgunyas, Hasta; the latter Brāhmaṇa adds Punar
vasū, and in an additional remark
	41 excludes Pūrve Phalgunī 
in favour of Uttare Phalgunī. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	42 
adds Mṛgaśīrṣa and Citrā as possibilities. On the other hand, 
Punarvasū is recommended by all authorities
	43 as suitable for 
the Punarādheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes 
place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence, 
the prosperity of the sacrificer.
	44 The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	45 
however, allows Anurādhās also. 
In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the fire
altar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the 
Nakṣatras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to 
27 Nakṣatras multiplied by 27 secondary Nakṣatras, reckoned 
as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length 
of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived 
from this piece of priestly nonsense.
	46 But in connexion with 
this ceremony the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	47 enumerate the 27 
Nakṣatras, and these lists
	48 may be given in extenso as 
follows:

The Taittirīya Brahmaṇa
	49 has a list of the Nakṣatras 
which agrees generally with the list of the Saṃhitās. It runs 
as follows: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Invakās, Bāhū (dual), Tiṣya, 
Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrve Phalgunī, Uttare Phalgunī, Hasta, 
Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, Anūrādhās, Rohiṇī, Mūlabarhaṇī, 
Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās, Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, 
Pūrve Proṣṭhapadās, Uttare Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, Aśvayujau, 
Apabharaṇīs. In a later book,
	50 however, the list grows to 28, 
and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new 
moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Nākṣatra 
(lunar) month into accordance with the Sāvana (solar) month 
of 30 days. The names in this second list are as in the 
Saṃhitās with the following exceptions. The seven stars of 
the Kṛttikās are named as Ambā, Dulā, Nitatnī, Abhrayantī, 
Meghayantī, Varṣayantī, Cupuṇīkā, names found also in the 
Taittirīya
	51 and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās.
	52 Beside Mṛgaśīrṣa, Invakās 
are also mentioned.
	53 Then come Ārdrā, Punarvasū, Tiṣya, 
Āśreṣās, Maghās (beside which Anaghās, Agadās, and Arun
dhatīs are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the 
dual, Phalgunyau),
	54 Phalgunyas, Hasta, Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, 
Anūrādhās, Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, Aṣāḍhās, Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śronā, 
Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Proṣṭhapadās, Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, 
Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas, but also Apabharaṇīs.
	55 Abhijit, which 
occurs also in an earlier part of the Brāhmaṇa,
	56 is perhaps 
interpolated. But Weber's
	57 argument that Abhijit is out of 
place in this list because Brāhmaṇa is here mentioned as the 
28th Nakṣatra, loses some force from the fact (of course unknown 
to him) that the list in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	58 contains 
28 Nakṣatras, including Abhijit, and adds Brāhmaṇa at the end 
as another. 
In another passage
	59 the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa divides the 
Nakṣatras into two sets, the Deva Nakṣatras and the Yama 
Nakṣatras, being 1-14 and 15-27 (with the omission of Abhijit) 
respectively. This division corresponds with one in the third 
book of the Brāhmaṇa
	60 where the days of the light half of 
the month and those of the dark half are equated with the 
Nakṣatras. The Brāhmaṇa treats the former series as south, 
the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and 
can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity. 
The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a 
list
	61 of the Nakṣatras, including Abhijit. The names here 
given are: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasū, 
Puṣya, Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrvā Phalgunyau (sic),
	62 Hasta, 
Citrā, Svāti (masc.),
	63 Viśākhe, Anurādhā,
	64 Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, 
Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās,
	65 Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhās, 
Śatabhiṣaj, Dvayā Proṣṭhapadā, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas. 
The Position of the Nakṣatras. — There is nothing definite in 
Vedic literature regarding the position of most of the Nakṣatras, 
but the later astronomy precisely locates all of them, and its 
statements agree on the whole satisfactorily with what is said 
in the earlier texts, though Weber
	66 was inclined to doubt this.

कृत्तिकास्
1. Kṛttikās are unquestionably  Tauri, etc., the Pleiades. 
The names of the seven stars forming this constellation, and 
given above from Yajurveda texts,
	68 include three — abhrayantī, 
‘forming clouds’; meghayantī, ‘making cloudy’; varṣayantī, 
‘causing rain’ — which clearly refer to the rainy Pleiades. The 
word kṛttikā possibly means ‘web,’ from the root kṛt, ‘spin.’ 68) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 5, 1; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xl. 4; Taittīrīya 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 4, 1.

रोहिणी
2. Rohiṇī, ‘ruddy,’ is the name of the conspicuously reddish 
star, a Tauri or Aldebaran, and denotes the group of the 
Hyades,  Tauri. Its identification seems absolutely 
assured by the legend of Prajāpati in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	69 
He is there represented as pursuing his daughter with incestuous 
intention, and as having been shot with an arrow (Iṣu Trikāṇḍā, 
‘the belt of Orion’) by the ‘huntsman’ (Mṛgavyādha, 
‘Sirius’). Prajāpati is clearly Orion (Mṛgaśiras being the 
name of the little group of stars in Orion's head). 69) iii. 33. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 1, 2, 8; Tilak, Orion, 98 et seq.

मृगशीर्ष
3. Mṛgaśīrṣa or Mṛgaśiras, also called Invakā or Invagā, 
seems to be the faint stars , Orionis. They are called 
Andhakā, ‘blind,’ in the Śāntikalpa of the Atharvaveda, 
probably because of their dimness.

102 et seq.

आर्द्रा
4. Ārdrā, ‘moist,’ is the name of the brilliant star,  Orionis. 
But the names by which it is styled, in the plural as Ārdrās in 
the Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra
	71 and the Nakṣatrakalpa,
	72 and 
in the dual as Bāhū, in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	73 point to a 
constellation of two or more stars, and it may be noted
	74 that 
the corresponding Chinese Sieou includes the seven brilliant 
stars composing the shoulders, the belt, and the knees of 
Orion. 71) i. 26. 72) 10. 73) i. 5, 1. 74) Whitney, op. cit., 352, 401, n. 1.

पुनर्वसू
5. Punarvasū, ‘the two that give wealth again,’ denotes the 
two stars,  and  Geminorum, on the heads of Castor and 
Pollux. The name is no doubt connected with the beneficent 
character of the Aśvins, who correspond to the Dioscuri.

Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 53.

तिष्य
6. Tiṣya or Puṣya includes the somewhat faint group in the 
body of the Crab, , and  Cancri. The singular is rather 
curious, as primarily one star would seem to have been meant. 
and none of the group is at all prominent.
	76 76) Whitney, op. cit., 403, n. 1.

आश्रेषास्
7. Āśreṣās or Āśleṣās, which in some texts
	77 is certainly to 
be read Aśreṣās or Aśleṣas, denotes , and perhaps 
also , Hydræ. The word means ‘embracer,’ a name which 
admirably fits the constellation. 77) Aśreṣās, Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra,

Aśleṣās, Śāntikalpa, 2; Nakṣatrakalpa,

मघास्
8. Maghās, the ‘bounties,’ are the Sickle, or , 
Leonis. The variants Anaghā, the ‘sinless one,’ etc., clearly 
refer to the auspicious influence of the constellation. 
9, 10. Phalgunī, Phalgunyau, Phalgū,
	78 Phalgunīs, Phal- 
gunyas, is really a-double constellation, divided into Pūrve, 
‘former,’ and Uttare, ‘latter.’ The former is  and  Leonis, 
the latter  and 93 Leonis. According to Weber, the word 
denotes, like Arjunī, the variant of the Rigveda,
	79 a ‘bright
coloured’ constellation. 78) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 1. 79) x. 85, 13.

हस्त
11. Hasta, ‘hand,’ is made up of the five conspicuous stars 
() in Corvus, a number which the word itself 
suggests. According to Geldner,
	80 the ‘five bulls’ of the 
Rigveda are this constellation. 80) Vedische Studien, 3, 177; Rv. i. 105, 
10. Cf. below, p. 427, n. 156.

चित्रा
12. Citrā, ‘bright,’ is the beautiful star,  Virginis. It is 
mentioned in a legend of Indra in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	81 
and in that of the ‘two divine dogs’ (divyau śvānau) in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa.
	82 81) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 4-6. 82) ii. 1, 2, 13-17.

स्वाती
13. Svātī or Niṣṭyā is later clearly the brilliant star Arcturus 
or  Bootis, its place in the north being assured by the notice 
in the Śāntikalpa,
	83 where it is said to be ‘ever traversing the 
northern way’ (nityam uttara-mārgagam). The Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	84 however, constructs an asterismal Prajāpati, 
giving him Citrā (a Virginis) for head, Hasta (Corvus) for 
hand, the Viśākhe (a and  Libræ) for thighs, and the 
Anurādhās (, and  Scorpionis) for standing place, with 
Niṣṭyā for heart. But Arcturus, being 30º out, spoils this 
figure, while, on the other hand, the Arabic and Chinese 
systems have respectively, instead of Arcturus, , and  
Virginis and  Virginis, which would well fit into the Prajāpati 
figure. But in spite of the force of this argument of Weber's,
	85 
Whitney
	86 is not certain that Niṣṭyā here must mean a star in 
Virgo, pointing out that the name Niṣṭyā, ‘outcast,’ suggests 
the separation of this Nakṣatra from the others in question. 83) 3. 84) i. 5, 2. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 204. 85) Op. cit., 2, 307, 308. 86) Op. cit., 409.

विशाखे
14. Viśākhe is the couple of stars  and  Libræ. This 
mansion is later called Rādhā according to the Amarakośa, and 
it is curious that in the Atharvaveda
	87 the expression rādho 
Viśākhe, ‘the Viśākhe are prosperity,’ should occur. But 
probably Rādhā is merely an invention due to the name of the 
next Nakṣatra, Anurādhā, wrongly conceived as meaning ‘that 
which is after or follows Rādhā.’

अनूराधास्
15. Anūrādhās or Anurādhā, ‘propitious,’ is , and  
(perhaps also ) Scorpionis.

रोहिणी
16. Rohiṇī, ‘ruddy’; Jyeṣṭhaghnī, ‘slaying the eldest’; or 
Jyeṣṭhā, ‘eldest,’ is the name of the constellation , and  
Scorpionis, of which the central star, , is the brilliant reddish 
Antares (or Cor Scorpionis).

विचृतौ
17. Vicṛtau, ‘the two releasers’; Mūla, ‘root’; or Mūla- 
barhaṇī, ‘uprooting,’ denote primarily  and  at the extremity 
of the tail of the Scorpion, but including also the nine or 
eleven stars from  to . 
18, 19. Aṣāḍhās (‘unconquered’), distinguished as Pūrvās, 
‘former,’ and Uttarās, ‘latter,’ are really two constellations, of 
which the former is composed of , and  Sagittarii, or of  and  only, and the latter of , and  Sagittarii, or of two,  and , only. It is probable that originally only four stars 
forming a square were meant as included in the whole con
stellation
	89 — viz.,  and , with  and . 
20. Abhijit is the brilliant star  Lyræ with its two com
panions  and . Its location in 60º north latitude is completely 
discordant with the position of the corresponding Arabian and 
Chinese asterisms. This fact is considered by Oldenberg
	90 to 
support the view that it was a later addition to the system; its 
occurrence, however, as early as the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
	91 
which he does not note, somewhat invalidates
	92 that view. In 
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	93 Abhijit is said to be ‘over Aṣāḍhās, 
under Śroṇā,’ which Weber
	94 held to refer to its position in 
space, inferring thence that its Vedic position corresponded to 
that of the Arab Manāzil and the Chinese Sieou — viz., , 
Capricorni. But Whitney
	95 argues effectively that the words 
‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of Abhijit in the 
list, ‘after’ Aṣāḍhās and ‘before’ Śroṇā. 89) Cf. Thibaut, Journal of the Asiatic 
Society of Bengal, 63, 156. 90) Nachrichten der königl. Gesellschaft 
der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 
551, 552. 91) ii. 13, 20. 92) It is at the same time to be noted

Taittirīya Saṃhitā and in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā lists. 93) i. 5, 2, 3. 94) Op. cit., 1, 320, 321; 2, 307;

श्रोणा
21. Śroṇā, ‘lame,’ or Śravaṇa, ‘ear,’ denotes the bright star  Aquilæ with  below and  above it. Weber
	96 very need 
lessly thinks that the name Śravaṇa suggested two ears and the 
head between. It is quite out of correspondence with the 
Manāzil and the Sieou, and is clearly an Indian invention.

22. Śraviṣṭhās, ‘most famous,’ or later Dhaniṣṭhās,
	98 ‘most 
wealthy,’ is the diamond-shaped group, , and , in the 
Dolphin, perhaps also  in the same constellation. Like the 
preceding Nakṣatra, it is out of harmony with the Manāzil and 
Sieou. 98) Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 26;

conceived as numbering a hundred.

latter (uttara) of  Pegasi and  Andromedæ. 99) So probably in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃ

southernmost.

अपभरणीस्
28. Apabharaṇīs, Bharaṇīs, or Bharaṇyas, ‘the bearers,’ is 
the name of the small triangle in the northern part of the Ram 
known as Musca or 35, 39, and 41 Arietis. 
The Nakṣatras and the Months. — In the Brāhmaṇas the 
Nakṣatra names are regularly used to denote dates. This is 
done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may 
be turned into a feminine and compounded with pūrṇa-māsa, 
‘the full moon,’ as in Tiṣyā-pūrṇamāsa, ‘the full moon in the 
Nakṣatra Tiṣya.’
	103 Much more often, however, it is turned 
into a derivative adjective, used with paurṇamāsī, ‘the full 
moon (night),’ or with amāvāsyā, ‘the new moon (night),’ as in 
Phālgunī paurṇamāsī, ‘the full-moon night in the Nakṣatra 
Phalgunī’;
	104 or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the Nakṣatra adjec
tive alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month 
itself is called by a name derived
	105 from that of a Nakṣatra, 
but only Phālguna,
	106 Caitra,
	107 Vaiśākha,
	108 Taiṣya,
	109 Māgha
	110 
occur in the Brāhmaṇas, the complete list later being Phālguna, 
Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyaiṣṭha, Āṣāḍha, Śrāvaṇa, Prauṣṭhapada, 
Āśvayuja, Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Taiṣya, Māgha. Strictly 
speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar 
year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as 
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa there was a tendency to equate lunar 
months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up 
the solar year (see Māsa). 
The Nakṣatras and Chronology. — (1) An endeavour has been 
made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at 
which the systematic employment of those names was intro
duced. Sir William Jones
	111 refers to this possibility, and 
Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always 
marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the 
months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber
	112 considered 
that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but 
Whitney
	113 has convincingly shown that it is an impossible 
feat, and Thibaut
	114 concurs in this view. Twelve became 
fixed as the number of the months because of the desire, 
evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize 
lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras 
out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon 
can have no chronological significance, because full moon at 
no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods 
occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly re
current intervals. 
(2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is 
only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this 
fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with Aśvinī, 
and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its 
adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star  Piscium 
on the border of Revatī and Aśvinī,
	115 say in the course of the 
sixth century A.D. Weber
	116 has therefore accepted the view 
that the Kṛttikās were chosen for a similar reason, and the 
date at which that Nakṣatra coincided with the vernal equinox 
has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C.
	117 
A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the 
sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with 
the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut
	118 and Oldenberg
	119 have 
pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the 
equinox with the Kṛttikās. Jacobi
	120 has contended that in 
the Rigveda
	121 the commencement of the rains and the summer 
solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the 
old, and that further the new year began with the summer 
solstice in Phalgunī.
	121 He has also referred to the distinction 
of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa
	122 as supporting his view of the connexion of the 
sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory: 
the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except 
by translating the word dvādaśa
	123 as ‘the twelfth (month)’ 
instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted 
interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all 
satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It 
may further be mentioned that even if the Nakṣatra of Kṛttikās 
be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with 
the vernal equinox, both Whitney
	124 and Thibaut
	125 are pre
pared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date 
given by the Jyotiṣa, which puts the winter solstice in Māgha. 
(3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a Brāhmaṇa 
text, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	126 expressly places it in the 
new moon of Māgha (māghasyāmāvāsyāyām). It is not very 
important whether we take this with the commentators
	127 as 
the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the 
day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as 
the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in 
Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch 
in the following way. If the end of Revatī marked the vernal 
equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would 
enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox 
was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha, 
when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of 
Śraviṣṭhās. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third 
quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from Śraviṣṭhās, and 
the difference between that and the beginning of Aśvinī= 
1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)º (27 asterisms being = 360º). Taking the 
starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Varāha Mihira, 
Jones
	128 arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox 
corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha — that is, on the 
basis of 1º = 72 years as the precession. Pratt
	129 arrived at 
precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and 
adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas 
of the junction star
	130 of Maghā,  Leonis or Regulus. Davis
	131 
and Colebrooke
	132 arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by 
taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citrā, 
which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as 
3º in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century 
has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation 
in the Jyotiṣa,
	133 it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney 
points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms 
coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)º extent 
each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups 
of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the 
result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions 
was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether 
out of their asterisms.
	134 Nor can we say that the star  Piscium 
early formed the eastern boundary of Revatī; it may possibly 
not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote 
from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revatī. 
Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point — 
582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants
	135 — is the fact that 
the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determin
able by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of 
the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate 
observers, since they made no precise determination of the 
number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotiṣa they do 
not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even 
the Sūrya Siddhānta
	136 does not know the precession of the 
equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years 
for possible errors,
	137 and the only probable conclusion to be 
drawn from the datum of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa is that it 
was recording an observation which must have been made some 
centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the 
probable date of the Brāhmaṇa literature,
	138 say B.C. 800-600. 
(4) Another chronological argument has been derived from 
the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for 
Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year, 
since the full moon in Phalgunī is often described as the 
‘mouth (mukham) of the year.’
	139 Jacobi
	140 considers that this 
was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter 
solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna 
about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg
	141 and Thibaut,
	142 on the other 
hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of 
the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This 
view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence
	143 
of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring: 
as we have seen above in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, the new 
moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice,
	144 which puts 
the full moon of Phalgunī at a month and a half after the 
winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in 
itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with 
the February 7 of the veris initium in the Roman Calendar. 
This fact accords with the only natural division of the year 
into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from 
June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set 
of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see 
Cāturmāsya). Tilak,
	145 on the other hand, holds that the 
winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī 
and Caitrī in early periods — viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 6000
4000. 
(5) The passages of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	146 and the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	147 which treat the full moon in Phālguna as 
the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon 
in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to 
secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of 
spring,
	148 and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period 
when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another 
alternative is the Ekāṣṭakā, interpreted by the commentators as 
the eighth day after the full moon in Maghās, a time which 
might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old 
year, well be considered as representing the end of the year. 
A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full 
moon meant must be that of Caitra, as Ālekhana quoted by 
Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and 
the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes.
	149 
(6) Others, again, according to the Gṛhya ritual, began the 
year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name 
Āgrahāyaṇa
	150 (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’). 
Jacobi and Tilak
	151 think that this one denoted the autumn 
equinox in Mṛgaśiras, corresponding to the winter solstice in 
Phalgunī. But, as Thibaut
	152 shows clearly, it was selected as 
the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with 
autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra 
instead of Phālguna.
	153 
(7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler,
	154 
from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the 
Gṛhya Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the 
rains (as in the Buddhist vassā) which mark the summer 
solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the 
date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus 
because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadra
padās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the 
case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney
	155 
has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we 
cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the 
rains and learning — a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred 
because of its connexion with the word Śravaṇa, ‘ear’ — and 
in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that 
Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence 
with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so 
to coincide.
	156 
The Origin of the Nakṣatras. — As we have seen, there is no 
evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may 
have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in 
the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of 
them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally 
in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās the 
full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians 
show (see Graha) a remarkably small knowledge of the other 
astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar 
mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On 
the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very 
complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star 
group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus 
impossible a priori to deny that the Vedic Indians could have 
invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac.
	157 
But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist 
two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in 
China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in 
Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by 
them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with 
the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might 
therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a 
mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the 
Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the 
Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old 
Testament
	158 may really be the lunar mansions.
	159 That the 
Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess
	160 held, is, 
on the other hand, not at all probable. 
Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers 
published by him between 1839 and 1861,
	161 attempted to prove 
the derivation of the Nakṣatra from the Chinese Sieou. The 
latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all. 
He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern 
astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars 
observed in the neighbourhood can be referred; they were, as 
regards twenty-four of them, selected about B.C. 2357 on 
account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having 
the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had 
attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were 
added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices 
of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with 
Mao (= Kṛttikās), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357. 
Weber,
	162 in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory, 
and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for 
the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third 
century B.C. The last point does not appear
	163 to be correct, 
but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were rein
forced by Whitney,
	164 who insisted that Biot's supposition of 
the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of 
lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest 
defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold 
de Saussure,
	165 , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin 
for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg,
	166 
who has also pointed out
	167 that the series does not begin with 
Mao (= Kṛttikās). 
There remains only the possibility that a common source for 
all the three sets — Nakṣatra, Manāzil, and Sieou — may be 
found in Babylonia. Hommel
	168 has endeavoured to show 
that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence 
of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the 
Pleiades (= Kṛttikās); but Thibaut's researches
	169 are not 
favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber,
	170 
Whitney,
	171 Zimmer,
	172 and Oldenberg
	173 all incline to the 
view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system, 
and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable 
view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in 
Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the 
Ādityas,
	174 and possibly the word Manā. 103) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 10, 1.

pointed out its relation to the datum 
of the Jyotiṣa. The same date as that 
of the Jyotiṣa is found in a passage of 
the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra cited by 
Shamasastry, Gavām Ayana, 137 (māghe 
māse dhaniṣṭhābhir uttareṇaiti bhānumān, 
ardhāśleṣasya śrāvaṇasya dakṣiṇenopani- 
vartate, ‘in the month of Māgha the 
sun goes north with the asterism 
Dhaniṣṭhās, in the month of Śrāvaṇa 
he returns south in the middle of the 
asterism Āśleṣa’; the sense is clear, 
though the text is corrupt). The passage 
is apparently not in Caland's manu
scripts, or he would have mentioned 
it in his paper, Über das vituelle Sūtra 
des Baudhāyana, 36, 37. Its date and 
value are therefore not quite certain. 127) Vināyaka on Kauṣītaki Brāh
maṇa, loc. cit.; Ānartīya on Śāṅkh
āyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 19, 1; Weber,

the scholiasts seems to be due to the 
fact that to their minds a month must 
end with a new moon (amānta) or with 
full moon (pūrṇimānta). But there is 
no reason to say that in Vedic times 
the month may not have commenced 
with the new moon; the Kauṣītaki 
passage would thus be quite satisfac
torily explained. 128) Asiatic Researches, 2, 393. 129) Journal of the Asiatic Society of

only in his popular works (Chips, 1,

rather 1186 B.C, as recalculated by Main 
from Pratt's calculation. Shamasastry's 
defence, Gavām Ayana, 122 et seq., of 
the Jyotiṣa shows a misunderstanding 
the criticisms made. See Keith,

See also Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 3; Hille
brandt, Rituallitteratur, 31, who are in
clined to accept an early date, fourth 
or fifth century B.C., for the Āpastamba 
Sūtras, from which a still earlier date 
for the Brāhmaṇas must be conceded. 
But Eggeling is more probably correct 
when he assigns the Āpastamba Sūtras 
to the third century, B.C. See Sacred 
Books of the East, 12, xl, and it seems 
unwise unduly to press back the date 
of Vedic literature. It is noteworthy 
that in the Epic the solstice is still in 
Māgha (Mahābhārata, xiii. 168, 6. 28). 
Reference is, however, made (ibid., i. 71, 
34) to the Nakṣatras commencing with 
Śravaṇa, and the first month is Mārga
śīrṣa (see Hopkins, Journal of the

(i. 2, 23) āgra-hāyaṇā as a synonym of 
Mṛgaśiras, and on certain myths (chaps.

Society, 16, lxxxiv et seq. 156) Mention should here be made of 
the following points: (1) Jacobi's argu
ment from the word Dhruva, the name 
of the star pointed out to the bride in 
the marriage ritual. The word does 
not occur in the literature anterior to 
the Gṛhya Sūtras, and it must remain 
an undecided question whether the 
practice was or was not old. Jacobi 
urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and 
that it must originally have referred to 
a real fixed pole star, and he thinks 
that such a star could only be found 
in the third millennium B.C. Whitney 
and Oldenberg definitely reject this 
view on the ground that too much 
must not be made out of a piece of 
folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual 
requirements would be satisfied by any 
star of some magnitude which was 
approximately polar. This conclusion 
seems convincing. Cf. Keith, Journal 
of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 1102; 
1910, 465; contra, Jacobi, ibid., 1909, 
726 et seq.; 1910, 464. (2) The Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts 
that the Kṛttikās do not move from 
the eastern quarter, which the others 
do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi, 
Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 
463, 464) upon this assertion as giving 
a date of the third millennium B.C. for 
the Śatapatha observation. But this 
notice is quite inadequate to support 
any such result, and its lack of trust
worthiness as a chronological guide is 
increased by the fact that the Baudhā
yana Śrauta Sūtra, xviii 5, has a similar 
notice, coupled with another notice, 
which, according to Barth, would only 
be true somewhere in or after the sixth 
century A.D., the equatorial point being 
placed between Citrā and Svātī, which 
in the early period were both very 
much north of the equator (see Caland, 
Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 
37-39). The same passage of the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the 
Mādhyaṃdina recension, states that 
the number of the Kṛttikās is greater 
than that of the stars in any of the 
other Nakṣatras, which consist of one, 
two, three, or four stars, or which, 
according to the Kāṇva recension (see 
Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 
282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not 
possible to put much faith in this asser
tion, for Hasta later has five stars, and 
its name (with reference to the fingers) 
suggests five (cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 
368, 381), and that number is possibly 
referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10). 
See Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 177. 
(3) Attempts have been made to regard 
the names of the Nakṣatras as signifi
cant of their position in the list. Thus 
Bentley, Historical View, 2, thought 
Viśākhā was so called because the 
equinoctial colure divided the equator 
about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by 
Tilak, Orion, 57 et seq. Jyeṣṭhaghnī 
has been interpreted as ‘slaying the 
eldest’ — i.e., as marking the new year 
by putting an end to the old year. 
Tilak, 90, suggests that Mūla was so 
called because its acronycal rising 
marked the beginning of the year when 
the vernal equinox was near Mṛgaśiras. 
More probable is Whitney's view, Sārya 
Siddhānta, 194, that it was the most 
southern, and so, as it were, the basis 
of the asterisms. 157) Max Müller, Rigveda, 4^2, xliv 
et seq., maintains the Indian origin of the 
system. Thrbaut, Astronomie, Astrologie 
und Mathematik, 14, 15, admits it to be 
possible, as does Whitney, Oriental and 
Linguistic Essays, 2, 418. 158) 2 Kings xxiii. 5; Job xxxviii. 32. 159) Weber, Naxatra, 1, 317, 318;

view also, according to Whitney, 413

it (see Indische Studien, 9, 425, 426; 10, 
246, 247). On the other hand, Sédillot, 
Matériaux pour servir à l'histoire com- 
parée des 'Sciences Mathématiques par les 
Grecs et les Orientaux (Paris, 1845-1849), 
favoured influence from Arabia on 
India. 161) Summed up in his two works,

Studien, 10, 246, and elsewhere. Weber, 
Nakṣatra, 2, 362, 400, laid great stress 
on the fact that the Jyotiṣa, 8, referred 
to the difference of the longest and 
shortest day as being six muhūrtas, 
which makes the longest day fourteen 
hours twenty-four minutes: and he 
compared the Babylonian day of four
teen hours twenty-five minutes, and a 
Chinese day of fourteen hours twenty
four minutes. But Whitney, Oriental 
and Linguistic Essays, 2, 417, 418, shows 
that no stress can be laid on this argu
ment, since the correspondence is only 
approximate, and the latitudes of the 
Babylonian and Chinese observations 
are approximately the same. 171) See op. cit., 2, 418-420. 172) Altindisches Leben, 356, 357, where 
he is quite confident of the Semitic 
origin of the Nakṣatras. 173) Op. cit., 572. 174) For the flood, see Zimmer, op. cit., 
101, 357, who is opposed to Weber's 
view (Indische Studien, 1, 160; Indische 
Streifen, 1, 11) that the story preserves 
an old Āryan tradition, and a reminis
cence of the home of the Indians 
beyond the Himālaya (cf. Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 1^2, 190; 2^2, 323, n. 96; Lassen, 
Indische Alterthumskunde, 1^2, 638, and 
cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 276, 
n. 3). For the Ādityas, see Oldenberg, 
Religion des Veda, 185 et seq.; Zeitschrift 
der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell- 
schaft, 50, 43 et seq. His view is not 
accepted by Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 
p. 44; Bloomfield, Religion of the Veda, 
133. Still more doubtful is Zimmer's 
view (Altindisches Leben, 363, 364) of the 
division of day and night into thirty 
parts, which he sees in Rv. i. 123, 8, 
and which he thinks is based on the 
Babylonian division of the same period 
of time into sixtieths. Cf. also V. Smith, 
Indian Antiquary, 34, 230, who argues, 
but inconclusively, that the use of iron 
was introduced from Babylonia. 
The facts about the Nakṣatras are 
(with the exception of the data from the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā and the Baudhā
yana Śrauta Sūtra) collected in Weber's 
second essay, Die vedischen Nachrichten 
von den Naxatra, 1861. The first essay, 
1860, deals with the problem of origins. 
See also his discussions in Indische 
Studien, 9, 424 et seq.; 10, 213 et seq. 
Whitney's work lies partly in his 
scientific determination (in many places 
correcting Colebrooke's discoveries) of 
the later Naxatras in his edition and 
version of the Sūrya Siddhānta (Journal 
of the American Oriental Society, 6), and 
partly in his discussions of the question 
of origin (Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 8), Oriental and Linguistic Essays, 
2, 341-421 (with a stellar chart), and 
of the question of date as against 
Jacobi and Tilak's Orion (Journal of 
the American Oriental Society, 16, lxxxii 
et seq.). The views of Max Müller are 
found in his Rigveda, 4^2, xxxiv et seq. 
The modern discussion of the dates 
inferable from the Nakṣatra was in
augurated by Jacobi (1893) in the 
Festgruss an Roth, 68-74 (translated in 
the Indian Antiquary, 23). See also his 
articles in the Nachrichten der königl. 
Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göt- 
tingen, 1894, 110 et seq.; Zeitschrift der 
Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 
49, 218 et seq.; 50, 70 et seq.; Journal 
of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 721
727. Independently Tilak, in his Orion, 
developed similar views; but most of 
his special points are disposed of by 
Whitney in his review cited above. 
Oldenberg has discussed and refuted 
Jacobi's arguments in the Zeitschrift, 
48, 629 et seq.; 49, 470 et seq.; 50, 450 
et seq.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1909, 1090 et seq. Thibaut has 
also rejected Jacobi's views in an article 
in the Indian Antiquary, 24, 85 et seq. 
See also his Astronomie, Astrologie und 
Mathematik, 17-19. The recent litera
ture on the origin of the Nakṣatras 
consists of articles by Thibaut, Journa 
of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 63, 144 
et seq.; Saussure, Toung Pao, 1909, 
121 et seq.; 255 et seq.; Oldenberg, 
Nachrichten der königl. Gesellschaft der 
Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 544 
et seq. The Nakṣatras in the Epic are 
dealt with by Hopkins, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 24, 29-36. 
Ludwig's views are given in his Trans
lation of the Rigveda, 3, 183 et seq.

नक्षत्रदर्श
नक्षत्र-दर्श
 (‘gazer at the lunar mansions’), an ‘astro
loger,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha, 
or ‘human sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda.
	1 A notice in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 indicates that that work regarded the 
practice of choosing a particular Nakṣatra under which to set 
up the sacrificial fires as an idle one, because it decides in 
favour of choosing the sun as one's Nakṣatra. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 1. 2) ii. 1, 2, 19, and cf. the Kāṇva text 
in Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 
xii, 288, n. 3.

नक्षत्रविद्या
नक्षत्र-विद्या,
 the ‘science of the lunar mansions,’ 
‘astronomy,’ is mentioned with other sciences in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad (vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1).

नख
नख
 denotes either the ‘nail’ of a man,
	1 or the ‘claw’ of 
a wild beast, such as a tiger.
	2 The trimming (nikṛntana)
	3 of 
the nails was a regular part of the toilet of the Vedic Indian, 
especially on occasions of special sanctity, when it accompanied 
the cleansing of the teeth.
	4 1) Rv. i. 162, 9; x. 163, 5; Av. ii. 33, 
6, etc. 2) Rv. iv. 3, 3. Cf. x. 28, 10, of the 
eagle's talon. 3) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 6. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 7; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 6, 2, etc.; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3, 4.

नग
न-ग
 (‘not moving’), ‘mountain,’ is a word occurring only 
in a late book of the Atharvaveda (xix. 8, 1), and then in the 
Sūtras.

नगर
नगर
 is in early Vedic literature found only in the deriva
tive adjective, used as a proper name, Nagarin, but it appears 
in the sense of ‘town’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 11, 18; 
31, 4), and frequently in the later language.

नगरिन्जानश्रुतेय
नगरिन् जान-श्रुतेय
 (‘descendant of Janaśruti’) is men
tioned as a priest in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (v. 30), and as 
Nagarin Jānaśruteya Kāṇḍviya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2).

नग्नजित्
नग्न-जित्,
 King of Gandhāra, is mentioned in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having been consecrated by Parvata and 
Nārada. The same king is mentioned with his son Svarjit 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 where a remark attributed to one 
of them on a ritual topic is treated with contempt. 1) vii. 34. 2) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Weber, Indian 
Literature, 132, 134; Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 1^2, 515.

नग्ना
नग्ना
 See Dharma.

नघमार
नघ-मार
 and Naghā-riṣa. See 1. Kuṣṭha.

नचिकेतस्
न-चिकेतस्
 occurs in the well-known legend of the Taitti
rīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 (where he is a Gotama, the son of Vāja- 
śravasa), and in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad.
	2 His historical reality 
is extremely doubtful: in the Upaniṣad he is called son of 
Āruṇi Auddālaki or Vājaśravasa, an impossible attribution, and 
one due only to a desire to give Naciketas a connexion with 
the famous Āruṇi. 1) iii. 11, 8. 2) i. 1, etc. Cf. Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 3, 154, n, 1; Weber, Indian 
Literature, 157; Macdonell, Vedic Myth- 
ology, p. 168.

नड
1. Naḍa, ‘reed,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as growing in 
lakes, and in the Atharvaveda
	2 is described as vārṣika, ‘pro
duced in the rains.’ Reeds were used, after being split, for 
making mats, a work carried out by women.
	3 They are 
frequently mentioned elsewhere.
	4 See also Nada. 1) viii. 1, 33. 2) iv. 19, 1. 3) Av. vi. 138, 5. 4) Av. vi. 137, 2; xii. 2, 1, 19. 50. 54; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 7; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 19; Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka, vi. 7, 10. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

नडनैषध
2. Naḍa Naiṣadha is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 
where he seems to be
	2 a human king who is compared with 
Yama, the god of death, because of his conquests. Being 
there identified with the southern sacrificial fire, he was pre
sumably a king of the south, just as Yama is connected with 
the south. 1) ii. 2, 2, 1. 2. 2) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 225-227, 
followed by Eggeling, Sacred Books of 
the East, 12, 338, notes 4 and 5. The 
printed text has Naiṣidha by error.

नड्वला
नड्वला,
 a ‘reed bed,’ is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā (xxx. 16) and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 12, 1).

नद
नद
 is found in several passages of the Rigveda,
	1 but its 
sense is still obscure. It is identified by Pischel
	2 with Naḍa, 
being explained by him in one passage
	3 as a reed boat, which 
is split, and over which the waters go; in another
	4 as a reed 
whip, of which the sharp points (karṇa) are used to urge horses 
on; and in others
	5 again as figuratively designating the penis. 
Roth
	6 takes the sense to be ‘bull’ (either literally or meta 
phorically) in all passages. Once at least
	7 the ‘neigher’ (from 
the root nad, ‘sound’) seems to be meant with reference to 
Indra's horse. In the phrase nadasya karṇaiḥ^8 the sense is, 
perhaps, ‘through the ears of the (side) horse’ (that is, by their 
being ready to hear the word of command) of their chariot, 
the Maruts ‘hasten on with their swift steeds’ (turayanta 
āśubhiḥ). 1) i. 32, 8; 179, 4; ii. 34, 3; viii. 69, 2; 
x. 11, 2; 105, 4. Cf. Nirukta, v. 2. 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 717 et seq.; 
Vedische Studien, 1, 183 et seq. 3) i. 32, 8. Here Caland and Henry, 
L'Agniṣṭoma, 312, n., would read naḷam. 
See also Wackernagel, Altindische Gram- 
matik, 1, 173. 4) ii. 34, 3, followed by Max Müller, 
Sacred Books of the East, 32, 301 (who, 
however, does not construe āśubhiḥ, 
‘sharp,’ with karṇaiḥ as Pischel does 
in Vedische Studien, 1, 190). He sees 
‘reed’ also in x. 11, 2, but ‘horse’ in 
x. 105, 4. 5) i. 179, 4; viii. 69, 2. 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. The 
sense of ‘bull’ seems imperative in 
viii. 89, 2; it is admissible in i. 179, 4, 
where ‘bull’ may denote a man, and 
in x. 11, 2, and possibly in i. 32, 8, 
but ‘reed’ there seems far more likely. 7) x. 105, 4. and in x. 11, 2. The 
latter passage suggests that ‘river’ 
may, after all, be the sense there. 
Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 32, 
178, 215.

नदी
नदी,
 ‘stream,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
Reference is made to shallows (gādha)
	3 in the river's bed, to 
the opposite bank (pāra),
	4 and to the bathing of horses in 
streams.
	5 Rivers are also mentioned in close connexion with 
mountains.
	6 The title Nadī-pati, ‘lord of rivers,’
	7 is once 
used to express ‘ocean’ or ‘sea-water.’ 1) i. 158, 5; ii. 35, 3; iii. 33, 4; v. 46, 
6, etc. 2) Av. iii. 13, 1; xiv. 1, 43. 3) Rv. vii. 60, 7. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 6, 6. 5) Rv. viii. 2, 2. 6) Rv. v. 55, 7; x. 64, 8. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 4, 10.

नना
नना
 is a familiar name for mother, parallel with Tata, for 
father, with which it is found in a verse of the Rigveda
	1 
describing the occupations of the parents of the poet. 1) ix. 112, 3. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 6, and see Upala-prakṣiṇī.

ननान्दृ
ननान्दृ
 is a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 
where it denotes, according to Sāyaṇa, the ‘husband's sister,’ 
over whom the wife is to rule. This interpretation is confirmed 
by the fact that the same position is ascribed to the husband's 
sister — no doubt while unmarried and living in her brother's 
care — by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 1) x. 85, 46. 2) iii. 22. 
Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 516. The native 
lexicographers recognize the word, 
though its occurrence in the later 
literature is very rare (it has been 
noted in the Uttararāmacarita). See 
the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

नपात्
नपात्
 in Vedic literature apparently has both the wider 
sense of ‘descendant,’
	1 and the narrower one of ‘grandson’ in 
the Saṃhitās.
	2 In the Brāhmaṇas the word seems hardly to 
have the sense of ‘descendant’ at all, while it denotes not 
only ‘grandson,’
	3 but also ‘great-grandson’ in the sequence 
‘sons, grandsons, great-grandsons’ (putrān, pautrān, naptṝn).
	4 
‘Grandson’ is also expressed by Pautra (‘son's son’) in the 
Atharvaveda and later,
	5 while the sense of ‘great-grandson’ is 
accurately conveyed as early as the Rigveda
	6 by Pra-ṇapāt, 
used beside Napāt, ‘grandson.’ Naptī, the feminine, is practi
cally limited to the Saṃhitās,
	7 and denotes ‘daughter.’ The 
use in the Veda throws no light on the original use of the 
word.
	8 1) It is equivalent to ‘son’ in a 
number of mythological epithets such 
as apāṃ napāt, ‘son of waters.’ 2) Rv. x. 10, 1, clearly ‘son’; vi. 20, 
11, may be ‘grandson.’ Most passages, 
vi. 50, 15; vii. 18, 22; viii. 65, 12; 
102, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 61; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 2, require ‘de
scendant.’ 3) As in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 48; 
putra-naptāraḥ. ‘sons and grandsons.’ 
Cf. Nirukta, viii. 5. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10, 3; 
Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, x. 11, 5. 5) Av. ix. 5, 30; xi. 7, 16; Aitarey 
Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10, 3; Taittirīya Brāh

viii. 2, 42. Cf. i. 50, 9; ix. 9, 1; 14, 5;

 is the name of a Ṛṣi who is referred to in the 
Rigveda
	1 and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.

(Index) attributes to Nābhāka the composition of several hymns 
of the Rigveda (viii. 39-42). 1) viii. 40, 4. 5. 2) vi. 24. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig

नमीसाप्य
नमी साप्य
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda.
	1 Weber
	2 
thinks that he is mentioned as a priest, but the passages suit 
a king better, and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	3 he appears 
as Namī Sāpya, Vaidcho rājā, ‘King of Videha.’ In one 
passage
	4 he is represented as engaged in the contest against 
Namuci. 1) vi. 20, 6; x. 48, 9. Simply Namī

Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34; vi. 27. 32, 
etc. 3) This form of the word, common in 
the post-Vedic language, is secondary, 
having originated from cases like nar- 
am, understood as nara-m; but its origin 
goes back to the Indo-Iranian period.

नराची
नराची
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda,
	1 perhaps meaning 
a poisonous plant. 1) v. 31, 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 286.

नर्य
नर्य
 (‘manly’) is in two passages of the Rigveda (i. 54, 6; 
112, 9) understood by the commentator Sāyaṇa as the proper 
name of a man. See also Nārya.

नलद
नलद,
 ‘nard’ (Nardastachys Jatamansi) is a plant mentioned 
in the Atharvaveda,
	1 in the Aitareya
	2 and the Śāṅkhāyana
	3 
Āraṇyakas (where it is mentioned as used for a garland), as well as 
in the Sūtras. In the Atharvaveda
	4 the feminine form of the word, 
Naladī, occurs as the name of an Apsaras, or celestial nymph. 1) vi. 102, 3. 2) iii. 2, 4. 3) xi. 4. 4) iv. 37, 3.

	1 1) ii. 233 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 18, 38).

नवग्व

 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 as a 
man, an Aṅgiras in the highest degree (Aṅgirastama),
	2 appar
ently being the type of the Navagvas,
	3 who appear as a mystic 
race of olden times, coupled with, and conceived probably as 
related to, the Aṅgirases. They are often associated with the

नवनीत
नव-नीत,
 ‘fresh butter,’ is mentioned frequently in the 
later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 According to the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 this is the kind of butter which is fitted 
for anointing an embryo (garbha), while the gods receive 
Ājya, men fragrant ghee (Ghṛta), and the fathers Āyuta. 
Elsewhere

नववास्त्व
नव-वास्त्व
 appears in three passages of the Rigveda. In 
one
	1 he seems to be a protégé of Agni; in another
	2 as perhaps 
a son of Uśanas and favourite of Indra, but in the last he 
seems to be defeated, or even slain, by Indra.
	3 But he may be 
a mythic figure altogether. Cf. also Bṛhadratha. 1) i. 36, 18. 2) vi. 20, 11. 3) x. 49, 6.

नह्

 has been taken by Roth
	1 and Grassmann
	2 to be the 
stem, meaning ‘bond,’ of the dative form nadbhyas, which 
occurs once in the Rigveda,
	3 and which Sieg
	4 thinks means 
‘sister's sons.’ But the sense of this dative is probably rather 
‘to the grandsons.’

नहुस्
नहुस्
 occurs several times in the Rigveda, but the exact 
sense is not certain. Ludwig
	1 sees in the Nahus a tribe on 
the Sindhu (Indus)
	2 or Sarasvatī,
	3 rich in horses,
	4 allied with 
the Bharatas and Śimyus,
	5 connected with Kakṣīvant and the 
Vārṣāgiras,
	6 and having as kings Maśarśāra and Āyavasa.
	7 
Roth,
	8 on the other hand, sees in Nahus the general sense of 
‘neighbour’ as opposed to a member of one's own people (Viś); 
this interpretation is supported by the occurrence of the phrase 
nahuṣo nahuṣṭara,
	9 ‘closer than a neighbour.’ Nahuṣa has the 
same sense as Nahus in two passages of the Rigveda,
	10 but in 
one it seems to be intended for the proper name of a man.
	11 
Possibly Nahus was originally a man like Manu.

x. 80, 6. 3) Rv. vii. 95, 2. Cf. ix. 88, 2; 91, 2. 4) Rv. viii. 6, 24. 5) Rv. i. 100, 18; vii. 18, 5. 6) Rv. i. 100, 16. 17. 7) Rv. i. 122, 15. Cf. also nahuṣo 
viśaḥ, Rv. vii. 6, 5; x. 49, 8; 99, 7, 
etc. 8) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 9) Rv. x. 49, 8. Cf. also viii. 8, 3. 10) i. 31, 11; v. 12, 6. 11) Rv. viii. 46, 27. 12) Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 
46, 28; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 2, 
324. But Nahus, if it was originally 
the name of a mythic forefather, cannot 
have been that of a forefather recog
nized by all the tribes, for there is no 
passage in which it applies to all men. 
Geldner, Ṛgveda, Glossar, 92, regards 
Nahus as a tribe, Nahuṣa as a king. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 128, leaves 
the question open. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 1^2, 165, n. 7; 179 et seq.; 307 
et seq.

नाक
1. Nāka denotes the ‘firmament’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
It is often used with the epithet ‘highest’ (uttama)
	3 or ‘third’ 
(tṛtīya)
	4 referring to the threefold division of heaven, parallel 
to the threefold division of earth, atmosphere, and sky (Div). 
The Nāka is said to be on the third ridge (pṛṣṭha), above the 
luminous space (rocana) of the sky.
	5 Elsewhere
	6 the series 
earth, atmosphere, sky, and the firmament (nāka), heaven 
(svar), the celestial light (jyotis), occurs. The word nāka 
is explained in the Brāhmaṇas
	7 as derived from na, ‘not,’ 
and aka, ‘pain,’ because those who go there are free from 
sorrow. 1) i. 60, 10; 125, 5; iii. 2, 12; iv. 13, 
5; vii. 86, 1; 99, 2; viii. 103, 2;

नाक
2. Nāka is the name of a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Presumably he is identical with Nāka Maudgalya 
(‘descendant of Mudgala’), who is mentioned in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	3 and the Taittirīya 
Upaniṣad.
	4 1) iii. 13, 5. 2) xii. 5, 2, 1. 3) vi. 4, 4. 4) i. 9, 1.

नाक्र
नाक्र
 is the name of an aquatic animal included among the 
victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās.
	1 Perhaps the animal meant is the crocodile, which 
later is called Nakra.

नाग
नाग
 appears once in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 in the form 
mahānāga, where ‘great snake’ or ‘great elephant’ may be 
meant. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	2 and in a citation 
found in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 the sense of ‘elephant’ is 
clearly intended. In the Sūtras
	4 the mythic Nāga already 
occurs. 1) xi. 2, 7, 12. 2) i. 3, 24. 3) viii. 22. 4) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 1. 
Cf. Winternitz, Sarpabali, 43; Mac. 
donell, Vedic Mythology, p. 153.

नाग्नजित
नाग्न-जित,
 ‘descendant of Nagnajit,’ is the patronymic of 
Svarjit in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (viii. 1, 4, 10).

नाचिकेत
नाचिकेत,
 ‘connected with Naciketas,’ is the title of a 
narrative (upākhyāna) in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad.
	1 The word 
is also applied as an epithet to a special fire in that Upaniṣad
	2 
and in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad.
	3 1) iii. 16. 2) i. 18; ii. 10. 3) i. 22, 11; 26, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische 
Studien, 3, 386. The native lexicog
raphers give Nāchiketa and Nāciketu 
as synonyms of fire generally.

नाडपित्
नाड-पित्
 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the birth
place of Bharata. The word may, however, be read as 
Nāḍa-pitī, the name of Bharata's mother,
	2 but this is less 
probable. 1) xiii. 5, 4, 13. 2) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 
6, n. 3. 
Cf. Leumann, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 81.

नाडी
1. Nāḍī denotes a ‘vein’ or ‘artery’ in the human body in 
the Atharvaveda
	1 and later,
	2 a natural extension of the literal 
sense of ‘reed.’ 1) vi. 138, 4; x. 7, 15. 16. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 5, 2; Bṛhad

3, etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 6, 1; 
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv. 19.

नाडी
2. Nāḍī means a musical instrument, a ‘reed flute,’ in the 
Rigveda
	1 as well as the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	2 where in one 
passage it is mentioned along with the Tūṇava.
	3 1) x. 135, 7. 2) xxiii. 4; xxxiv. 5. 3) xxxiv. 5. 
Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 329.

नाडी
3. Nāḍī in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 seems to mean the box 
of the chariot wheel. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 12.

नाडीका
नाडीका
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where the sense 
seems clearly to be ‘wind-pipe,’ with a reference also to the 
‘shaft of an arrow’ made of reed. 1) v. 18, 8. Cf. Weber, Indische 
Studien, 18, 229; Whitney, Translation 
of the Atharvaveda, 251; Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 432.

नाथ
नाथ
 in Vedic literature
	1 appears only as a neuter meaning 
‘protection,’ and is of rare occurrence.
	2 Generally, too, very 
little appears in Vedic literature of practices such as those 
which produced Anglo-Saxon society or the Roman patronatus. 1) Av. iv. 20, 9; ix. 2, 17; xviii. 1, 
13; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 1. 
Also in Av. xiii. 2, 37, nātha-kāma, 
‘seeking help’; xi, 1, 15, nātha-vid, 
‘finding help’; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 
xiv. 11, 23, nātha-vindu, ‘procuring 
protection,’ as the name of a Sāman, 
or chant. 2) In the post-Vedic literature, on the 
other hand, the word is a masculine, 
meaning ‘protector,’ and is very com
mon.

नापित
नापित,
 ‘barber,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 
and later.
	2 But the older word is Vaptṛ,
	3 a derivative of 
vap, ‘shave,’ with forms of which verb shaving is referred to 
as early as the Rigveda.
	4 The dead were shaved before 
burial.
	5 1) iii. 1, 2, 2. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 2, 8. 
13; Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 17, 
etc. 3) Rv. x. 142, 4. 4) x. 142, 4. Cf. i. 65, 4; Av. vi. 68; 
v 2, 17, etc. 5) Av. v. 19, 4. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 266; 
Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 
32, 265.

नाभाक
नाभाक,
 ‘descendant of Nabhāka,’ is the name of a Ṛṣi, 
or seer, in the Rigveda.
	1 The Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes 
three or four hymns of the Rigveda
	2 to him. According to 
Ludwig,
	3 the man was an Āṅgirasa,
	4 not a Kaṇva. 1) viii. 41, 2; Nirukta, x. 5. 2) viii. 39-41, and doubtfully 42. 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107. 4) viii. 40, 12.

नाभानेदिष्ठ
नाभा-नेदिष्ठ
 (‘nearest in descent’) Mānava (‘descendant 
of Manu’) is famous in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas
	1 
for the way in which he was treated when his father Manu 
divided his property among his sons, or they divided it: 
Nābhānediṣṭha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining, 
through his father's advice, cows from the Aṅgirases, a feat 
which is regarded in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 as on a 
level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their 
patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62. 
Nābhānediṣṭha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Brāh
maṇas,
	3 but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him. 
In the Saṃhitā
	4 itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in 
one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning. 
Nābhānediṣṭha is etymologically connected in all probability 
with Nabānazdiṣta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravaṣi 
of the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha and the Fravaṣi of the Nabānazdiṣta. 
Lassen
	5 saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian 
split; but Roth
	6 showed conclusively that this was impossible, 
and that Nābhānediṣṭha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and 
Weber
	7 admits that the connexion of the words is not one of 
borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its 
original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has 
become a proper name. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 1. 9. 4-6; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 14. Cf. Muir, 
Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 191 et seq. 2) xvi. 11. 28-30. 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 4, 
merely refers to him as connected with 
the Aṅgirases. See also ibid., xxx. 4; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 30. 31; Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xx. 9, 4. 4) x. 61, 18. 5) Indische Alterthumskunde, 1, 520, and 
Addenda, p. lxxvii. 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 6, 243 et seq. 7) Episches im vedischen Ritual, 40-50. Cf. also Dāya.

नाभि
1. Nābhi develops from the literal sense of ‘navel’ the 
figurative meaning of ‘relationship,’
	1 or, concretely, ‘relation.’
	2 1) i. 105, 9; 164, 33; ii. 3, 9; 40, 4, 
etc.; Av. xii. 1, 40; Vājasaneyi Saṃ

saneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 42-44. 50, etc.

नाभि
2. Nābhi, ‘nave’ of a chariot wheel, is mentioned in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 See also Ratha, and cf. Nabhya. 1) v. 43, 8; vi. 39, 4; viii. 41, 6. 2) Av. iii. 30, 6; x. 8, 34; xi. 7, 4;

iii. 2, 4; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 8.

नामधेय
नाम-धेय,
 ‘name,’ is found in the Rigveda,
	1 and often in 
the later language.
	2 See Nāman. 1) x. 71, 1. 2) Av. vii. 109, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
ii. 4, 9, 3; iii. 3, 4, 1; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 1, 6, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad, ii. 3, 11; vi. 4, 25; Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 4; Aitareya Upaniṣad, 
v. 2, etc.

नामन्
नामन्,
 ‘name,’ is a common word from the Rigveda 
onwards. The Gṛhya Sūtras
	1 give elaborate rules for the 
formation of the names of children, but more important is 
the distinction between the secret (guhya) and the ordinary 
name, though the rules as to the secret name are not at all 
consistent. The secret name is already recognized in the 
Rigveda,
	2 and is referred to in the Brāhmaṇas,
	3 one secret 
name, that of Arjuna for Indra, being given in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.
	4 It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the 
designation of a Nakṣatra (lunar asterism) as the secret name 
or otherwise is not illustrated by a single recorded name of a 
teacher in the Brāhmaṇas.
	5 
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	6 several times mentions the 
adoption of a second name with a view to securing success, 
and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes 
of distinction.
	7 
In actual practice two names are usually found in the 
Brāhmaṇas, the second being a patronymic or a metronymic, 
as in Kakṣīvant Auśija
	8 (if the story of the slave woman Uśij 
as his mother is correct), or Bṛhaduktha Vāmneya,
	9 ‘son of 
Vāmnī,’ though the relationship may, of course, be not direct 
parentage, but more remote descent.
	10 Three names are less 
common — for example, Kūśāmba Svāyava Lātavya,
	11 ‘son of 
Svāyu, of the Lātavya (son of Latu) family,’ or Devataras 
Śyāvasāyana Kāśyapa,
	12 where the patronymic and the Gotra 
name are both found. In other cases the names probably 
have a local reference — e.g., Kauśāmbeya and Gāṅgya. Fre
quently the patronymic only is given, as Bhārgava, Maudgalya, 
etc., or two patronymics are used. The simple name is often 
used for the patronymic — e.g., Trasadasyu.
	13 In a few cases 
the name of the wife is formed from the husband's name,
	14 as 
Uśīnarāṇī, Purukutsānī, Mudgalānī. 1) Weber, Naxatra, 2, 316 et seq.;

नाम्ब
नाम्ब
 is the name of a kind of grain mentioned in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	2 and the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	3 1) v. 3, 3, 8. 2) i. 8, 10, 1. 3) xv. 15.

नाय
नाय
 in two passages of the Rigveda
	1 is, according to the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, probably a proper name. Sāyaṇa 
takes the word to mean ‘leader,’ while Pischel
	2 considers it 
a gerund with passive sense. 1) vi. 24, 10; 46, 11. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 41. For other 
explanations, see Oldenberg, Ṛgveda- 
Noten, 1, 123, 370.

नारद
नारद
 is the name of a mythical seer mentioned several 
times in the Atharvaveda.
	1 In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa he 
appears in conjunction with Parvata as priest of Hariścandra,
	2 
as teaching Somaka Sāhadevya,
	3 and as anointing Āmbāṣṭhya 
and Yudhāṃśrauṣṭi.
	4 In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	5 he is 
mentioned as a teacher, and in the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa
	6 
as a pupil of Bṛhaspati. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	7 he is 
coupled with Sanatkumāra. 1) v. 19, 9; xii. 4, 16. 24. 41. 2) vii. 13. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, xv. 17. 3) vii. 34. 4) viii. 21. 5) i. 5, 8. 6) iii. 9 (the Vaṃśa, or ‘list of 
teachers,’ at the end). 7) vii. 1, 1. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 204, n.

नाराशंसी
नाराशंसी
 (scil. Ṛc), ‘(verse) celebrating men,’ is mentioned 
as early as the Rigveda,
	1 and is distinguished from Gāthā in 
a number of passages in the later literature.
	2 The Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā,
	3 while distinguishing the two, asserts that both are 
false (anṛtam). It is hardly probable that the two were abso
lutely distinct, for the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	4 has the phrase 
‘a Gāthā celebrating men’ (nārāśaṃsī). What such verses 
were may be seen from the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	5 which 
enumerates the Nārāśaṃsāni at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human 
sacrifice.’ They may legitimately be reckoned as a source of 
the epic.
	6 
The term Nārāśaṃsī is restricted in some passages
	7 to a 
particular group of three verses of the Atharvaveda,
	8 but 
Oldenberg
	9 must be right in holding that the restricted sense 
is not to be read into the Rigveda.
	10 Not even in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	11 is the technical sense certain, and the Bṛhaddevatā
	12 
gives the word a general application. 1) x. 85, 6. 2) Av. xv. 6, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

Atharvaveda, 100 (cf. Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 688, 689), lays stress rather on 
their character as mere eulogies of 
donors, and that, no doubt, was one 
of their sides; but the other elements 
may have been more prominent in 
reality than the priestly tradition 
shows. 7) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 32; Kauṣī

the other passages mentioned in note 2,

likely. 8) xx. 127, 1-3 = Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta

नारी
नारी,
 ‘woman,’ occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 The 
word seems in the Rigveda
	3 to have a distinct reference to a 
woman as a wife, because it occurs in several passages with 
distinct reference to matrimonial relations,
	3 and in the later 
Vedic literature, where it is not common, it sometimes
	4 has 
that sense. Delbrück,
	5 however, thinks that it does not indi
cate marital relations, but merely the woman as the sexual 
complement of the man. 1) vii. 20, 5; 55, 8; viii. 77, 8; 
x. 18, 7; 86, 10. 11. 2) Av. xiv. 2, 13; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,

husband’); vii. 20. 5; x. 18, 7 (avidhavāḥ 
supatnīḥ, ‘not widowed, with noble 
husbands’), etc. 3) i. 73, 3 (pati-juṣṭā, ‘dear to her 
husband’); vii. 20. 5; x. 18, 7 (avidhavāḥ 
supatnīḥ, ‘not widowed, with noble 
husbands’), etc. 4) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, ix. 28. 5) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschafts- 
namen, 417, 439.

नार्मर
नार्मर
 occurs once in a corrupt verse of the Rigveda.
	1 
Ludwig
	2 regards the word as the proper name of the prince 
of a fort, Ūrjayantī, but Roth
	3 as that of a demon. 1) ii. 13, 8. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

नार्मिणी
नार्मिणी
 is found in the Rigveda
	1 as an epithet of Pur, ‘fort’: 
it must apparently either be a proper name of the fort,
	2 or 
mean ‘belonging to Narmin or Narmiṇa,’ some prince.
	3 1) i. 149, 3. 2) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 204. 3) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v. Possibly the expression may con
sist of two words — na, ‘not’ or ‘like,’ 
and armiṇī, whatever that may mean. 
See Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 148; 
Sacred Books of the East, 46, 177.

नार्य
नार्य,
 ‘descendant of Narya,’ is the name of a generous 
donor in the Rigveda.
	1 1) viii. 24, 29. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161, 162.

नार्षद
नार्षद,
 ‘descendant of Nṛṣad,’ is the patronymic of Kaṇva 
(i.e., a descendant of Kaṇva) in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and in one 
passage of the Rigveda,
	2 where probably the same man is 
referred to in another passage
	3 as a protégé of the Aśvins, and 
perhaps as the husband of Ruśatī. But in a third passage of 
the Rigveda
	4 the name seems applied to a demon, though this 
is not certain. 1) iv. 19, 2. 2) x. 31, 11. 3) i. 117, 8. 4) x. 61, 13. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 108, 150; Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 397.

नावप्रभ्रंशन
नाव-प्रभ्रंशन,
 the ‘sliding down of the ship,’ is read 
in Whitney and Roth's text of the Atharvaveda,
	1 and has been 
connected by Weber
	2 and others
	3 with Manor Avasarpaṇa, the 
name in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	4 of the northern mountain 
on which Manu's ship settled on the subsidence of the deluge. 
But both Bloomfield
	5 and Whitney
	6 point out that this inter
pretation is highly improbable, and this view is accepted by 
Macdonell.
	7 The expression is analyzed as na ava-prabhraṃśana 
by the Pada text and the commentator alike, and is never found 
elsewhere with reference to the descent of a boat or ship.
	8 1) xix. 39, 8, where the reading nāva- 
prabhráṃśana is a conjectural emendā
tion, the manuscripts of the Saṃhitā 
text all having two accents, nāvapra- 
bhráṃśana (one of them reading nāvaḥ-). 2) Indische Streifen, 1, 11. 3) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 198; Eggeling, Sacred Books 
of the East, 12, 218, n.; Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 30. 4) i. 8, 1, 6. 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 679. 6) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
961. 7) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 
1907, 1107, where his acceptance of 
Weber's interpretation in his Sanskrit 
Literature, 144, is withdrawn. 8) The word nau, ship, never occurs 
as the first member of a compound in 
the form of nāva, while pra-bhraṃś, 
‘fall down,’ is never used of the 
gliding down of a boat, and would be 
inappropriately applied in that sense.

नावा
नावा,
 ‘ship,’ occurs once in the Rigveda (i. 97, 8). See 
Nau.

नावाज
नावाज
 (‘ship-propeller’), a ‘boatman,’ is mentioned in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 3, 3, 5).

नाव्या
नाव्या
 is found several times in the Rigveda
	1 and the later 
literature
	2 in the sense of a ‘navigable stream.’ 1) i. 33, 11; 80, 8; 121, 13. 2) Av. viii. 5, 9; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xxiii. 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 4, 
14, etc.

नाहुष
नाहुष,
 like Nahus, means, according to the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, in some passages of the Rigveda
	1 ‘neighbouring’ 
as an adjective, and once
	2 as a substantive ‘neighbour.’ If, 
on the other hand, Nahus is taken as a proper name, then 
Nāhuṣa no doubt denotes ‘belonging to the Nahus people,’ 
and, as a substantive, ‘King of the Nahus.’ 1) i. 100, 16; v. 73, 3; vi. 22, 10; viii. 6, 24. 2) viii. 95, 2.

निकोथकभायजात्य
निकोथक भाय-जात्य
 (‘descendant of Bhayajāta’) is 
mentioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a pupil of Pratithi. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 444.

निगदपार्णवल्कि
निगद पार्ण-वल्कि
 (‘descendant of Parṇavalka’) is men
tioned in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a pupil of Giriśarman. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. Cf. Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443.

निगुत्
नि-गुत्
 occurs in two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 where Sāyaṇa 
takes it to mean ‘enemy,’ a possible interpretation. Ludwig
	2 
suggests that non-Āryan foes are meant. 1) ix. 97, 53, 54; x. 128, 6. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 164.

निगुस्थ
निगुस्थ
 is a term of unknown meaning applied in the 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 29, 6) to the peoples of Kāśi, 
Videha, and Kosala.

नितत्नी
1. Ni-tatnī, ‘striking downwards,’ occurs in the Atharvaveda
	1 
as the name of an unknown plant which was used as a means 
of restoring the hair. 1) vi. 136; probably 137 also refers 
to this plant. Cf. Kauṣītaki Sūtra, 
xxxi. 28, with Caland's note in his 
translation; Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 
61; Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 536, 537; 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 383.

नितत्नी
2. Ni-tatnī is the name of one of the seven Kṛttikās in the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 1, 4, 1). See Nakṣatra.

नितानमारुत
नि-तान मारुत
 is the name of a man in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā (xxv. 10).

निदाघ
नि-दाघ
 (‘burning down’), ‘summer,’ is the name of one 
of the seasons in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 8, 1, 4). See 
Naidāgha.

निदान
नि-दान
 is the name of a Sūtra, which is referred to in the 
Bṛhaddevatā
	1 apparently as containing a quotation from the 
Bhāllavi Brāhmaṇa. The quotation cannot be verified in 
the existing text of the Sūtra.
	2 1) v. 23, with Macdonell's note. 2) Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 
65. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 44; 
Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 
111, etc.

निधा
नि-धा,
 ‘net,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) ix. 83, 4; x. 73, 11; Nirukta, iv. 2. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 19.

निधि
नि-धि
 means primarily ‘(place of) deposit,’ ‘store,’
	1 and then 
‘treasure’ generally.
	2 In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	3 Nidhi 
denotes some sort of science. 1) Rv. i. 183, 4; v. 43, 8; vii. 67, 7; 
69, 3, etc. 2) Rv. ii. 24, 6; viii. 29, 6; x. 68, 6; 
Av. x. 7, 23, etc. 3) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. The 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and 
Böhṭlingk in his edition, take daivo 
nidhiḥ as one expression. See Daiva. 
Sāyaṇa takes each as a separate entity, 
and renders Nidhi as mahākālādinidhi- 
śāstram, presumably meaning some sort 
of chronology. 
Cf. for Nidhi as ‘treasure,’ Jolly, 
Recht und Sitte, 103, 104.

निनाह्य
नि-नाह्य
 denotes in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 9, 2, 8) 
a ‘water jar,’ so called, according to the commentator, because 
it was buried in the ground.
	1 Eggeling
	2 explains it as ‘a 
vessel or cistern dug into the ground for keeping water cool.’ 1) As meaning etymologically ‘to be 
fastened or fixed down.’ 2) Sacred Books of the East, 26, 223, 
n. 4.

निन्दिताश्व
निन्दिताश्व
 (‘possessing contemptible steeds’) is the name of 
a patron in the Rigveda.
	1 The name may suggest connexion 
with Iran, but such a reference is not at all necessary.
	2 
Sāyaṇa ingeniously turns the name — probably a nickname — 
into a compliment by rendering it ‘one who puts to shame the 
horses of his rivals.’ 1) viii. 1, 30. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 17, 90. Cf. Ludwing, 
Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159.

निपाद
नि-पाद
 in the Rigveda (v. 83, 7) denotes ‘low ground,’. 
‘valley,’ as opposed to ‘hill’ (udvat). Cf. Nivat.

निम्रुच्
नि-म्रुच्,
 ‘sunset,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and later
	2 as a division of time. 1) i. 151, 5; 161, 10; viii. 27, 19; 
x. 151, 5. 2) Av. xiii. 3, 21; Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, i. 5, 10, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xxxvii. 10; Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 5, 
2, etc.

निरष्ट
निर्-अष्ट,
 ‘castrated,’ is found in some of the later Saṃhitās
	1 
as applied to oxen, and in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 to horses. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1; 17, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4. 9. 2) xiii. 4, 2, 5.

निराल
निर्-आल
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where Sāyaṇa 
regards it as the name of a disease. Bloomfield,
	2 with the 
Padapāṭha, explains it as two words, understanding nir as an 
elliptical imperative, ‘(go) out,’ with the vocative āla, a kind 
of weed. Whitney
	3 at first took āla to be a verbal form, but 
finally came to the conclusion that the expression is one word, 
nirāla, of unknown sense. 1) vi. 16, 3. 2) Hymns of the Atharvavéda, 466. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
292.

निरुक्त
निरुक्त,
 ‘explanation’ of a word or passage, is found in the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad (viii. 3, 3), but does not appear as the 
name of a work before the later Upaniṣads. It is, however, 
probable that Yāska's Nirukta is not later than the rise of 
Buddhism. Cf. Nirvacana. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 13, 
17; 3, 260 et seq.; Indian Literature, 25, 
26, 41, 42, etc.; Macdonell, Sanskrit 
Literature, 269, 270; Keith, Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka, 24, 25; Roth, Nirukta, xv. 
et seq.

निर्यास
निर्-यास
 denotes the ‘exudation’ of trees. In the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 5, 4) it is tabooed as food because of its red 
colour.

निर्वचन
निर्-वचन
 in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	1 and the Nirukta
	2 
means ‘explanation,’ especially etymological. Cf. Nirukta. 1) i. 6, 3. 2) ii. 1. Cf. a-nirvacanam, ‘not 
serving as an explanation,’ ibid., 
vii. 24.

निवत्
नि-वत्
 denotes ‘valley’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) i. 161, 11; iii. 2, 10; vii. 50, 4; 
x. 127, 2; 142, 4. 2) Av. vi. 22, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
iii. 2, 4; 4, etc.

निवान्यवत्सा
निवान्य-वत्सा
 and Nivānyā in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 
denotes a ‘cow with a calf to which she has to be won over,’ 
that is, with a calf substituted for one of her own which has died. 
Nivānyā
	2 is a contracted form of the compound term. Similar 
expressions are abhivānya-vatsā,
	3 abhivānyā,
	4 vānyā,
	5 and api- 
vānya-vatsā.
	6 1) xii. 5, 1, 4. 2) ii. 6, 1, 6. 3) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 2. 4) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 8, 4. 5) Ibid., ii. 6, 16, 2. 6) Kauśika Sūtra, lxxxii. 22. 
Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Translation 
of the Atharvaveda, 880.

निविद्
नि-विद्
 denotes a brief invocation of the deity that is invited 
in a liturgy in honour of the god. The Brāhmaṇas
	1 repeatedly 
mention Nivids as inserted in the Śastras (recitations), and the 
Khilas of the Rigveda
	2 preserve among them a set of Nivids. 
But it is doubtful
	3 whether the habit of using such brief 
formulas — the Nivid is usually not more than a Pada or 
quarter-verse in length — is known to the Rigveda, though it 
has been seen even there,
	4 and the word Nivid is several times 
found in that Saṃhitā,
	5 but hardly in the technical sense of 
the Brāhmaṇas. In the later Saṃhitās
	6 the technical sense is 
common. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 33. 34; 
iii. 10. 11; vi. 33. 35; Kauṣītaki Brāh
maṇa, xiv. 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 9, 3, 28; xiii. 5, 1. 9, etc.; Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka, i. 5, 2; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇ
yaka, i. 3, etc. 2) See Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen 
des Ṛgveda, 137-143. 3) The antiquity of the Nivids was 
asserted by Haug, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
1, 26 et seq., and often since, e.g., by 
Tilak, Orion, 206; Scheftelowitz, op. cit., 
3. It is shown to be most improbable 
by Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 265, 355, 
and Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 242 
et seq.; Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 
1907, 232, 233. 4) i. 86, 4; Bezzenberger's Beiträge, 
9, 192. So Oldenberg, Sacred Books of 
the East, 46, 119, 122, takes Rv. i. 96, 
2, to refer to the Nivids in the technical 
sense, but not to the Nivids as pre
served. 5) i. 89, 3; 96, 2; 175, 6; ii. 36, 6; 
iv. 18, 7; vi. 67, 10. 6) Av. v. 26, 4; xi. 7, 19; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xix, 25, etc. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 102; 
Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 387, n. 2; 
Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 241.

निविद्धान
निविद्-धान,
 ‘containing a Nivid,’ is found several times as 
an epithet of a hymn or verse in the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17; Kauṣī
aki Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 6; xxiv. 4; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 1, 12; Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka, i. 2, 2; 5, 3.

निवेशन
नि-वेशन,
 ‘dwelling,’ occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and the Sūtras. 
In the latter
	2 the word is sometimes contrasted with Gṛha as 
the resting-place of animals. 1) iv. 19, 9; vii. 19, 5. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 6, etc.

निषङ्गथि
नि-षङ्गथि
 
	1 or Niṣaṅga-dhi
	2 is found in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās. If the second form of the word is correct, the sense 
may be ‘sheath of a sword’ (niṣaṅga), as it is taken by the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, but probably the first form is the 
correct one, the word then having the same meaning as 
Niṣaṅgin. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 11; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 2. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 10.

निषङ्गिन्
नि-षङ्गिन्
 is found three times in the Rigveda,
	1 where, 
owing to its following in one passage
	2 the words sudhanvāna 
iṣumanto, ‘having good bows and arrows,’ the sense of 
niṣaṅginaḥ as ‘having quivers’ seems quite certain. In the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	3 it is taken by the commentator Mahīdhara 
to mean ‘having a sword,’ a sense which is quite possible both 
there and in the other passages
	4 where it occurs. But the 
word far more probably means ‘having a quiver,’ for the bow 
was the Vedic weapon, not the sword (Asi). 1) iii. 30, 15; v. 57, 2; x. 103, 3. 2) v. 57, 2. 3) xvi. 20. Cf. Kātyāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, xx, 2, 11, with the commentator. 4) Sāmaveda, ii. 1199; Kāṭhaka Saṃ
hitā, xvii. 12; xxxvii. 11; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
iv. 5, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
xiii. 4, 2, 5. 
Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 274.

निषाद
नि-षाद
 is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 
The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but 
to be the general term for the non-Āryan tribes who were not 
under Āryan control, as the Śūdras were, for Aupamanyava
	2 
took the five peoples (pañca janāḥ) to be the four castes (catvāro 
varṇāḥ) and the Niṣādas, and the commentator Mahīdhara 
explains the word where it occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	3 
as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhīl. A village of Niṣādas is men
tioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	4 and a Niṣāda Sthapati, 
a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	5 and in a Brāhmaṇa cited by the scholiast on that 
passage. Weber
	6 thinks that the Niṣādas were the settled 
aborigines (form ni, ‘down,’ and sad, ‘settle’), a view sup
ported by the fact that the ritual of the Viśvajit sacrifice
	7 
requires a temporary residence with Niṣādas; for the Niṣādas 
who would permit an Āryan to reside temporarily amongst 
them must have been partially amenable to Āryan influence. 
But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of 
aborigines outside the Āryan organization. Von Schroeder
	8 
thinks that the Niṣādas were most probably identical with the 
Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an 
embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the 
Aśvakas, but this identification is doubtful. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 2; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xvi. 27; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 11; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 6, 8, etc. 2) In Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 8. 3) xvi. 27. Cf. xxx. 8. 4) viii. 2, 8. 5) i. 1, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, 
10, 13. 6) Indische Studien, 9, 340. Cf. 10, 13, 
16. 7) See Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 15; 
Lāṭyāyana, loc. cit.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa, loc. cit. 8) Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 366. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 39, 
119. In the later system (Manu, x. 8) 
the Niṣāda is the offspring of a Brāh
maṇa and of a Śūdra woman, while the 
Bṛhatsaṃhitā of Varāhamihira (xiv. 10) 
recognizes a kingdom (rāṣṭra) of Niṣādas 
in the south-east of Madhyadeśa. In the 
Pāli texts (Fick, Die sociale Gliederung, 
12, 160, 206 et seq.) they are wild 
hunters and fishers. Cf. also Muir, 
Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 301, 303, 366, n. 164, 
403, 481.

निष्क
निष्क
 is frequently found in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denoting 
a gold ornament worn on the neck, as is shown by the two 
epithets niṣka-kaṇṭha
	3 and niṣka-grīva,
	4 ‘having a gold ornament 
on the neck.’ A Niṣka of silver is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	5 As early as the Rigveda
	6 traces are seen of the 
use of Niṣkas as a sort of currency, for a singer celebrates the 
receipt of a hundred Niṣkas and a hundred steeds: he could 
hardly require the Niṣkas merely for purposes of personal 
adornment. Later the use of Niṣkas as currency is quite clear.

निष्किरीय
निष्किरीय
 is the name of a school of priests who are men
tioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as holding a Sattra, or 
‘sacrificial session.’ 1) xii. 5, 14. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 58.

निष्ट्य
निष्ट्य
 means in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 an outsider or 
stranger. Hence the constellation usually known as Svāti 
(see Nakṣatra) is named Niṣṭyā in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 
because it occupies a position markedly away from the ecliptic. 1) vi. 75, 19; viii. 1, 13; x. 133, 5. 2) Av. iii. 3, 6; Vājasaneyi, v. 23;

Cf. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the 
East, 32, 215.

निहाका
निहाका
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	2 appears 
to denote some phenomenon of a storm, perhaps the ‘whirl
wind.’ 1) x. 97, 13. 2) vii. 5, 11, 1 (following nīhāra).

नीक्षण
नीक्षण
 See Nekṣaṇa.

नीच्य
नीच्य
 (‘living below’) is a designation of certain nations of 
the west. The Nīcyas are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 
(viii. 14) as distinguished from the people of Madhyadeśa, and 
no doubt mean the inhabitants of the Indus and Panjab 
regions.

नीथ
नीथ
 (‘leading’), neut., means musical ‘mode’ and then 
‘hymn of praise.’
	1 The feminine form Nīthā occurs once in 
the Rigveda
	2 meaning ‘artifice.’ 1) Rv. iv. 3, 16; vii. 26, 2; x. 92, 3; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 38. Cf. nīthāvid 
of singers (jaritṛ) in Rv. iii. 12, 5. 2) i. 104, 5. Cf. the epithet śata-nītha, 
i. 100, 12; 179, 3; x. 69, 7; sahasra- 
nītha, iii. 60, 7; ix. 85, 4; 96, 18 (used 
of the poet's art, padavīḥ kavīnām). 
Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 241.

नीनाह
नीनाह,
 a word occurring once in the Atharvaveda (xix. 57, 4), 
seems to denote a ‘girdle’ or something similar, as derived 
from the verb nah, ‘fasten.’

नीपातिथि
नीपातिथि
 occurs in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of a man to 
whom a hymn
	2 is ascribed by the Anukramaṇī (Index). A 
Sāman, or Chant, of his is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	3 1) viii. 49, 9, where he appears as 
engaged in battle; viii. 51, 1, where 
he seems to be a sacrificer. Either a 
king or a seer may be meant. 2) viii. 34. Cf. Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 140; Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society,

sālā, is the name, according to the commentator, of a grain
creeper in the Atharvaveda.

apron of cloth, worn by both men and women, but especially 
by the latter. It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) viii. 2, 16; xiv. 2, 50. Cf. nīvi-

नृ
नृ
 See Nara.

नृति
नृति
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 seems to mean a 
bag of skin. But though the Paippalāda recension has the 
same text, it is clear that we must read Dṛti with Roth
	2 and 
Whitney.
	3 Ludwig
	4 renders the word ‘dancer,’ which makes 
no sense in the context. 1) vi. 18, 3. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
294. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 
235; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 468. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 514.

नृतू
नृतू
 occurs once in the Rigveda
	1 denoting a female ‘dancer.’ 
In another passage
	2 Nṛti is found coupled with hāsa, ‘laughter,’ 
in the description of the funeral ritual; but though it is clear 
that a joyful celebration is meant (like the Irish ‘wake’ or the 
old-fashioned feasting in Scotland after a funeral), it is difficult 
to be certain that actual dancing is here meant. Dancing is, 
however, often referred to in the Rigveda
	3 and later. Nṛtta
gīta, ‘dance and song,’ are mentioned in the Jaiminīya 
Brāhmaṇa
	4 as found in the sixth world. See also Śailūṣa. 1) i. 92, 4 (where Uṣas, Goddess of Dawn, is compared to a dancer). 2) x. 18, 3. Cf. 29, 2. 3) i. 10, 1; 92, 4, etc. See Weber, 
Indian Literature, 196 et seq. 4) i. 42 (Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 235).

 ‘lord of men,’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes 
a ‘king’ or a man of the ruling class (Kṣatriya). 1) ii. 1, 1. 7; iv. 20, 1; vii. 69, 1; 
x. 44, 2. 3. 2) Av. v. 18, 1. 15; Taittirīya Āraṇ
yaka, vi. 3, 3; x. 77, etc.

नृमेध
नृ-मेध,
 
	1 Nṛ-medhas,
	2 is the name of a protégé of Agni 
in the Rigveda,
	3 where he also appears with Sumedhas in a 
hymn that Griffith
	4 with justice declares to be unintelligible. 
In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 he is an unsuccessful rival of 
Parucchepa, and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 he is an 
Āṅgirasa and a seer of Sāmans (Chants). 1) Rv. x. 80, 3; 132, 7; Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 3. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 8, 21

Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 8, 3. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, viii. 8, 21 
et seq.

नृषद्
नृ-षद्,
 ‘sitting among men,’ is the name of the father of 
Kaṇva in the Rigveda (x. 31, 11). Cf. Nārṣada.

नेक्षण
नेक्षण
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where a ‘spit’ 
seems to be meant. In the Rigveda
	2 Nīkṣaṇa occurs, and 
must have the same sense; Oldenberg
	3 inclines to think that 
this word refers to the ‘inspection’ of food, to see if it is 
ready (as from ni-īkṣ, ‘look into’). 1) ix. 6, 17. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, ii. 11; 
lxxxvii. 12; Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 540. 2) i. 162, 13. 3) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 155.

नेमि
नेमि
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 the ‘felly’ of a 
chariot wheel. It was required to be of good wood (su-drū),
	3 
and was bent into shape.
	4 Cf. Ratha. 1) i. 32, 15; 141, 9; ii. 5, 3; v. 13, 6; 
vii. 32, 20; viii. 46, 23; 75, 5, etc. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 15;

नेष्टृ,
 the name of one of the chief priests at the Soma 
sacrifice, occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 See Ṛtvij. 1) i. 15, 3; ii. 5, 5, etc. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 18, 1;

maṇa, xxv. 15, etc. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 
1, 250, 261, 527.

नैचाशाख
नैचा-शाख
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
Sāyaṇa renders it as ‘of low origin,’ but elsewhere
	2 he explains 
it as the name of a place. The former sense is accepted by 
Grassmann and Ludwig in their versions, and by Zimmer,
	3 
but Hillebrandt
	4 points out that the reference is rather to the 
‘low-branched’ Soma plant. Cf. Kīkaṭa and Pramaganda. 1) vii. 53, 4. 2) See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 31. 4) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18; 2, 241
245, where he opposes Böhtlingk's view 
that it is a proper name.

नैचुदार
नैचु-दार
 occurs in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 meaning 
‘composed of the wood of the Nicudāra.’ What tree is meant 
by the latter name is unknown. 1) xxi. 4, 13. Cf. Anupada Sūtra, vi. 4.

नैतन्धव
नैतन्धव
 is mentioned as a place on the Sarasvatī in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Sūtras.
	2 1) xxv. 13, 1. 2) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, x. 19, 13; 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xiii. 29, 31;

नैदाघ
नै-दाघ
 is the name of the ‘summer’ season in the later 
Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.
	1 Cf. Ṛtu and Nidāgha. 1) Av. ix. 5, 31; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 8, 4, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 
1, 16, etc.; naidāghīya, ‘belonging to 
the summer,’ Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 
xxiii. 16, 8, etc.

नैदान
नै-दान
 is a term applied in the Nirukta
	1 to a class of 
Vedic interpreters. Roth
	2 takes the Naidānas to be ‘etymo
logists,’ but Sieg
	3 thinks they are the same as the Aitihāsikas 
or ‘legendarists.’
	4 1) vi. 9; vii. 12. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. But 
of. Nirukta, Erlāuterungen, 220, 221; 
Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 2^2, 176. 3) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 29. 4) The word seems to mean ‘one 
concerned with the original form’ 
(nidāna).

नैध्रुवि
नै-ध्रुवि,
 ‘descendant of Nidhruva,’ is the patronymic of 
Kaśyapa in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 1) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyandina = vi. 5, 3 Kāṇva).

नैमिशि
नैमिशि
 is the epithet of Śitibāhu Aiṣakṛta in the Jaiminīya 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 It is probably to be taken as an indication that 
Śitibāhu came from the Naimiśa forest. 1) i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192).

नैमिशीय
नैमिशीय,
 
	1 Naimiṣīya
	2 denotes the dwellers in the Naimiśa 
forest. They are mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	2 and the 
Brāhmaṇas,
	2 being clearly of special sanctity. Hence in the 
Epic the Mahābhārata is said to have been recited to the Ṛṣis 
dwelling in the Naimiṣa forest.

नैरुक्त
नैर्-उक्त
 
	1 in the Nirukta
	2 denotes a man who knows the 
true etymology of words, and explains their meaning accord
ingly. Yāska's Nirukta is the classic work of this school, and 
forms a commentary on an earlier Nirukta, the so-called 
Naighaṇṭuka, a glossary consisting of five collections of Vedic 
words. 1) ‘One concerned with etymological 
explanation’ (nir-ukta). 2) i. 12; vi. 11; xi. 19. 29. 31; xii. 10;

नैषाद
नै-षाद,
 a ‘man of Niṣāda,’ is mentioned in the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 15) and the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxx. 8).

नैषिध
नैषिध
 is the reading in the Śata atha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 3, 
2, 1. 2) of the epithet of Naḍa, a king of the south. The later 
form of the name is Naiṣadha; the St. Petersburg Dictionarv 
suggests that its original form was Naiḥṣidha.

नोधस्
नोधस्
 is the name of a poet who is mentioned in the 
Rigveda,
	1 and to whom certain of its hymns are ascribed.
	2 
In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	3 he is called Kākṣīvata, a 
‘descendant of Kakṣīvant.’ Ludwig
	4 regards him as con
temporary with the defeat of Purukutsa. He was a Gotama.
	5 1) i. 61, 14; 62, 13; 64, 1, and 124, 4, 
according to Nirukta, iv. 16. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 18; Rv. 
i. 58-64 are ascribed to him in the 
Anukramaṇī (Index). 3) vii. 10, 10; xxi. 9, 12. Cf. Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 27; viii. 12. 17; Av. 
xv. 2, 4; 4, 4. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. 5) Rv. i. 62, 13; Max Müller, Sacred

i. 124, 4, see Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 
1, 137. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of 
the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 33.

नौ
नौ
 is the regular word in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 for a 
‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was 
merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat 
was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab 
as well as the Yamunā and Gaṅgā. Often no doubt the Nau 
was a mere dug-out canoe (dāru).
	3 It is certainly against the 
theory
	4 of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea 
trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such 
as masts and sails, except the oar (Aritra), Yet there are some 
allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied 
by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda
	5 compares 
the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the 
sinking of a ship which is leaking (bhinnā); though the language 
here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was 
only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover, 
there is mention made in the Rigveda
	6 of men who go to the 
ocean (Samudra) eager for gain (saniṣyavaḥ). It is not altogether 
satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer
	7 to the 
broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with 
the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda
	8 too it is said 
that the Aśvins rescued Bhujyu in the ocean with a ship of 
a hundred oars (śatāritra). It is not easy to refuse to recognize 
here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for 
sea voyages. The Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,
	9 at any rate, 
clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also Samudra. 1) i. 131, 2; ii. 39, 4; viii. 42, 3; 
83, 3, etc. 2) Av. ii. 36, 5; v. 19. 8; Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, v. 3, 10, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃ

vi. 6. 21; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 
1, 4; iv. 2, 5, 10, etc. 3) Rv. x. 155, 3. 4) Wilson, Rigveda, 1, xli. 5) v. 19, 8. Cf. Hopkins, American 
Journal of Philology, 19, 139. So per
haps the passage, Rv. i. 32, 8, nadaṃ 
na bhinnam, refers to a ship. See 
Naḍa. 6) Rv. i. 56, 2; iv. 55, 6. 7) Altindisches Leben, 22, 23. 8) i. 116, 3 et seq. 9) i. 2, 4; ii. 2, 2. But it is not of 
very early date.

न्यग्रोध
न्यग्-रोध,
 ‘growing downwards,’ is the name of the 
Ficus indica, a tree remarkable for sending down from its 
branches fibres which take root and form new stems. Though 
the tree is not mentioned by name in the Rigveda, it appears 
to have been known, as Pischel
	1 has shown from a hymn
	2 in 
which its characteristics may be recognized. It is frequently 
mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	3 and the later literature.
	4 The 
sacrificial bowls (Camasa) were made of its wood.
	5 It was 
doubtless of the greatest importance, as in modern times, to 
the Vedic village. The sister tree, the Aśvattha (Ficus religiosa), 
already occurs in the Rigveda. 1) Vedische Studien, 1, 113, 114. 2) i. 24, 7, where stūpa seems to 
denote the crest or crown of the tree 
above the main trunk. 3) iv. 37, 4; v. 5, 5. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 30. 31;

न्यङ्क
न्य्-अङ्क
 in the dual denotes in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 and 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 some part of the chariot, parallel with Aṅka. The 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	3 has Nyaṅkū, the dual of Nyaṅku. 1) i. 7, 7, 2. 2) i. 3, 5, 4; ii. 7, 8, 1. 3) i. 7, 5; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, 
ii. 8, 9.

न्यङ्कु
न्यङ्कु
 is the name of an animal in the list of victims at the 
Aśvamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 
It seems clear that a kind a ‘gazelle’ is meant, but the com
mentary on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 suggests ‘bear’ (ṛkṣa) as 
a variant rendering. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. The 
metre nyaṅku-sāriṇī, ‘with a gazelle's 
gait,’ is already mentioned in the 
Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvi. 31; Chandas, 
5; Nidāna Sūtra, i. 2. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 9; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 27. 32. Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 83. The 
metre nyaṅku-sāriṇī, ‘with a gazelle's 
gait,’ is already mentioned in the 
Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvi. 31; Chandas, 
5; Nidāna Sūtra, i. 2.

न्यस्तिका
न्य्-अस्तिका
 seems in the Atharvaveda
	1 to denote a plant of 
some kind, identified by the scholiast with the Śaṅkhapuṣpikā 
(Andropogon aciculatus). 1) vi. 139, 1. Cf. Whitney, Transla
tion of the Atharvaveda, 385; Bloom
field, ymns of the Atharvaveda, 539, 
540.

न्योचनी
न्य्-ओचनी
 is found in the marriage hymn of the Rigveda 
(x. 85, 6), where some kind of ornament worn by women seems 
to be meant. The commentator Sāyaṇa interprets it as 
‘female slave.’

पक्ति
पक्ति
 denotes a cooked object, probably a kind of ‘cake,’ in 
the Saṃhitās.
	1 One who cooks food is called Paktṛ.
	2 1) Rv. iv. 24, 5. 7; 25, 6. 7; vi. 29, 
4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 59, etc. 2) Av. x. 9, 7. 11. 25; xi. 1, 17; 
xii. 3, 17; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 
4, 17; x. 4, 2, 19.

पक्थ
पक्थ
 is the name of a people in the Rigveda,
	1 where they 
appear as one of the tribes that opposed
	2 the Tṛtsu-Bharatas in 
the Dāśarājña. or ‘battle of the ten kings.’ Zimmer
	3 compares 
them with the tribe of  and their country , 
mentioned as in the north-west of India by Herodotus,
	4 and 
with the modern Pakhthūn in Eastern Afghanistan, holding 
that they were a northern tribe; this is probable, since the 
Bharatas seem to have occupied the Madhyadeśa, or ‘Middle 
Land.’ In three passages of the Rigveda
	5 a Paktha is referred 
to as a protégé of the Aśvins. The second connects him with 
Trasadasyu, whose tribe, the Pūrus, were aided by the Pakthas 
in their unsuccessful onslaught on Sudās. In the third passage 
he seems specified as Tūrvāyaṇa, and appears as an opponent 
of Cyavāna.
	6 Probably, therefore, Paktha in all cases denotes 
the king of the Paktha people. 1) vii. 18. 7. 2) Roth, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte 
des Weda, 95, thought that the Pakthas 
were allies of the Trtsus, but this view 
is certainly incorrect. Cf. Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
15, 260. 3) Altindisches Leben, 430, 431. 4) vii. 65 (); iii. 102 and iv. 44 
(). 5) viii. 22, 10; 49, 10; x. 61, 1. 6) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 71-77.

पक्व
पक्व,
 ‘cooked,’ is used substantively as meaning ‘cooked 
food’
	1 or ‘cooked milk.’
	2 The word is also used of ‘baked’ 
bricks.
	3 1) Rv. vi. 63, 9; Av. vi. 119, 2; 
xii. 3, 55; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 
1, 26; ii. 6, 1, 7, etc. 2) Rv. i. 62, 9; 180, 3; ii. 40, 2; 
iii. 30, 14; vi. 44, 24, etc. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 1, 2, 22; vii. 2, 1, 7.

पक्ष
पक्ष
 is, in the Atharvaveda,
	1 applied to some part of a 
house, either the ‘side posts,’ according to Roth,
	2 Zimmer,
	3 
and Grill,
	4 or ‘sides,’ as understood by Whitney
	5 and Bloom
field.
	6 The description of the roof (Chadis) in the Atharvaveda
	7 
as catuṣ-pakṣa, ‘four-sided,’ tells in favour of the second 
explanation. In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	8 Pakṣa is used of 
the sides of a chariot. For Pakṣa as the ‘half’ of a month, see 
Māsa. 1) ix. 3, 4. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 153. 4) Hundert Lieder^2, 188. 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda,

Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 
210.

पक्षस्
पक्षस्
 is found in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 meaning the ‘sides’
	3 of a chariot. In the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā
	4 and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	5 it is used of the sides 
of a hut or chamber (Śālā). In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	6 it 
means the ‘wing’ of a door. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	7 the 
‘half’ of an army is so named, and in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa
	8 it means the ‘half’ of a month, or ‘fortnight.’ Cf. 
Pakṣa. 1) viii. 8, 22. 2) vii. 7. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 506; Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 117. 4) xxx. 5. 5) i. 2, 3, 1. 6) xxix. 5. 7) ii. 9. 8) xxiii. 6, 6.

पक्षिन्
पक्षिन्
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘winged’ 
creature, more particularly a ‘bird.’ 1) i. 48. 5; 182, 5; x. 127, 5, etc. 2) Av. iv. 34, 4; xi. 5, 21; xii. 1, 51; 
xiii. 2, 33; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 8; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 23; Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 5, 18, etc.

पङ्क्ति
पङ्क्ति,
 originally a ‘set of five,’ denotes as early as the 
Rigveda
	1 a ‘series’ generally. In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	2 the 
word is used of the series of a man's ancestors whom he purifies 
by certain conduct. 1) x. 117, 8, as taken by the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 2) x. 38, 39.

पचत
पचत,
 like Pakti, denotes ‘cooked food’ in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 1) i. 61, 7; x. 116, 8. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 60; 
xxiii. 13; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21, 
etc.

पचन
पचन
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Śatapatha Brāhamaṇa
	2 
denotes a ‘vessel for cooking’ food. 1) i. 162, 6. 2) vi. 5, 43, 3. 4; xiv. 1, 2, 21.

पज्र
पज्र
 is the name of the family from which Kakṣīvant 
sprang (Pajriya). It is mentioned several times in the Rigveda.
	1 
According to Pischel,
	2 the epithet pṛkṣa-yāma
	3 applied to them 
means ‘carrying out brilliant sacrificial performances,’ which 
won for them Śrutaratha's generosity. In two passages
	4 
Roth
	5 sees a Pajra called Sāmaṅ. This is uncertain, but in 
any case a Pajra seems clearly alluded to. Elsewhere
	6 it is 
very doubtful whether the word is a proper name at all. In 
the Śāṭyāyana
	7 the Pajras are declared to be Aṅgirases. 1) i. 117, 10; 122, 7. 8; 126, 4. 5. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 97, 98. 3) Rv. i. 127, 8, where Roth (St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.) thinks this 
compound is probably a proper name. 4) Rv. viii. 4, 17; 6, 47. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. pajra. 6) Rv. i. 190, 5, where the reference 
is clearly hostile and contemptuous. 7) Cited by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 51, 4.

पज्रा
पज्रा
 occurs once in the Rigveda,
	1 where Ludwig
	2 sees in 
the word the name of the wife of the sacrificer, Pajra, while 
Roth
	3 takes it to be an epithet (‘stout’) of the Soma plant. 
The sense is thus uncertain. 1) ix. 82, 14. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
pajra.

पज्रिय
पज्रिय
 ‘descendant of Pajra,’ is the patronymic
	1 of 
Kakṣīvant in the Rigveda.
	2 1) Cf. Tugrya, n. 1. 2) i. 116, 7; 117, 6; 120, 5.

पञ्चजनाः
पञ्च-जनाः,
 the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various 
names in Vedic literature.
	1 Who are meant by the five is very 
uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	2 explains the five to be 
gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers. 
Aupamanyava
	3 held that the four castes (Varṇa) and the 
Niṣādas made up the five, and Sāyaṇa
	4 is of the same opinion. 
Yāska
	5 thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods, 
Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be 
regarded as probable. Roth
	6 and Geldner
	7 think that all the 
peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters 
(Diś), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with 
the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer
	8 opposes this view on 
the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is 
not in harmony with the distinction so often made between 
Āryan and Dāsa; that neither janāsaḥ, ‘men,’
	9 nor mānuṣāḥ, 
‘people,’
	10 could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is 
referred to as being among the five tribes;
	11 that the five tribes 
are mentioned as on the Sarasvatī,
	12 and that Indra is pāñca- 
janya,
	13 ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that 
Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the 
Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas, and Pūrus, who are all 
mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the 
Rigveda,
	14 and four of whom occur in another hymn.
	15 But he 
admits that the expression might easily be used more generally 
later. Hopkins
	16 has combated Zimmer's view, but his own 
opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people 
named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa, 
and that theory is not very probable. 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	17 and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	18 
the five peoples are opposed to the Bharatas, and in the former 
work
	19 seven peoples are alluded to. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 31; iv. 27; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 1, 2; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, v. 6; xxxii. 6; Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad, iv. 2, 9 (pañca-janāḥ as a 
compound). See also pañca mānuṣāḥ, 
Rv. viii. 9, 2; mānavāḥ, Av. iii. 21, 5; 
24, 3; xii. 1, 15; janāḥ, Rv. iii. 37, 9; 
59, 8; vi. 14, 4; viii. 32, 22; ix. 65, 
23; 92, 3; x. 45, 6; kṛṣṭayaḥ, ii. 2, 10; 
iii. 53, 16; iv. 38, 10; x. 60, 4; 119, 6; 
Av. iii. 24, 3; kṣitayaḥ, Rv. i. 7, 9; 
176, 3; v. 35, 2; vi. 46, 7; vii. 75, 4; 
79, 1; carṣaṇyaḥ, Rv. v. 86, 2; vii. 15, 2; 
ix. 101, 9. See Ludwig, Translation of 
the Rigveda, 3, 204. Every book of 
the Rigveda has a mention of the five 
peoples: one such in ii. and iv.; two 
in i., v., vi., vii., viii.; three in iii. and 
ix.; four in x. 2) iii. 31. 3) In Yāska, Nirukta, iii. 8. 4) On Rv. i. 7, 9, etc. 5) Nirukta, loc. cit. 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. kṛṣṭi, 
Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 28. For his 
view, Av. iii. 24, 3, can be cited: pañca 
pradiśo mānavīḥ pañca kṛṣṭayaḥ, ‘the 
five directions, the five races of 
men.’ 7) Siebenzig Lieder, 18. See, however, 
Ṛgveda, Glossar, 103, where he recog
nizes the use of the phrase to denote 
five tribes, as well as all mankind. 8) Altindisches Leben, 119-123. His 
view is accepted by Macdonell, Sanskrit 
Literature, 153; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 
1^2, 179, is doubtful. 9) Cf. its use in Rv. ii. 12, sa janāsa 
Indraḥ, where the address must be to 
Āryan men. 10) Cf. Rv. viii. 9, 2, and i. 52, 9, 
with viii. 70, 11; x. 28, 8. 11) Rv. ix. 65, 23. 12) Rv. vi. 61, 12 (pañca jātā). Cf. 
x. 53, 4. 13) v. 32, 11. Agni is ‘of the five 
tribes,’ Rv. ix. 66, 20. Atri also is so 
described, Rv. i. 117, 3. 14) Rv. i. 108, 8. In vii. 18, cited by 
Zimmer, 122, the five tribes do not 
occur eo nomine, for Yakṣu replaces 
Yadu. But it is probable that Yadu is 
meant by Yakṣu. 15) Rv. viii. 10, 5. 16) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 260. 17) xiii. 5, 4, 14. 18) viii. 23. 19) It is a conjecture of Weber's, 
Indische Studien, 1, 202, that the five 
peoples are identical with the Pañcālas, 
and the seven mentioned in Satapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 23, with the 
Kuru-Pañcālas.

पञ्चदशी
पञ्च-दशी,
 ‘the fifteenth day of the month,’ is already 
mentioned in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (i. 5, 10, 5).

पञ्चनद
पञ्च-नद,
 ‘having five streams,’ is not found until the 
epic period as the name of the Panjāb, which has no desig
nation in the earlier literature. The importance of the Panjāb 
as the home
	1 of the Rigveda has been greatly diminished by 
recent research, Hopkins,
	2 Pischel,
	3 and Geldner
	4 having on 
different grounds shown reason for believing that the Rigveda, 
at least in great part, was composed farther east, in the 
Madhyadeśa, which admittedly was the home of the later Vedic 
culture. Hillebrandt
	5 considers that the Rigveda belongs in 
part to the Panjāb, or rather to Arachosia, and in part to the 
Middle Country. See also Kuru, Tṛtsu. 1) See, e.g., Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
32 et seq. 2) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 19, 19-28. Cf. Macdonell, 
Sanskrit Literature, 145, 441. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 218. 4) Ibid., 3, 152. 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 98 et seq. 
But see Divodāsa. Cf. also Weber, 
Indische Studien, 1, 189.

पञ्चविंशब्राह्मण
पञ्चविंश ब्राह्मण
 See Tāṇdya.

पञ्चाल
पञ्चाल
 is the later name
	1 of the people called Krivi in the 
Rigveda. The Pañcālas are rarely referred to except in con
nexion with the Kurus, and the kings of the Kuru-Pañcālas 
are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā
	3 the Pañcālas appear as the people of Keśin Dālbhya. 
In the Upaniṣads and later
	4 the Brahmins of the Pañcālas 
figure as taking part in philosophical and philological dis
cussions. The Saṃhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	5 makes mention of 
the Prācya-Pañcālas. 
The Pañcālas, no doubt, included other tribes besides the 
Krivis. The name seems to refer to five tribes, and it has 
been suggested
	6 that the Pañcālas represent the five tribes of 
the Rigveda, but the suggestion is not very probable. There 
is no trace in Vedic literature of the Epic division of the 
Pañcālas into northern (uttara) and southern (dakṣiṇa). The 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	7 mentions their town Paricakrā; other 
towns to which allusion seems to be made were Kāmpīla and 
kauśāmbī.
	8 Of their kings and chiefs, as distinguished from 
kings of the Kuru-Pañcālas, we hear of Kraivya, Durmukha, 
Pravāhaṇa Jaivali, and Śona. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 7. 2) viii. 14 3) xxx. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 471). 4) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1

पञ्चालचण्ड
पञ्चाल-चण्ड
 is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya
	1 
and the Śāṅkhāyana
	2 Āraṇyakas. 1) iii. 1, 6. 2) vii. 18. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 391; 
Indian Literature, 50, 315, 326.

पञ्चावि
पञ्चावि
 occurs several times in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 in 
the sense of ‘aged five lamb-periods’ (of six months), that is, 
‘thirty months old.’
	2 1) xviii. 26; xxi. 14; xxiv. 12; xxviii. 26. 2) Cf. Tryavi.

पञ्चौदन
पञ्चौदन
 is an adjective in the Atharvaveda
	1 meaning 
‘prepared with five rice-messes.’ The cooking of five rice 
dishes is referred to in the same Saṃhitā.
	2 1) iv. 14, 7; ix. 5, 8 et seq. 2) ix. 5, 37.

पटल
पटल
 as early as the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes ‘section’ 
of a work, a sense occurring in the Sūtras
	2 and later. 1) i. 21. 22. 2) Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, xi. 9. 
20; xiii. 21, 2; Āśvalāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, iv. 6. 7.

पठर्वन्
पठर्वन्
 appears to be the name of a man in the Rigveda.
	1 
According to Ludwig,
	2 however, the word is Paṭharu, and is 
the name of a fort which was saved by a rain-storm from 
being set on fire. 1) i. 112, 17, with Sāyaṇa's note. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 204. 
Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 
147, 148.

पड्गृभि
पड्गृभि,
 ‘seizing by the foot,’
	1 is the name in the Rigveda
	2 
of either a man
	3 or a demon. See also Paḍbīśa. 1) But it may mean ‘seizing with a 
cord.’ Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 
p. 34 (top); Pischel, Vedische Studien, 
1, 236. 2) x. 49, 5. 3) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 165.

पड्बीश
पड्-बीश,
 the ‘foot-fetter’ of a horse in five passages, two 
in the Rigveda,
	1 and one each in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	2 
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	3 and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.
	4 
Elsewhere
	5 its uses are metaphorical. According to Roth,
	6 the 
literal sense is ‘foot-fastening’ (paḍ being = pad, ‘foot,’ and 
bīśa, written vīśa in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, being connected 
with the Latin vincire, ‘bind’). Pischel
	7 objects that the 
sense of ‘foot-fastening’ involves the absurdity, in the Upaniṣad 
passages, of a fine horse from the Sindhu (Indus) being spoken 
of as tearing up the peg to which it is fastened. He suggests 
instead the meaning of ‘hobble,’ which must be right.
	8 1) i. 162, 14. 16 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
iv. 6, 9, 1. 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxv. 38. 39. 2) vi. 2, 13 (Mādhyaṃdina). 3) v. 1, 12. 4) ix. 7; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 
57, n. 3. 5) Rv. x. 97, 16; Av. viii. 1, 4; xii. 5, 
15; xvi. 8, 27; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 6, 10, 3; Mantra Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 10. 6) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 233-236. 8) He explains the first part of the 
word as derived from paś, ‘tie.’ Cf. 
Macdoneli, Vedic Grammar, p. 34 (top). 
But the form paḍ may be due to a 
false analogy, and the sense of ‘foot
fastener’ may express ‘hobble’ quite 
satisfactorily; it is not confined to a 
rope tied to a peg in the ground.

पण
पण,
 with Pratipaṇa, is found in a hymn of the Atharva
veda
	1 denoting the process of bargaining and selling. The 
root paṇ, from which the word is derived, is employed in the 
later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas,
	2 while Paṇana in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 denotes ‘trafficking.’ Cf. Vaṇij. 1) iii. 15, 4. 6 (in the Paippalāda 
recension; Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 112). 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 55; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 3, 1 et seq.; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 27. Cf. Tait
tirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 10, 1. 3) iii. 3, 2, 19. The root does not 
occur in the Rigveda, but its etymology 
is vouched for by the Greek , 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 
84, n. 3.

पणि
पणि
 in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is 
rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow 
Dakṣiṇās on the priests, and who is therefore an object of 
intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā.
	1 Hence the 
gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to 
as being defeated with slaughter.
	2 The Paṇi is opposed to the 
pious sacrificer as a niggard,
	3 and is spoken of as a wolf,
	4 the 
symbol of enmity. In some passages
	5 the Paṇis definitely 
appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows 
or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission 
from Indra.
	6 Among the Paṇis Bṛbu was apparently important. 
In one passage of the Rigveda
	7 they are described as Beka- 
nāṭas, or ‘usurers’ (?). In another
	8 they are called Dasyus, 
and styled mṛdhra-vāc, probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and grathin, 
a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt
	9 thinks that the 
latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which 
is not understood, and that mṛdhra-vāc means ‘śpeaking an 
enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to 
non-Āryans.
	10 In two passages
	11 the Paṇis appear as Dāsas, 
and in one
	12 a Paṇi is mentioned in connexion with wer
geld (Vaira), being apparently regarded as equal to a man 
merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as 
inferior. 
It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Paṇi was. Roth
	13 
thinks that the word is derived from paṇ, ‘barter,’ and that 
the Paṇi is properly the man who will give nothing without 
return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor 
rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer
	14 and 
by Ludwig.
	15 The latter scholar thinks the apparent references 
to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been 
aboriginal traders who went in caravans — as in Arabia and 
Northern Africa — prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their 
goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem 
quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references 
to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly 
necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as 
non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term 
is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan 
tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt,
	16 however, thinks that 
a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they 
were associated with the Dahae (Dāsa). Moreover, he finds 
them associated in one passage
	17 with the Pārāvatas, whom 
he identifies with the  of Ptolemy,
	18 and with Bṛṣaya, 
whom he connects with  of Arrian;
	19 he also con
siders that the frequent
	20 mention of the Paṇis as opponents 
of Divodāsa shows that the latter was on the Arachosian 
Haraqaiti (Sarasvatī) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae, 
as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Paṇi 
and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root paṇ, which 
is found also in the Greek , shows a satisfactory deri
vation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is 
improbable. See also Divodāsa and Bekanāṭa. 1) Rv. i. 33, 3; 83, 2; 151, 9; 180, 7;

 ‘banner,’ is not found until the Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa.

पति
पति, पत्नी
 — Under these words denoting primarily, as the 
evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows, 
‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient 
to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community. 
Child Marriage. — Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears 
essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This 
is shown by the numerous references
	1 to unmarried girls who 
grow old in the house of their fathers (amā-jur), and who adorn 
themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia 
of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition
	2 to 
compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the 
Rigveda
	3 itself seems to present us with a spell by which a 
lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his 
beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Sūtra period, 
though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage 
before puberty there obtained.
	4 The marriage ritual also quite 
clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal 
one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her 
husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation.
	5 
Limitations on Marriage. — It is difficult to say with certainty 
within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of 
Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda
	6 seems clearly to point to a 
prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can 
hardly be said, as Weber
	7 thinks, to point to a practice that 
was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila 
Gṛhya Sūtra
	8 and the Dharma Sūtras
	9 are found prohibitions 
against marriage in the Gotra (‘family’) or within six degrees 
on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	10 marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation, 
the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin,
	11 by the 
Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣi
ṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's 
brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not 
with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the 
father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the 
Gotra cannot then have existed,
	12 though naturally marriages 
outside the Gotra were frequent.
	13 Similarity of caste was also 
not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even 
by the Dharma Sūtras,
	14 so that a Brāhmaṇa could marry 
wives of any lower caste, a Kṣatriya wives of the two lowest 
castes as well as of his own caste, a Vaiśya a Śūdrā as well as 
a Vaiśyā, although the Śūdrā marriages were later disapproved 
in toto. Instances of such intermarriage are common in the 
Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā.
	15 
It was considered proper that the younger brothers and 
sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before 
them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas
	16 present a series 
of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful 
those who bear them. These terms are the pari-vividāna,
	17 or 
perhaps agre-dadhus,
	18 the man who, though a younger brother, 
marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the 
parivitta;
	19 the agre-didhiṣu,
	20 the man who weds a younger 
daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the 
Didhiṣū-pati,
	21 who is the husband of the latter. The passages 
do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always 
be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order 
was often broken. 
Widow Remarriage. — The remarriage of a widow was 
apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the 
form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other 
nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children. 
At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral 
hymn of the Rigveda;
	22 for the alternative explanation, which 
sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha 
(‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt
	23 and 
Delbrück,
	24 is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is 
supported by the Sūtra evidence.
	25 Moreover, another passage 
of the Rigveda
	26 clearly refers to the marriage of the widow 
and the husband's brother (devṛ), which constitutes what the 
Indians later knew as Niyoga.
	27 This custom was probably 
not followed except in cases where no son was already born. 
This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since 
the brother might — so far as appears — be already married 
himself. In the Atharvaveda,
	28 a verse refers to a charm which 
would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her 
second husband. Though, as Delbrück
	29 thinks, this very 
possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still 
alive,
	30 but was impotent or had lost caste (patita),
	31 still it is 
certain that the later Dharma Sūtras
	32 began to recognize 
ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband. 
Pischel
	33 finds some evidence in the Rigveda
	34 to the effect 
that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and 
could not be found or heard of. 
Polygamy. — A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife. 
This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda;
	35 
Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
	36 had ten wives; 
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	37 explains polygamy by a 
characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four 
wives attributed to him, the Mahiṣī,
	38 the Parivṛktī,
	39 the 
Vāvātā,
	40 and the Pālāgalī.
	41 The Mahiṣī appears to be the 
chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa.
	42 The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained 
by Weber
	43 and Pischel
	44 as one that has had no son. The 
Vāvātā is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pālāgalī is, according to 
Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The 
names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence 
points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest 
sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by 
Delbrück,
	45 that in the sacrifice the Patnī is usually mentioned 
in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mytho
logical reason.
	46 Zimmer
	47 is of opinion that polygamy is 
dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed 
from polygamy; Weber,
	48 however, thinks that polygamy is 
secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthro
pology.
	49 
Polyandry. — On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic.
	50 
There is no passage containing any clear reference to such 
a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda
	51 
and the Atharvaveda
	52 verses are occasionally found in which 
husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is 
difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate 
instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's
	53 
view, that the plural is here used majestatis causā, is not 
accepted, Delbrück's
	54 explanation by mythology is probably 
right. In other passages
	55 the plural is simply generic. 
Marital Relations. — Despite polygamy, however, there is 
ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber
	56 has 
suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife 
was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's 
being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several 
passages,
	57 indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence, 
intercourse with the strī of another. This may imply that 
adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as 
venial. But as the word strī includes all the ‘womenfolk,’ 
daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly 
be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was 
normally regarded with indifference.
	58 The curious ritual of 
the Varuṇapraghāsās,
	59 in which the wife of the sacrificer is 
questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück
	60 to be a 
part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife, 
not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife. 
Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	61 
which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste 
(paraḥ-puṃsā) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife 
is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of 
the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in 
question. Monogamy is also evidently approved,
	62 so that 
some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On 
the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to 
other Indo-Germanic
	63 peoples that the adulterer taken in the 
act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature 
has traces of this rule.
	64 There is also abundant evidence that 
the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high. 
Hetairai. — In the Rigveda
	65 there are many references to 
illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of 
such unions,
	66 especially in the case of a protégé of Indra, 
often mentioned as the parāvṛkta or parāvṛj.
	67 The ‘son of 
a maiden’ (kumārī-putra) is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā.
	68 Such a person appears with a metronymic in the 
Upaniṣad period:
	69 this custom may be the origin of metro
nymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists 
of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	70 The 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	71 refers to illicit unions of Śūdra and Ārya, 
both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at 
the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose desig
nations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ (atītvarī)
	72 and ‘procuress 
of abortion’ (atiṣkadvarī),
	73 while the ‘dyeing woman’ (rajayitrī) 
is dedicated to sensuality.
	74 Pischel and Geldner also see 
many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda,
	75 
especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of 
Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any 
rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ (nṛtū) referred to in 
one passage of the Rigveda
	76 was a Hetaira. When women 
are referred to as going to the Samana, or ‘place of meeting,’ 
Hetairai are probably also meant.
	77 Grave cases of immorality 
are alluded to in the Rigveda.
	78 The love of father and 
daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati,
	79 is evidently 
censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is 
recognized in the Atharvaveda.
	80 Girls who had lost their 
natural protectors — father or brother
	81 — were apt to be reduced 
to live by immorality. 
Forms of Marriage. — The state of society revealed in the 
Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part 
of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband. 
At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother 
controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age,
	82 
though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suit
able match.
	83 The marriage was frequently arranged through 
an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ (vara),
	84 presumably after those 
concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of 
a daughter was not unknown,
	85 but a certain amount of dis
credit would seem to have attached to it,
	86 and sons-in-law in 
such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries 
were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels 
Suffered from bodily defects.
	87 Occasionally marriages by 
capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as 
when Vimada carried off Purumitra's daughter against her 
father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent.
	88 The 
later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various 
forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types: 
(a) that which is based on mutual consent, the prājāpatya 
(‘connected with Prajāpati’); (b) that in which a price is paid 
for the bride, the āsura (‘Asura-like’), ārṣa (‘connected with 
the Ṛṣis’), brāhma (‘relating to Brahman’), or daiva (‘divine’); 
(c) those which consist in stealing the bride, the kṣātra 
(‘warrior-like’) or the rākṣasa (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of 
which traces are found in Vedic literature.
	89 For instance, 
the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is 
exemplified in the story of Cyavana in the Jaiminīya Brāh
maṇa,
	90 and in that of Śyāvāśva in the Bṛhaddevatā.
	91 
Wedding Ceremony. — In normal marriages the bridal was 
celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials 
and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by 
other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples,
	92 
and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness 
of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house,
	93 
to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired, 
and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride.
	94 
A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests.
	95 
The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone, 
formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household 
fire.
	96 This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence 
being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ (hasta-grābha).
	97 The 
festivities being over,
	98 the bridegroom took the bride to his 
home on a car in a marriage procession,
	99 all to the accom
paniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation.
	100 
Wife's Property and Status. — We have very little information 
as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage. 
It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's 
dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the 
Epic
	101 the rise of the recognition of women's property as 
their own (strī-dhana) is only slow. That the husband was 
absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though 
he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was 
expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law. 
The poetical ideal
	102 of the family was decidedly high, and we 
have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled. 
Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an 
honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress 
in her husband's home, exercising authority over her father
in-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters.
	103 
No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son 
of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude
	104 of 
the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress 
of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still 
unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress else
where
	105 laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then 
is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties, 
and controls the house while his son continues to live with 
him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son 
had set up a separate family of his own.
	106 
Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings 
of the husband. In this connexion the term Patnī regularly 
applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas,
	107 where Jāyā designates her 
in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice. 
In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	108 describes a certain ceremony in which 
the wife (jāyā) alone offered the oblation in former times, while 
later a priest might do so instead. The same Brāhmaṇa 
shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women, 
probably due to the growing sense of the importance of cere
monial priority.
	109 So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	110 women 
generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils, 
and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’
	111 and connected with 
Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’
	112 A woman too, according to the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā,
	113 is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic 
reference is made in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	114 to her power of 
getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the 
other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is 
half her husband,
	115 and completes him;
	116 and in the Rigveda
	117 
attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their 
good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate 
a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the 
rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband.
	118 Scolds 
were also known: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	119 praises the wife 
‘who does not answer back’ (aprativādinī). Women bore no 
part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	120 expressly says. On the other hand, 
with the advance of education, women shared in the intel
lectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's
	121 
two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical 
discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to 
in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married 
is not certain.
	122 
But the main object of a woman's marriage was the pro
duction of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the 
Rigveda and later.
	123 The desire for offspring, as was natural 
in a society which mainly counted relationship through the 
father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the 
necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line. 
It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda
	124 
this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice 
is recognized,
	125 as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the 
appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of 
a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonless
ness’ (avīratā) is placed on the same level as lack of property 
(amati), and Agni is besought to protect from it.
	126 The birth 
of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Athar
vaveda
	127 in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son, 
and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa
	128 contains an old verse which says that a daughter is 
a misery (kṛpaṇam), while a son is a light in the highest heaven 
(jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman). But there is no proof that 
the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children. 
This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later 
Saṃhitās
	129 by Zimmer
	130 and Delbrück,
	131 has been disproved 
by Böhtlingk. 
Child Life. — No doubt the care of a child was left to 
the mother, but we learn little from the earlier litera
ture
	132 of the life of the young. The length of the period 
of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar) 
months.
	133 On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee, 
and then given the breast.
	134 On the eighth day after birth 
the infant was washed.
	135 The cutting of the teeth was also 
a solemn occasion,
	136 and is the subject of a hymn in the 
Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning 
to speak, which the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	137 ascribes to the end 
of the first year of life. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	138 asserts that 
the words Tata and Tāta, onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’
	139 
are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps 
an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda
	140 
further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the 
first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name 
was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often 
added.
	141 
Satī. — On the death of her husband, in some cases the 
widow burned herself or was burned by his relations.
	142 This 
is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in 
the Atharvaveda.
	143 On the other hand, the Rigveda does not 
contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary con
siders the widow as married apparently to the brother of the 
dead man.
	144 The custom of Suttee would therefore appear 
during the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as 
a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been 
mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge 
from the other Indo-Germanic parallels.
	145 In other classes 
the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of 
widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof 
that there were widows who could be remarried.
	146 1) Cf. Rv. i. 117, 7; ii. 17, 7; x. 39, 
3; 40, 5. Ghoṣā is the chief example 
of this condition. The Atharvaveda 
(i. 14) also refers to such a case (see 
Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
253). The ornaments of maidens, espe
cially at seasons of festival, are referred 
to in Rv. i. 123, 11; vii. 2, 5; Av. 
ii. 36, 1; xiv. 2, 59 et seq. 2) Cf. Av. iii. 18 (= Rv. x. 145); 
vi. 89; 102; 130; 131; vii. 36; 37; 38. 
Similarly there are many references to 
the love of the youth for the maiden, 
and his seeking her — e.g., Rv. i. 115, 2; 
Av. ii. 30; iii. 25; vi. 8; 9; 82; to 
their mutual affection — e.g., Rv. i. 167, 
3; ix. 32, 5; 56, 3; x. 34, 5; and to 
jealousy and love philtres for the pur
pose of recalling wandering affections 
-e.g., Av. vi. 18; 42; 43; 94; 139; 
vii. 45. The gifts of the lover are 
referred to in Rv. i. 117, 18. Some of 
these passages may, of course, refer to 
Hetairai, but not all. 3) vii. 55, 5. 8. Cf. Rv. i. 134, 3; 
Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 337 et seq. 
A different view of the passage is taken 
by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 57 et seq. 
The Atharvaveda (iv. 5) shows that the 
view of Aufrecht was that early adopted 
in India. 4) Cf. Jolly, Recht und Sitte, 59; Hop
kins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 13, 340 et seq.; 23, 356; Risley,

possible reference to a child-wife in 
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1.

pari-vividāna follows, it seems very 
doubtful; the reading is probably 
wrong, especially in view of the Kāṭhaka

agre-didhiṣau and agre-dadhiṣau. 19) See passages cited in note 17; also

probably the two words should be 
identical in sense. 20) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (see note 17) has 
agre-didhiṣu; Kapiṣṭhala, agre-dadhiṣu;

agre-didhiṣu. 21) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā has didhiṣū-pati; 
Kapiṣṭhala, dadhiṣū-pati; and so the 
Dharma Sūtras. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,

clusive, since it is bound up with the 
usage of child marriage, which deprived 
both son and daughter of any free choice.

Indra and Agni as more generous than 
a vijāmātṛ, ‘son-in-law,’ or a syāla, 
‘brother-in-law.’ The force of vi in 
the former word must be unfavourable, 
and the sense, as indicated by Pischel, 
is no doubt, that a son-in-law who was 
not in other respects altogether suitable 
might have to buy his bride at a heavy 
cost. The vijāmātṛ is, in fact, the 
aśrīro jāmātā, the ‘ignoble son-in-law,’ 
of Rv. viii. 2, 20. Cf. Yāska, Nirukta, 
vi. 9; Bloomfield, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 15, 255. 87) Cf. Rv. vi. 28, 5; x. 27, 12; Av. 
v. 17, 12. Possibly in Rv. i. 109, 2, 
there is a reference to a generous 
brother giving his sister a dowry in 
order to get her a husband. Cf. Hop
kins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 13, 345; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 
5, 459; Kaegi, Der Rigveda, n. 352; 
Zimmer, op. cit., 310, n. It is doubtful 
whether anudeyī in Rv. x. 85, 6, means 
‘dowry’ or not. See Whitney, Trans
lation of the Atharvaveda, 741. 88) Cf. Rv. i. 112, 19; 116, 1; 117,

that Kamadyū was daughter of Puru-

‘pleasant’ (syonā) to her mother-in-law, 
which is correct on either theory of her 
position as a daughter or a mistress. 104) Cf. Rv. i. 70, 5, where an old

even if the father-in-law were decrepit; 
but it is hardly likely that, in these 
circumstances, the strong sense of 
respect evident in Av. viii. 6, 24, which 
implies fear, would have developed. 107) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 2, 14;

and Nanna are instances (cf. Weinhold, 
Altnordisches Leben, 476 et seq.). The 
universality of the custom must not be 
exaggerated, as Zimmer, 331, is inclined 
to do. To burn all the wives of a king 
would, in primitive ages, have been a 
wasteful action; even the chief wife 
would often have had to be spared on 
one ground or another. The Rigveda 
already reveals a state of society in 
which the actual burning of the wife 
was avoided by a semblance of it in 
the funeral ritual of (cf. Macdonell, 
Sanskrit Literature, 126). The reward 
of a good wife was to go to the world 
of her husband (pati-loka) after death 
(cf. Av. xiv. 1, 64; xviii. 3, 1; Rv. 
x. 85, 43). A Vedic citation in the 
scholiast on Pāṇini, iii. 2, 8, Vārttika, 2, 
says that a Brahmin woman who drinks 
Surā, an intoxicating liquor, does not 
go to the world of her husband after 
death. 146) Cf. perhaps the gartāruh of Rv. 
i. 124, 7, as explained by Yāska, 
Nirukta, iii. 5; Geldner, Rigveda, Kom-

पत्ति
पत्ति
 is used in the Atharvaveda (vii. 62, 1) to designate the 
‘foot soldier’ in war as opposed to the Rathin, ‘charioteer,’ 
the latter defeating (ji) the former. One of the epithets of 
Rudra in the Śatarudriya liturgy of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 
(xvi. 19) is ‘lord of footmen’ (pattīnāṃ pati).

पत्नी
पत्नी
 See Pati. A part of the house is the Patnīnāṃ 
Sadana, mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	1 presumably the 
women's quarters. The phrase is borrowed from the Patnī- 
śāla, ‘hut for the wife,’ of the Brāhmaṇa
	2 ritual. 1) ix. 3, 7. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 18; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 9, 8; x. 2, 
3, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 22 (-śālā); 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xix. 6, etc.

पथिन्सौभर
पथिन् सौभर
 (‘descendant of Sobhari’) is mentioned in 
the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad
	1 as the pupil of Ayāsya Āṅgirasa. 1) ii. 5, 22 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3 Kāṇva); iv. 5, 28 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 6, 
3 Kāṇva).

पथिकृत्
पथि-कृत्,
 ‘path-maker,’ is not a rare epithet in the Rigveda
	1 
and later,
	2 showing clearly the importance naturally attached 
in primitive times to the finding of roads. The frequency 
with which the epithet is applied to Agni
	3 suggests that there 
is here an allusion to fire burning the primæval forest and 
rendering advance possible. The god Pūṣan is pathi-kṛt, as 
guarding the flocks.
	4 The Ṛṣis,
	5 or seers, as ‘path-makers,’ 
may be compared with the Roman Pontifices. 1) ii. 23, 6; vi. 21, 12; ix. 106, 5; x. 14, 15; 111, 3, etc. 2) Av. xviii. 2, 53; 3, 25, etc. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 1, 1; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 1, 5, 5; xii. 
4, 4, 1; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iv. 3, 
etc. 4) Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, iii. 4, 9; 
xvi. 1, 17. The Sūtra, xvi. 1, 18, ex
plains pathi-kṛt merely as adhipati, 
‘lord’; but the sense must be more 
pregnant than that. 5) Rv. x. 14, 15, where the expression 
refers to their finding the way to the 
heavenly world; but it is probably a 
transfer of an epithet of terrestrial 
application.

पद्
पद्
 in the Atharvaveda (xix. 6, 2) and the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa (xi. 3, 2, 3) denotes a ‘quarter.’ This sense is 
derived from the primary meaning of ‘foot,’ which as applied 
to quadrupeds would represent ‘one-fourth.’ Cf. Pāda.

पद
पद
 in the sense of ‘quarter of a stanza’ is found as early 
as the Rigveda
	1 and often later.
	2 In the Brāhmaṇas it also 
denotes a ‘word’ as opposed to a ‘letter’ (Varṇa).
	3 1) i. 164, 24. 45. 2) Av. ix. 10, 19; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xix. 25; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6. 10. 
17, etc.; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxii. 
1. 5. 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5, where 
the sequence is half-stanza (ardharca), 
quarter-stanza (pāda), word (pada), and 
letter (varṇa). Cf. Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, x. 2, 6, 13; xi. 5, 6, 9, etc.

पदि
पदि
 is found once in the Rigveda,
	1 where, according to the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, the word probably designates some 
kind of animal. Yāska
	2 explains it as equivalent to gantu, 
‘a moving creature,’ but Durga
	3 as meaning ‘bird.’ The 
passage may refer to catching the Padi in a net (? mukṣījā).

पयस्
पयस्
 denotes the ‘milk’ of the cow in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 More generally it has also the sense of ‘sap’ or ‘fluid’ 
found in plants,
	3 and giving them life and strength. In other 
passages it denotes the ‘water’ of heaven.
	4 A vow to live for 
a time on milk alone occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

alone.

पयस्या
पयस्या
 in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas
	1 denotes 
curds, said to consist of a mixture of sour milk and hot or cold 
fresh milk.

परआट्णार
पर आट्णार
 (‘descendant of Aṭṇāra’) appears in the later 
Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 as one of the ancient great 
kings who won sons by performing a particular sacrifice. In 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 he is styled Hairaṇyanābha, ‘de
scendant of Hiraṇyanābha,’ and in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	4 he is called Para Āhlāra Vaideha, a fact testifying to 
the close connexion of Kosala and Videha. A Yajña-gāthā, 
or ‘sacrificial verse,’ there
	5 cited mentions Hiraṇyanābha 
Kausalya in connexion with Para. 1) Taittīrīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3;

परमज्या
परम-ज्या,
 ‘of supreme power,’ is understood by Ludwig
	1 
in one passage of the Rigveda
	2 as the proper name of a great 
man among the Yadus. But it is doubtful whether the word 
is more than an epithet.

परशु
परशु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes the axe of the 
woodcutter. Of its form we know nothing. A red-hot axe 
was used in a form of ordeal (Divya) applied in accusations of 
theft.

परस्वत्|परस्वन्त्
परस्वन्त्
 denotes a large wild animal which Roth
	1 con
jectures to be the wild ass. It is mentioned in the Vṛṣākapi 
hymn
	2 of the Rigveda, twice in the Atharvaveda,
	3 and in the 
list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	4 in all of which passages the sense of 
‘wild ass’ is satisfactory. More doubtful is the meaning of the 
word paraśvā(n) in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,
	5 where the com
mentary explains it as ‘serpent.’ It is, of course, quite possible 
that the word has nothing to do with parasvant. Bühler

परावृज्
परा-वृज्
 is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda,
	1 
in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition, 
while one
	2 of them also speaks of him as going south. Sāyaṇa's
	3 
view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while 
Grassmann's
	4 explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable. 
Roth's
	5 interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the 
passage which refers to the Parāvṛj as going south. Zimmer
	6 
accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees 
a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in 
danger of being eaten by insects (vamrī). This view is sup
ported by the fact that parāvṛkta seems to have the same 
sense,
	7 and is accepted by Oldenberg.

पराशर
पराशर
 is mentioned with Śatayātu and Vasiṣṭha in the 
Rigvedic hymn celebrating Sudās'
	1 victory over the ten kings. 
According to the Nirukta
	2 he was a son of Vasiṣṭha, but the 
Epic version makes him a son of Śakti and grandson of Vasiṣṭha. 
Geldner
	3 thinks that he is mentioned in the Rigveda along with 
Śatayātu, perhaps his uncle, and his grandfather Vasiṣṭha, as 
the three sages who approached Indra and won his favour for 
Sudās. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of 
certain hymns of the Rigveda
	4 by the Anukramaṇī (Index). 1) vii. 18, 21. 2) vi. 30. 3) Vedische Studien, 2, 132. 4) i. 65-73. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 110, 111; Weber, Indische 
Studien, 9, 324. The Parāśaras as a 
school appear in the Kāṭhaka Anu
kramaṇī (Indische Studien, 3, 460).

परिक्षित्
परि-क्षित्
 appears in the Atharvaveda
	1 as a king in whose 
realm, that of the Kurus, prosperity and peace abound. The 
verses in which he is celebrated are later
	2 called Pārikṣityaḥ, 
and the Brāhmaṇas explain that Agni is pari-kṣit because he 
dwells among men. Hence Roth
	3 and Bloomfield
	4 regard 
Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda not as a human king at all. This 
may be correct, but it is not certain. Both Zimmer
	5 and 
Oldenberg
	6 recognize Parikṣit as a real king, a view supported 
by the fact that in the later Vedic literature King Janamejaya 
bears the patronymic Pārikṣita. If this be so, Parikṣit 
belonged to the later period, since the Atharvan passage in 
which his name occurs is certainly late, and none of the other 
Saṃhitās know Parikṣit at all. The Epic
	7 makes him grandfather 
of Pratiśravas and great-grandfather of Pratīpa, and Zimmer,
	5 
probably with justice, compares the Prātisutvana and Pratīpa 
found in another late Atharvan passage.
	8 But Devāpi and 
Śantanu cannot be brought into connexion with Pratīpa.

of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa, and not connected directly 
with Śantanu. Yāska, Nirukta, ii. 10, 
identifies them as brothers and Kurus; 
but the former part of the identification 
is, no doubt, wrong.

परिघ
परि-घ
 denotes an iron bolt or bar in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad (ii. 24, 6. 10. 15) as often later.

परिचक्रा
परि-चक्रा
 is according to one reading the name of a 
Pañcāla town mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and 
identified by Weber
	2 with the later Ekacakrā, which was near 
Kāmpīla.

परिचर
परि-चर
 is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 in the sense 
of ‘attendant.’ In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	2 pari-caraṇa has 
the same sense metaphorically, the other two Vedas (Sāma 
and Yajur) being said to be subsidiary to the Rigveda. 1) iv. 3, 5, 9. Cf. pari-caritṛ, Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vii. 8, 1. 2) vi. 11; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 457.

परिचर्मण्य
परि-चर्मण्य
 denotes a thong of leather in the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa (vi. 12) and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (ii. 1).

परितक्म्या
परि-तक्म्या
 in a number of passages of the Rigveda
	1 
denotes ‘night’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 
Sieg
	2 thinks that in one place
	3 at least the word signifies the 
decisive point of the race, something like the sense of Prapitva. 
But this is very doubtful. 1) i. 116, 15; iv. 41, 6; 43, 3; v. 30, 13; 31, 11; vi. 24, 9; vii. 69, 4. 2) Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 128. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 36; Rigveda,

परिदा
परि-दा
 in a few passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 has 
the sense of ‘giving oneself up to the mercy or protection of 
another.’ 1) ii. 4, 1, 11; ix. 2, 1, 17; 4, 2, 17; 4, 5; 5, 1, 53.

परिधान
परि-धान
 denotes ‘garment,’ probably ‘under garment,’ in 
the Atharvaveda (viii. 2, 16) and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upani
ṣad (vi. 1, 10). A garment of saffron is mentioned in the 
Śānkhāyana Āraṇyaka (xi. 4).

परिपद्
परि-पद्
 seems in the Rigveda
	1 to denote a pitfall used to 
capture lions. 1) x. 28, 10; metaphorically, viii. 24, 24.

परिपन्थिन्
परि-पन्थिन्,
 ‘besetting the path,’ denotes ‘robber’ in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.

परि-पवन
 signifies in the Nirukta (iv. 9. 10) an instrument 
for winnowing grain.

परिमित्
परि-मित्
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda
	1 in the description 
of a house, meaning perhaps the ‘crossbeams’ connecting the 
vertical posts.

परि-मोष
 in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 signifies ‘theft,’ and 
parimoṣin in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 ‘thief.’ 1) ii. 5, 5, 1; vi. 1, 11, 5. 2) xi. 6, 3, 11; xiii. 2, 4, 2, etc.

परिरथ्य
परि-रथ्य
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda
	1 meaning either 
‘road’
	2 or a part of the chariot, perhaps as Ludwig
	3 and 
Whitney
	4 render it, the ‘rim.’ 1) viii. 8, 22. 2) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharva- 
veda, 587, following Nīlakaṇṭha's ex

परिवक्रा
परि-वक्रा
 is the reading accepted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
(xiii. 5, 4, 7) by the scholiast instead of the variant Paricakrā, 
which is supported by the Epic Ekacakrā.

परिवत्सर
परि-वत्सर
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 a ‘full year.’ 
It is often mentioned with other names of year (see Saṃvatsara), 
and in the later five year cycle counts as the second year. 1) x. 62, 2. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa i. 5, 5, 6; 
Mahābhārata, i. 3202, etc. So pari- 
vatsarīṇa, as an adjective, ‘relating to 
a full year,’ Rv. vii. 103, 8; Av. 
iii. 10, 3.

परिवाप
परि-वाप
 in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and Brāhmaṇas

tirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 11, 2, etc.

परिवित्त
परि-वित्त
 denotes an ‘elder brother who is not married 
when his younger brother is.’ The term occurs in the list of 
sinful persons in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 as well as in the 
Atharvaveda,
	2 where Ludwig
	3 needlessly proposes to read 
parivettā, the ‘younger brother who marries before his eldest 
brother.’ The name for the younger brother in the older texts 
is Parivividāna.

परिव्राजक
परि-व्राजक
 (lit., ‘wandering about’) denotes in the Nirukta 
(i. 14; ii. 8) a ‘mendicant monk.’

परिषद्
परि-षद्
 (lit., ‘sitting around’) denotes in the Upaniṣads
	1 an 
‘assemblage’ of advisers in questions of philosophy, and the 
Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra
	2 refers to a teacher with his Pariṣad or 
‘council.’ In the later literature the word denotes a body of 
advisers on religious topics, but also the assessors of a judge, 
or the council of ministers of a prince.
	3 But in none of these 
senses is the word found in the early literature, though the 
institutions indicated by it must have existed at least in 
embryo. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 1 
(Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1 Kāṇva); daivī

परिष्कन्द
परि-ष्कन्द
 (lit., ‘leaping around’) occurs in the Vrātya 
hymn of the Atharvaveda (xv. 2, 1 et seq.) denoting, in the dual, 
the two footmen running beside a chariot.

परिष्यन्द
परि-ष्यन्द
 (with water ‘flowing around’) in two passages 
of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ix. 1, 19; xiv. 3, 1, 14) denotes 
a sandbank or island in a river.

परिसारक
परि-सारक
 is the name of a place, an island formed by the 
Sarasvatī ‘flowing around’ it, according to a story in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (ii. 19).

परिस्रुत्
परि-स्रुत्
 is the name of a drink which is mentioned first in 
the Atharvaveda,
	1 and which was distinct from both Surā and 
Soma,
	2 but was intoxicating. According to Mahīdhara,
	3 the 
liquor was made from flowers (Puṣpa). Zimmer
	4 thinks that 
it was the family drink, and this is supported by the fact that 
in the Atharvaveda it twice occurs as a household beverage.
	5 
Hillebrandt
	6 is of opinion that it was very much the same as 
Surā. 1) iii. 12, 7; xx. 127, 9. Cf. Hopkins,

17, 68. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 2, 14.

xix. 15; xx. 59; xxi. 29; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, iii. 11, 2. Its nature is more 
elaborately explained in the Kātyāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra, xiv. 1, 14; xv. 10, 11; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 349, 350. 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 24, 8.

परीणह्
1. Parī-ṇah appears to denote a ‘box’ or something similar 
in the Atharvaveda (xix. 48, 1).

परीणह्
2. Parī-ṇah is the name of a place in Kurukṣetra mentioned 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,

परी-शास
 is the name of an instrument of the nature of 
tongs, used to lift the sacrificial kettle off the fire.
	1 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 3, 1; 2, 1, 16; 2, 54; 3, 1, 20, etc.

परुच्छेप
परुच्-छेप
 is the name of a Ṛṣi to whom the Anukramaṇī 
(Index) attributes a series of hymns
	1 in the Rigveda, and whose 
authorship is asserted in the Aitareya
	2 and the Kauṣītaki
	3 
Brāhmaṇas, as well as in the Nirukta.
	4 In the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	5 he appears as a rival of Nṛmedhas. 1) Rv. i. 127-139. 2) v. 12. 13 (where hymns Rv. i. 128, 
129, 130, 133, 135, 137, 139, are at
tributed to him). 3) xxiii. 4. 5. 4) x. 42. 5) ii. 5, 8, 3. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 116. Parucchepa's claim to 
authorship is very doubtful.

परुष
परुष
 seems to mean ‘reed’ in the Atharvaveda (viii. 8, 4) 
and ‘arrow’ in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xiv. 22, 20).

परुष्णी
परुष्णी
 is the name of a river which is mentioned in the 
Nadī-stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’),
	1 and in the song of Sudās’ 
victory over the ten kings,
	2 which seems to have been made 
decisive by the rise of the river drowning the fugitives.
	3 In 
these passages and one of the eighth book of the Rigveda,
	4 
where it is called a ‘great stream’ (mahenadi), the name is 
certainly that of the river later called Ravi (Irāvatī), as recog
nized by Yāska.
	5 Pischel
	6 sees a reference to it in two other 
passages of the Rigveda,
	7 where ‘wool’ (ūṛṇā) is connected 
with the word paruṣṇī, and the allusion to the river is accepted 
by Max Müller
	8 and Oldenberg,
	9 though they are not fully 
agreed as to the exact sense of the passages in question. 
Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’ 
(parus) of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood 
by the Nirukta,
	5 or from its reeds, as Roth
	10 suggests. 
The mention of the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā in the hymn 
celebrating the victory of Sudās has given rise to the conjectures 
of Hopkins,
	11 that the Yamunā in that hymn is merely another 
name for the Paruṣṇī, and of Geldner,
	12 that the Paruṣṇī there 
is merely a tributary of the Yamunā (Jumna). But neither 
interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn 
is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two 
great victories of Sudās. There is a doubtful reference to the 
Paruṣṇī in the Atharvaveda.
	13 1) x. 75, 5. 2) vii. 18, 8. 9. 3) It is impossible to decide precisely 
what part the river played in the battle. 
It is usually held that the enemies of 
Sudās tried to divert the stream, but 
failed, and were drowned in its current. 
So Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 11; 
Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature, 154; 
Geldner, Rigveda, Kommentar, 103, holds 
that Sudās was caught between two 
opposing armies, and had to escape 
over the Paruṣṇī, that his enemies 
tried to divert it to render him more 
accessible to their attack, but failed, 
and were overwhelmed in the river. 
Hopkins, India, Old and New, 52 et seq., 
may be right in rejecting in toto the 
theory of the attempted diversion of 
the waters, though in the Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 15, 261 et seq., 
he accepted the traditional view. 4) viii. 74, 15. 5) Nirukta, ix. 26. 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 208-210. 7) iv. 22, 2; v. 52, 9. 8) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 315,

परुस्
परुस्
 means first a ‘limb’ or ‘member’ of the body,
	1 and 
is then applied metaphorically to the divisions of the sacrifice
	2 
or of the year
	3 (cf. Parvan). 1) Rv. i. 162, 18; x. 97, 12; 100, 5;

1. Parṇa denotes the ‘wing’ of a bird in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 It also means the ‘feather’ of an arrow in a late passage 
of the Rigveda,
	3 and more often later;
	4 and the ‘leaf’ of a tree 
from the Rigveda onwards.

पर्ण
2. Parṇa denotes the tree Butea frondosa, later usually called 
Palāśa. It occurs in the Rigveda
	1 in connexion with the 
Aśvattha, and with that tree as well as the Nyagrodha in the 
Atharvaveda,
	2 which mentions both amulets
	3 and the cover of 
sacrificial dishes
	4 as made from its wood. Its use for the 
making of sacrificial implements like the ladle (juhū),
	5 or 
sacrificial posts,
	6 or the small ladle called sruva,
	7 is mentioned. 
The Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	8 ascribes its origin to the loss of a 
feather by the Gāyatrī when winning the Soma. The tree is 
also often mentioned elsewhere.
	9 Reference too is sometimes 
made to its bark (parṇa-valka).

पर्णक
पर्णक
 is the name of a man included in the list of victims 
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā
	1 and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 According to Mahī
dhara,
	3 a Bhilla is meant — i.e., presumably a wild hillman, for 
he glosses Niṣāda in the same way.
	4 Sāyaṇa
	5 explains the 
word as meaning ‘one who catches fish by putting over the 
water a parṇa with poison,’ but this is apparently a mere 
etymological guess. Weber's
	6 rendering of the term as refer
ring to a savage ‘wearing feathers’ is ingenious, but uncertain. 1) xxx. 16. 2) iii. 4, 12, 1. 3) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, loc. cit. 4) On Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 27. 5) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. 6) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen-

पर्णय
पर्णय
 is the name in two passages of the Rigveda
	1 either

पर्यङ्क
पर्य्-अङ्क
 is the name of the seat of the Brahman in the 
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.
	1 It seems to correspond to what is else
where called Āsandi;
	2 as used in the Upaniṣad, it can, how
ever, hardly mean a long seat for reclining on, but rather a 
throne.

पर्यास
पर्य्-आस
 is used in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 1, 2, 18) to 
denote the woof of cloth, the warp being called anuchāda.

पर्वत
1. Parvata in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 is con
joined with giri in the sense of ‘hill’ or ‘mountain.’ From 
the Rigveda
	3 onwards
	4 it is common in this sense as connected 
with the waters of rivers which flow in the hills.
	5 The legend 
of the mountains having wings is already found in the 
Saṃhitās.
	6 In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	7 are mentioned the 
southern (dakṣiṇa) and the northern (uttara) mountains, evidently 
in allusion to the Himālaya and the Vindhya ranges. The 
plants (oṣadhi) and aromatic products (añjana) of the mountains 
are referred to in the Atharvaveda,
	8 and their mineral treasures 
in the Rigveda.

पर्वत
2. Parvata in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 denotes, according 
to Ludwing,
	2 a sacrificer whose generosity is praised. But it is 
probable that the god Parvata, the spirit of the mountain, is 
meant.

पर्वत
3. Parvata is mentioned several times in the Aitareya Brāh

	1 along with Nārada. The Anukramaṇī (Index) attri
butes to him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda.

पर्वन्
पर्वन्
 denotes the knots of the reed or the joints of a plant,
	1 
and more generally a part or limb of the body.
	2 It also 
designates a period of time, probably with reference to the 
breaks in the month at new and full moon.
	3 In one passage
	4 
Geldner
	5 thinks the word indicates a song section of the 
Sāmaveda. 1) Av. xii. 3, 31; Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

पर्शान
पर्शान,
 ‘hollow,’ is mentioned several times in the Rigveda 
(vii. 104, 5; viii. 7, 34; 45, 41).

पर्शु
1. Parśu denotes ‘rib’ in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 Cf. 
Śarīra. 1) ix. 7, 6; x. 9, 20; xi. 3, 12. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 25, 1; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxi. 1; Śatapatha

xii. 3, 1, 6; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 
etc.

पर्शु
2. Parśu seems in some passages
	1 to denote a ‘sickle,’ being 
apparently a variant of Paraśu. 1) Av. xii. 3, 31 (Kauśika Sūtra, i. 24. 
25; viii. 11; lxi. 38. 39); perhaps 
vii. 28, 1 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 
4, 1. See Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 407, 408; Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 26 (where 
parśu is metrically needed), etc. Cf. 
Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.

पर्शु
3. Parśu in the Nirukta
	1 is explained in one passage of the 
Rigveda
	2 as meaning the sides of a cistern (kūpa).
	3 But the 
sense of ‘ribs’ is quite adequate there. 1) iv. 6. 2) i. 105, 8; x. 33, 2. 3) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 100; 
Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 107.

पर्शु
4. Parśu occurs in one passage in a Dānastuti (‘praise of 
gifts’) in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of a man. It is not certain 
that he is identical with Tirindira, but the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	2 mentions Tirindira Pāraśavya as the patron of Vatsa 
Kāṇva. In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn,
	3 
Parśu Mānavī occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of 
Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting 
these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has 
with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda. 
Ludwig,
	4 however, sees in several other places an allusion to 
the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda
	5 he finds a 
reference to the defeat of Kuruśravaṇa by the Parśus; in 
another
	6 he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus — i.e., the 
Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in 
Pārthava, a name found in one hymn.
	7 The same view is 
taken by Weber,
	8 who holds that historical connexions with the 
Persians are referred to. But Zimmer
	9 points out that this 
conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini
	10 
as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west 
Madhyadeśa; and the Periplus
	11 knows a tribe of Parthoi in 
north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that 
the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of 
course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted 
with any degree of probability. 1) viii. 6, 46. 2) xvi. 11, 20. 3) x. 86, 23. Apparently Vārttika 2, 
on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 177, where Parśu is 
explained as a feminine, Princess of 
the Parśus, refers to this passage. On 
the sense, cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 
2, 42; Rigveda, Glossar, 107; and Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 2, 2, where the 
expression occurs, but where the sense 
is very dubious. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 196 
et seq. 5) x. 33, 2. The sense here is, no 
doubt, ‘ribs.’ See Geldner, op. cit., 2, 
184, n. 3; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, 
2, 362, n. 6) vii. 83, 1, pṛthu-parśavaḥ, which 
really means either ‘with large ribs’ — 
i.e., ‘strong,’ as Roth, with Sāyaṇa, 
inclines to take it — or ‘with broad axes,’ 
according to Zimmer. 7) vi. 27, 8. 8) Indische Studien, 4, 379; Indian 
Literature, 4; Episches im vedischen 
Ritual, 36 et seq. He confines his view 
to the equation of Parśu in Rigveda, 
viii. 6, 46, and the Persians. Hille
brandt, who is inclined to see relations 
with Iran in early times (see Paṇi, 
Pārāvata, Sṛñjaya), does not in this 
connexion quote Parśu at all, and, 
though he mentions Pārthava, does not 
regard it as probably referring to a 
Parthian (Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105). 
Brunnhofer, in his various works (Iran 
und Turan, 1889; vom Pontus bis zum 
Indus, 1890, etc.), finds constant refer
ences in the Veda to events in Iran, 
but his theories must be regarded as 
definitely unscientific. See also Hop
kins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 264, n. 9) Altindisches Leben, 134 et seq.; 433. 
Ibid., 434, 435, he refutes conclusively 
Ludwig's extraordinary view that Pṛthu 
and Parśu are dialectical forms of the 
same word. 10) v. 3, 117. 11) c. 38.

पर्ष
पर्ष
 occurs in the Rigveda,
	1 denoting in the plural ‘sheaves’ 
strewn over the threshing floor. Cf. Khala. 1) x. 48, 7; Nirukta, iii. 10. Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 238. Per
haps parṣin, in the compound iṣu-parṣin 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 5, 
means ‘having a bundle (of arrows).’

पलद
पलद
 occurs twice in one hymn of the Atharvaveda
	1 in the 
description of a house. It seems to mean bundles of straw or 
reeds used to thatch the house and render the sides wind and 
weather proof. 1) ix. 3, 5, 17. Cf. Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 194, 195.

पलस्ति
पलस्ति
 See Palita.

पलाल
पलाल
 is found with Anu-palāla in the Atharvaveda (viii. 6, 2) 
as the name of a demon. The meaning of the word is ‘straw,’ 
in which sense it occurs in the Kauśika Sūtra (lxxx. 27), while the 
feminine form, Palālī, is found in the Atharvaveda itself (ii. 8, 3) 
as the straw of barley (Yava).

पलाव
पलाव
 is found in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	2 in the sense of ‘chaff.’ 1) xii. 3, 19, where some manuscripts read palāvā. 2) i. 54, 1

पलाश
पलाश,
 like Parṇa, denotes ‘leaf’ in the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 It 
also
	2 designates the tree Butea frondosa, of which Parṇa is the 
early name. 1) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, x. 2; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 4, 5; v. 2, 1, 
17 etc.; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 
14, 3. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 3, 19; ii. 6, 2, 8, 
etc. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59.

पलित
पलित,
 ‘grey-haired,’ occurs frequently from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards.
	2 It is the distinctive sign of old age. Those who, 
like certain descendants of Jamadagni, do not grow old,
	3 are 
said not to become grey-haired, while Bharadvāja is described 
as having in his old age become thin and grey-haired.
	4 The 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	5 in one passage observes that grey hairs 
appear first on the head, and elsewhere
	6 alludes to the hair on 
the arms having become grey. 1) i. 144, 4; 164, 1; iii. 55, 9; x. 4, 5, 
etc. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15, etc. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 1, 9, 1; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 10, 6. Cf. 
Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut 
Academy of Arts and Sciences, 15, 54, and 
Rv. iii. 53, 16, where palasti seems to 
mean palita. 4) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 49. 5) xi. 4, 1, 6. 14. 6) iii. 8, 2, 25.

पल्पूलन
पल्पूलन
 is found in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	2 apparently meaning, properly, ‘lye,’ or water impreg
nated with some biting substance for washing clothes. In the 
Atharvan passage urine seems to be meant.
	3 The verb palpū- 
laya, ‘to wash with alkaline water,’ occurs in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	2 and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa;
	4 and the Sūtras refer 
to hides (carman)
	5 and garments
	6 so washed. Cf. also Vāsaḥ- 
palpūlī. 1) xii. 4, 9. Cf. Kauśika Sūtra, xi. 16. 2) ii. 5, 5, 6. 3) Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 695. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of 
the Atharvaveda, 74, 175. 2) ii. 5, 5, 6. 4) i. 3, 5, 2. 3. 5) Kauśika Sūtra, 67. 6) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 8, 
12. Cf. Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra. 
i. 6, 13, 15; Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.

पल्लिगुप्तलौहित्य
पल्लि-गुप्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is mentioned 
in a Vaṃśa (‘list of teachers’) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1) as a pupil of Śyāmajayanta Lauhitya. 
The name is obviously a late one, for Palli is not found in the 
early literature, and the name of the Lauhitya family is other
wise known in post-Vedic works only.

पवन
पवन
 (‘purifier’) in the Atharvaveda
	1 denotes an instrument 
for purifying grain from husks, etc.; either a ‘sieve’ or a 
‘winnowing basket’ may be meant. In the Sūtras
	2 it is 
mentioned as used for cleaning the bones of the dead after 
cremation. 1) iv. 34, 2; xviii. 3, 11. Cf. Nirukta, 
vi. 9. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 5, 7.

पवमान
पवमान
 is a term very frequently applied in the Rigveda 
to the Soma ‘purifying itself’ by running through the sieve. 
Later it appears in a few passages
	1 in the sense of ‘wind’ (as a 
purifier). 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 20, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 17; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 7.

पवस्त
पवस्त
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 apparently 
denotes ‘covers.’ 1) iv. 5, 6. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda. 156.

पवि
पवि
 denotes the ‘tire’ of the wheel of a chariot in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 Reference is made
	3 to the necessity for 
fastening it on firmly, and the epithet su-pavi, ‘having a good 
tire,’ is found in the Atharvaveda
	4 with su-nābhi, ‘having a good 
nave,’ and su-cakra, ‘having a good wheel.’ The tires were, of 
course, of metal,
	5 and being sharp,
	6 could serve on occasion as 
weapons.
	7 The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	8 takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the 
stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because 
no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hille
brandt
	9 seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp 
edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda
	10 
are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without 
horses and without chariots’ (anaśvāsaḥ pavayo 'rathāḥ). 
The Nirukta
	11 ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow (śalya), but 
this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for 
this use two passages of the Rigveda,
	12 but in one the secondary 
sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra 
is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression vāṇasya 
pavi occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’
	13 
meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hille
brandt
	14 thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is 
intended. Pavī-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda,
	15 seems to throw no light on this point, for while 
the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is 
like a spearhead,’ it is translated as ‘rim-nosed’ (presumably in 
allusion to the curved shape of the nose) by Whitney.

पवित्र
पवित्र
 denotes in the Rigveda,
	1 and later,
	2 the sieve used 
for purifying the Soma, the only mode of purifying it certainly
	3 known to the Rigveda. It seems clearly
	4 to have been made of 
sheep's wool, whether woven or plaited is not certain, for the 
expressions used are too vague to be decisive, though Zimmer
	5 
thinks hvarāṃsi
	6 points to plaiting. 1) i. 28, 9; iii. 36, 7; viii. 33, 1;

alone or with avyaya, etc. 5) Altindisches Leben, 278, n. 6) ix. 3, 2; 63, 4.

पवीर
पवीर,
 according to the Nirukta,
	1 denotes a ‘lance.’ The 
epithet derived from this word, pavīravant or pavīrava, which is 
found in the Atharvaveda
	2 and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	3 is used 
of the plough, apparently in the sense of ‘having a metal 
share.’ The same epithet occurs in the Rigveda
	4 applied to a 
man, in the sense of ‘having a goad’ or ‘having a spear.’ 1) xii. 30, In Rv. i. 174, 4, pavīrava 
seems to mean ‘thunderbolt.’ 2) iii. 17, 3. 3) Pavīravant, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xii. 71; pavīrava, Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
10, 2, 5, 6; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 
12; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvi. 11. 4) x. 60, 3. 
Cf. Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 116.

पवीरु
पवीरु
 appears in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as a Ruśama, 
being a prince or at least a wealthy noble. 1) viii. 51, 9 = Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 82.

पशु
पशु
 means ‘animal’ generally, including man. There is 
frequent mention
	1 of the five sacrificial animals — the horse, the 
cow, the sheep, the goat, and man. Seven such domestic 
animals are spoken of in the Atharvaveda
	2 and later;
	3 probably, 
as Whitney
	4 observes, merely as a sacred mystic number, not, 
as the commentator
	5 explains, the usual five with the ass and 
the camel added. Animals are also referred to as ubhayadant 
and anyatodant. They are further
	6 classified as those which 
take hold with the hand (hastādānāḥ), man (puruṣa), elephant 
(hastin), and ape (markaṭa), and those which grasp by the mouth 
(mukhādānāḥ). Another division is that of biped (dvipād) and 
quadruped (catuṣpād).
	7 Man is a biped;
	8 he is the first (pra- 
thama) of the beasts;
	9 he alone of animals lives a hundred 
years (śatāyus),
	10 and he is king of the animals.
	11 He possesses 
speech (vāc) in conjunction with the other animals.
	12 In the 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	13 an elaborate distinction is drawn between 
vegetables, animals, and man in point of intellect. 
Of animals apart from man a threefold division is offered in 
the Rigveda
	14 — into those of the air (vāyavya), those of the 
jungle (āraṇya), and those of the village (grāmya), or tame 
animals. The division into āraṇya and grāmya animals is quite 
common.
	15 In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	16 is found a division 
into eka-śapha, ‘whole-hoofed’; kṣudra, ‘small’; and āraṇya, 
‘wild,’ the two former classes denoting the tame animals.
	16 
The horse and the ass are eka-śapha;
	17 the kṣudra are the sheep, 
the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of 
ubhayadant and anyatodant.
	18 Zimmer
	19 sees in a passage of the 
Atharvaveda
	20 a division of wild animals (āraṇya) into five 
classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts 
which are in the wood’ (mṛgā bhīmā vane hitāḥ); (2) winged 
creatures, represented by the Haṃsa, ‘gander,’ Suparṇa, 
‘eagle,’ Śakuna, ‘bird’; (3) amphibia — Śiṃśumāra, ‘alligator,’ 
and Ajagara, ‘crocodile’ (?); (4) ‘fish,’ Purīkaya, Jaṣa, 
and Matsya; (5) insects and worms (described as rajasāḥ). 
But this division is more ingenious than probable, and it is 
ignored by both Bloomfield
	21 and Whitney.

are meant. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 5, 7;

पष्ठवाह्
1. Paṣṭha-vāh occurs in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 meaning 
an ox, four years old, according to the commentators. This 
qualification is, however, very doubtful, for Paṣṭhauhī, ‘cow,’ 
a word occurring quite frequently,
	2 is in one passage
	3 accom
panied by the adjective prathama-garbhāḥ, ‘having a first calf,’ 
which disproves the theory of the age adopted by the com
mentators. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 5, 2; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 9; xviii. 27; 
xxi. 17; xxiv. 13. 28. 29. etc. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā vii. 1, 6, 3;

2. Paṣṭha-vāh is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xii. 5, 11. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

पस्त्यसद्
पस्त्य-सद्
 (‘sitting in the house’) occurs in one passage of 
the Rigveda,
	1 where the sense seems to be ‘inmate,’ ‘com
panion.’ 1) vi. 51, 9. Cf. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 211.

पस्त्या
पस्त्या
 (fem. pl.) is a word occurring in several passages of 
the Rigveda.
	1 Roth
	2 ascribes to it the meaning of ‘house’ or 
‘dwelling,’ in the wide sense of the term, as well as that of the 
‘family’ living in the house; and this view is accepted by 
Zimmer.
	3 On the other hand, Pischel
	4 finds in two of the 
passages
	5 usually referred to Pastyā the neuter Pastya, which 
appears in Pastya-sad and in Pastyā-vant (where the length 
of the second syllable is not primitive), and which is certainly 
found in the Rigveda
	6 in the metaphorical sense of ‘dwelling,’ 
ascribed to it in the Naighaṇṭuka.
	7 In the other passages
	8 he 
thinks the word means ‘rivers’ or ‘waters’; in particular, 
where Soma in the middle of the Pastyās
	9 is spoken of, the 
sees a reference to Kurukṣetra, with its several rivers,
	10 Āpayā, 
Dṛṣadvatī, and Sarasvatī (cf. 2. Pastyāvant). In some passages
	11 
he sees in Pastyā the proper name of a stream, just as Sindhu 
primarily means ‘river,’ then the ‘Indus.’ 1) Rv. i. 25, 10; 40, 7; 164, 30; iv, 1, 
11; vi, 49, 9; vii. 97, 5; ix, 65, 23; 
x. 46, 6. See also iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5, 
where Pastyā appears as a goddess. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 149. Cf. Weber, 
Über den Rājasūya, 43, n. 4; 63. 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 211-22. So 
Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 107. 5) vi. 49. 9; vii. 97, 5, where the 
sense is ‘householder’ (gṛha-stha or 
gṛhin, as Sāyaṇa renders it). 6) x. 96, 10. 11. In x. 96, 10, Roth 
takes pastyoḥ to denote the two parts of 
the Soma press, but Pischel, 2, 211, 
accepts Sāyaṇa's rendering ‘heaven 
and earth.’ In the compounds tri- 
pastya of Agni, Rv. viii. 39, 8; vāja- 
pastya of Pūṣan, vi. 58, 2, of Soma, 
ix. 98, 12; and vīra-pastya, v. 50, 4, the 
primitive word may very well be pastya, 
not pastyā. 7) iii. 4, misquoted by Sāyaṇa on 
Rv. i. 151, 2, as applying to pastyā, 
whereas it really refers to pastya. 8) Rv. i. 25, 10 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
i. 8, 16, 1 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 6, 2; 
ii. 6, 12; 7, 16; iv. 4, 6 = Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, x. 27; Rv. i. 40, 7; 164, 30 
(used of Agni's home); iv. 1, 11; 
ix. 65, 23; x. 46, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
i. 8, 12, 1 = Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 8 
= Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 7. 9) Rv. ix. 65, 23. 10) Rv. iii. 23, 4. 11) Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5; and in 
pastyāvant in ix. 97, 18.

पस्त्यावत्|पस्त्यावन्त्
1. Pastyā-vant, explained in the Pada text as Pastya-vant, 
occurs in several passages of the Rigveda. In two of them
	1 
a rich householder seems meant, and in the two others reference 
to a ‘house’ is clear.
	2 1) i. 151, 2; ix. 97, 18; but the latter 
passage is explained by Pischel as 
referring to Pastyā, the river, and by 
Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., as ‘kept in 
the stall.’ 2) Barhis, Rv. ii. 11, 16, ‘of the house’; kṣayān pastyāvataḥ, iv. 54, 5, 
‘abodes having (fixed) habitations.’ 
Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 212.

पस्त्यावत्|पस्त्यावन्त्
2. Pastyā-vant occurs in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 in the 
locative parallel with Suṣoma, Śaryaṇāvant, and Ārjīka. It 
must apparently denote a place, as Pischel
	2 argues, probably 
corresponding to the locality ‘in the middle of the streams’ 
(madhye pastyānām), elsewhere
	3 referred to as the home of Soma. 
Pischel
	4 suggests that Patiāla is meant, though he does not lay 
any stress on the similarity of name. In the north of Patiāla 
there are hills where the Soma might have grown. Roth
	5 
thought that something connected with the Soma press was 
meant. 1) viii. 7, 29. 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 209. 3) Rv. ix. 65, 23. 4) Op. cit., 2, 219. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. 
Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 
32, 260, 398, 399, takes Pastyāvant 
as a place-name, but thinks that pastyā 
denotes ‘hamlet,’ or, as an epithet of 
Aditi, refers to her as a ‘housewife’ 
(Rv. iv. 55, 3; viii. 27, 5).

पांसु
पांसु
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘dust’ or 
‘sand,’ usually in the plural. Among the portents enumerated 
in the Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa
	3 is a rain of dust or sand (pāṃsu- 
varṣa), a phenomenon not rare in India.
	4 1) vii. 109, 2; xii. 1, 26. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 10, 2; 
Nirukta, xii. 19, etc. 3) vi. 8 (Indische Studien, 1, 40). Cf. 
Varāhamihira, Bṛhatsaṃhitā, xxii. 6. 4) The adjective pāṃsura is found in 
Rv. i. 22, 17, with a variant, pāṃsula, 
Sāmaveda, i. 3, 1, 3, 9. Cf. Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 1, 9.

पाकदूर्वा
पाक-दूर्वा
 is, in a verse of the Rigveda,
	1 included with 
Kiyāmbu and Vyalkaśā among the plants used for growing on 
the spot where the corpse of the dead man has been consumed 
with fire.
	2 The verse is repeated in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	3 
with the variant Kyāmbu. In the Atharvaveda
	4 the word is 
read Śāṇḍadūrvā. Pākadūrvā is probably, as Sāyaṇa-under
stands it, paripakva-dūrvā, ‘ripe or edible millet.’ Śāṇḍadūrvā 
is explained by the commentator
	5 in various ways, as millet 
‘having egg-shaped roots’ (i.e., sāṇḍa, not śāṇḍa), or as ‘having 
long joints,’ with the additional remark that it was called bṛhad- 
dūrvā, ‘large millet.’ In the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, on the other 
hand, the commentary explains Pākadūrvā as small millet. 1) x. 16, 13. 2) See Bloomfield, American Journal 
of Philology, 11, 342-350; Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 15, xxxix. 3) vi. 4, 1, 2. 4) xviii. 3, 6. 5) Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 850.

पाकस्थामन्कौरयाण
पाक-स्थामन् कौरयाण
 is celebrated as a generous donor 
 in a hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 Ludwig
	2 suggests, without much 
reason, that he may have been a king of the Anus. 1) viii. 3, 21. 24. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160.

पाकरु
पाकरु
 is mentioned as a disease, together with Viṣūcikā 
and Arśas, ‘hæmorrhoids,’ in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	1 Its 
nature is unknown; the etymology
	2 points to the sense of 
‘developed sores,’ ‘ulcers.’ 1) xii. 97 Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 393. 2) From pāka, ‘maturity,’ and aru = 
arus, ‘sore.’

पाङ्क्त्र
पाङ्क्त्र
 is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of 
victims at the Aśvamedha, or ‘horse-sacrifice,’ in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās.
	1 The ‘field-rat’ seems to be meant. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 7; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 26. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 85.

पाञ्चजन्य
पाञ्च-जन्य,
 ‘relating to the five peoples.’ See Pañcajanāḥ.

पाञ्चाल
पाञ्चाल
 means a ‘king of the Pañcāla people,’ and is applied 
to Durmukha in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 and to Śoṇa in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 The term is also found in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	3 See also Pañcāla. 1) viii. 23. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 7. 3) iii. 29, 1. Cf. Kāṭhaka Anukramaṇī 
in Indische Studien, 3 460.

पाञ्चि
पाञ्चि,
 ‘descendant of Pañcan,’ is the name of a teacher 
mentioned with disapproval in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) i. 2, 5, 9; ii. 1, 4, 27. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 434.

पाटव
पाटव,
 ‘descendant of Paṭu,’ is a patronymic of Cākra in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 8, 1, 17; 9, 3, 1).

पाटा
पाटा
 is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and in the Kauśika 
Sūtra.
	2 It is assumed by the commentator to be identical 
with the later Pāṭhā, the plant Clypea hernandifolia, which was 
much used medicinally, and is still so used at the present day 
according to Roth.
	3 Very possibly the word should be read as 
Pāṭhā. 1) ii. 27, 4. 2) xxxvii. 1; xxxviii. 18. Cf. Ṛgvi
dhāna, iv. 12, 1. 3) Quoted in Whitney, Translation

पाणिघ्न
पाणि-घ्न,
 ‘hand-clapper,’ is enumerated among the list of 
victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajur
veda.
	1 Presumably a man who drives away birds from the 
fields by making a noise is intended. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 20; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 15, 1.

पाण्ड्व
पाण्ड्व
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 3, 5, 21) denotes an 
uncoloured woollen garment.

पातल्य
पातल्य
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 meaning 
some part of the chariot. What it was is quite uncertain. 
Hopkins
	2 suggests that, as in the Epic, it was possibly a piece 
of wood on the axle to hold the pole of the car. 1) iii. 53, 17. 2) Journal of the American Oriental 
Socicty, 13, 242, 243; 20, 224. Cf. Zim

पात्र
पात्र,
 primarily a ‘drinking vessel’ (from pā, ‘to drink’) 
denotes a vessel generally both in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 It 
was made either of wood
	3 or clay.
	4 In some passages
	5 the 
word is, according to Roth, used to indicate a measure. The 
feminine Pātrī occasionally occurs
	6 in the sense of ‘vessel.’ 1) i. 82, 4; 110, 5; 162, 13 (to hold 
the broth from the flesh of the horse); 
175, 1; ii. 37, 4; vi. 27, 6, etc. 2) Av. iv. 17, 4; vi. 142, 1; ix. 6, 17;

v. 8, 2. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271.

पाथ्य
पाथ्य,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 is 
either an epithet meaning ‘being in heaven’ (pāthas), or a 
patronymic, as Sāyaṇa interprets it, of Vṛṣan. 1) vi. 16, 15. Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 2, 4; Max Müller, Sacred Books 
of the East, 32, 153.

पाद
1. Pāda in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes the ‘foot’ of 
an animal, a bird, and other creatures. 1) xiv. 1, 60. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5. 12; 
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 3, 6, etc.; 
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 5.

पाद
2. Pāda, as a measure of length, denotes ‘foot’ in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The term is occasionally
	2 used to express 
a measure of weight. As a fraction it means a ‘quarter,’ a 
sense derived from that of ‘foot’ of a quadruped (just as śapha, 
the divided hoof, comes to mean an ‘eighth’). 
^3) Rv. x. 90, 3. 4. 1) vi. 5, 3, 2; vii. 2, 1, 7; viii. 7, 2, 
17; Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 10, 
etc. 2) Nirukta, ii. 7; Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad, iii. 1, 2.

पाद
3. Pāda is the regular expression for a ‘quarter verse’ in the 
Brāhmaṇas.
	1 This sense is merely a limitation of ‘quarter’ = 
the ‘foot’ of a quadruped 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 4; Kauṣī
aki Brāhmaṇa, xxvi. 5; Nirukta, vii. 9; 
xi. 6; Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, i. 2, 1; 
x. 6, 9, etc.

पान
पान,
 ‘drink,’ occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the 
Upaniṣads.
	2 1) xiii. 4, 2, 17. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 
43; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 2, 7, 
etc.

पान्त
पान्त
 occurs several times in the Rigveda,
	1 apparently
	2 
meaning ‘drink,’ ‘beverage’ (cf. Pāna). Geldner,
	3 however, 
thinks that in one passage^4 Pānta is the name of a prince. 1) i. 122, 1; 155, 1; viii. 92, 1; ix. 
65, 28 (a very doubtful passage); x. 
88, 1. 2) So Nirukta, vii. 25; Roth, St.

	1 denotes a ‘vessel 
for washing the feet.’ 1) iii. 8, 2, 1; 9, 3, 27; xiii. 5, 2, 1.

पापयक्ष्म
पाप-यक्ष्म
 See Yakṣma.

पापसम
पाप-सम,
 a ‘bad season,’ is in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 
opposed to Puṇya-sama, a ‘good season.’ 1) iii. 3, 8, 4. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 342.

पामन्
पामन्
 occurs in the Atharvaveda
	1 as the name of a skin 
disease. The derivative adjective, Pāmana, ‘suffering from 
skin disease,’ is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 
Since it is mentioned as an accompaniment of fever, probably 
a cutaneous eruption or scab consequent on fever is meant. 1) v. 22, 12. Cf. for the reading, 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 261. See also Chāndogya Upani

पायु
1. Pāyu, meaning ‘guard,’ ‘protector,’ occurs several times 
in the Rigveda.
	1 1) i. 147, 3; ii. 1, 7; iv. 2, 6; 4, 3. 12; vi. 15, 8; viii. 18, 2; 60, 19; x, 100, 9.

पायु
2. Pāyu is found in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of a poet, a 
Bhāradvāja. In the Bṛhaddevatā
	2 he is credited with assisting 
Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna and Prastoka Sārṅjaya by conse
crating their weapons with a hymn.
	3 1) vi. 47, 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 128. 2) v. 124 et seq., with Macdonell's notes. 3) vi. 75 (the ‘battle’ hymn).

पार
पार,
 in accordance with its derivation (pṛ, ‘bring across’), 
denotes the ‘farther bank’ of a river or stream, in which sense
	1 
it occurs in the Rigveda
	2 and later.
	3 1) It also often has the generalized 
sense of ‘extreme limit’ or ‘end,’ as 
in i. 92, 6 (tamasas, ‘of darkness’); 
v. 54, 10 (adhavanaḥ, ‘of a road’). 2) i. 121, 13 (nāvyānām, ‘of streams’); 
viii. 96, 11 (nadīnām); i. 167, 2 (samud- 
rasya); x. 155, 3 (sindhoḥ), etc. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 1, 2. 3; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiii. 5; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 2, 4 (salilasya); 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21 (pāra-kāma, 
‘desiring the farther bank’), etc.

पारशव्य
पारशव्य,
 ‘descendant of Paraśu,’ is the patronymic of 
Tirindira in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Śūtra (xvi. 11, 20). Cf. 
Parśu.

पारावत
1. Pārāvata occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’), in the Yajurveda,
	1 meaning ‘turtle-dove.’ 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25.

पारावत
2. Pārāvata occurs in several passages of the Rigveda. 
Roth
	1 thinks that in most places
	2 it means ‘coming from a 
distance,’ but in two passages
	3 he regards it as the proper 
name of a people on the Yamunā (Jumna). It is certain that 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa the Pārāvatas are a people on 
that river (cf. Turaśravas). Hillebrandt
	4 sees in all the 
passages
	5 the name of a people, comparing the  of 
Ptolemy,
	6 who apparently were settled on the northern border 
of Gedrosia, or the , who were found in 
	7 He 
suggests that they were originally ‘mountaineers’ (Cf. Parvata). 
Ludwig
	8 holds a similar view, and Geldner
	9 recognizes a people 
as meant. The mention of the Sarasvatī in connexion with 
the Pārāvatas
	2 in the Rigveda accords generally with their 
position on the Yamunā in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

पाराशर्य,
 ‘descendant of Parāśara,’ is mentioned in the 
first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad as a pupil of Jātūkarṇya
	1 or of Bhāradvāja.
	2 A 
Pārāśarya is also mentioned as a pupil of Baijavāpāyana,

	1 as a pupil of 
Pārāśarya. 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 (Mādhyaṃdina = ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3, Kāṇva).

पारिकुट
पारिकुट
 is an obscure word — probably corrupt — occurring 
in a verse cited in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 22, 7), and 
apparently meaning ‘attendant.’

पारिक्षित
पारिक्षित,
 ‘descendant of Parikṣit,’ is the patronymic of 
Janamejaya in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.
	2 The Pārikṣitīya appear in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	3 and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	4 as performers of the 
horse sacrifice. In a Gāthā there cited they are called Pāri
kṣitas. Apparently they were the brothers of Janamejaya, named 
Ugrasena, Bhīmasena, and Śrutasena. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad
	5 the question whither they have gone is made the 
subject of a philosophical discussion. It is clear that the family 
had passed away before the time of the Upaniṣad, and it is also 
clear that there had been some serious scandal mingled with 
their greatness which they had, in the opinion of the Brahmins, 
atoned for by their horse sacrifice with its boundless gifts to 
the priests. Weber
	6 sees in this the germ of the Epic stories 
which are recorded in the Mahābhārata. 
The verses relating to Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda
	7 are called 
Pārikṣityaḥ in the Brāhmaṇas.

पारिप्लव
पारि-प्लव,
 ‘cyclic,’ is a term applied to the Ākhyāna, or 
‘tale,’ which is to be recited at the Aśvamedha (‘horse 
sacrifice’), and to be repeated at intervals throughout the year. 
It is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and in the 
Sūtras.

 denotes household utensils' in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā,
	1 where it is said that the wife (patnī), as mistress of 
the house, has charge of all these.

variant form of pāri-ṇāhya in Manu, 
ix. 11.

पारूष्ण
पारूष्ण,
 occurring in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 appears to 
mean some kind of bird. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 24.

of Nigada in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 443.

पार्थव
पार्थव,
 ‘descendant of Pṛthu,’ occurs once in the Rig
veda,
	1 where the Pārthavas are mentioned as generous donors. 
The passage is somewhat obscure, as there is a reference
	2 to a 
defeat of the Turvaśas and the Vṛcīvants by Sṛñjaya Daiva- 
vāta, followed in the next verse by the praise of the bounty to 
the singer of Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna, who was clearly a 
Pārthava, and who, in the earlier part of the hymn, has been 
referred to as victorious over Varaśikha. It is uncertain 
whether, as Zimmer
	3 suggests, the two princes, Abhyāvartin 
Cāyamāna and Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, are identical or not.
	4 That 
Pārthava has any direct connexion with the Parthians, as held 
by Brunnhofer, is most improbable.

 ‘descendant of Pṛthu-śravas,’ is found as 
the name of a demon in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) iv. 26, 15. This form of the name 
is supported by its occurrence in the 
Kauśika Sūtra, ix. 10; xvii. 27. But

पार्थ्य,
 ‘descendant of Pṛthi,’ is the patronymic of some

पिङ्गा
पिङ्गा
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,

	2 thinks that a musical 
instrument of some kind is meant. 1) viii. 69, 9. 2) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 144, n.

पिजवन
पिजवन
 is the name of the father of Sudās according to the 
Nirukta.
	1 Probably this statement is based on a mere con
jecture from the epithet Paijavana used of Sudās in a verse of 
the Rigveda,
	2 but may very well be correct. 1) ii. 24. 2) vii. 18, 19. So Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 21.

पिञ्जूल
पिञ्जूल
 denotes a ‘bundle’ of grass or stalks, especially of 
Darbha. The word is only found in the Brāhmaṇa style.
	1 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1; Aitareya

rence.
	1 1) Av. vi. 112, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 4, 4.

पितापुत्रीय
पिता-पुत्रीय
 (‘relating to father and son’), used with Sam
pradāna (‘handing over’) means the ceremony by which a 
father, when about to die, bequeathes his bodily and mental 
powers to his son. It is described in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.
	1 1) ii. 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 408.

पितामह
पिता-मह,
 beside Tatāmaha, denotes from the Atharvaveda 
onwards
	1 the ‘paternal grandfather,’ apparently as a ‘father in 
a higher sense.’
	2 The great-grandfather is Prapitāmaha and 
Pratatāmaha.
	3 It is significant that there are no corrésponding 
Vedic words for maternal grandparents, and that the words 
used in the latter language, such as Mātāmaha, are imitations 
of the terms for paternal relations. 
In one passage of the Rigveda
	4 Delbrück
	5 suggests that 
mahe pitre means ‘grandfather,’ a sense which would well suit 
the napātam, ‘grandson,’ following, but the sense of the whole 
passage is uncertain.
	6 
We learn very little from the texts of the position of grand
parents. No doubt they were entitled to marks of respect 
similar to those shown to parents,
	7 as the epic expressly 
testifies. A grandfather might easily be the head of the family, 
or be living with his eldest son, after he ceased to be able to 
control the family. 
The grandmother (Pitāmahī) is not mentioned in the extant 
Vedic literature. 1) Av. v. 5, 1; ix. 5, 30; xi. 1, 19; 
xviii. 4, 35; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 
5, 1; vii. 2, 7, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xix. 36; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 
5, 4. 2) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Ver- 
wandtschaftsnamen, 474. 3) Av. xviii. 4, 75. 4) vi. 20. 11. 5) Ibid., 473. 6) See Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2, 128, 
n. 1. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v., also doubts the view which is 
accepted by Delbrück, and denies 
that in Rv. i. 71, 5, the sense of 
‘grandfather’ can be found. 7) Delbrück, op. cit., 480, citing 
Mahābhārata, ii. 1634.

पितु
पितु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 has the general sense of 
‘nutriment,’ whether food or drink. 1) i. 61, 7; 132, 6; 187, 1; vi. 20, 4, 
etc. 2) Av. iv. 6, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
v. 7, 2, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 20; 
xii. 65; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 13.

पितृ
पितृ,
 common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’ 
not so much as the ‘begetter’ (janitṛ),
	1 but rather as the pro
tector of the child, this being probably also the etymological 
sense of the word.
	2 The father in the Rigveda
	3 stands for all 
that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father,
	4 
while Indra is even dearer than a father.
	5 The father carries 
his son in his arms,
	6 and places him on his lap,
	7 while the child 
pulls his garment to attract attention.
	8 In later years the son 
depends on his father for help in trouble,
	9 and greets him 
with joy.
	10 
It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was 
subject to parental control, and how long such control con
tinued. Reference is made in the Rigveda
	11 to a father's 
chastising his son for gambling, and Ṛjrāśva is said to have 
been blinded by his father.
	12 From the latter statement 
Zimmer
	13 infers the existence of a developed patria potestas, but 
to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would 
be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the patria potestas 
was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis 
in the Roman patria potestas. If there is no proof that a father 
legally controlled his son's wedding,
	14 and not much that he 
controlled his daughter's,
	15 the fact is in itself not im
probable. 
There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when 
grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife 
becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he 
set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor 
do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land 
on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such 
property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate 
of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor 
and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact 
that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property,
	16 
or he might divide it amongst them,
	17 and that when the 
father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's 
wife.
	18 There are also obscure traces that in old age a father 
might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that 
this was usual in Vedic India.
	19 
Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience.
	20 
The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he 
owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his 
father's food.
	21 On the other hand, the father was expected 
to be kind. The story of Śunaḥśepa in the Aitareya Brāh 
maṇa
	22 emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless 
treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads
	23 insist on the 
spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son
	24 
was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature 
years. 
On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible.
	25 
It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but 
when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a 
person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's 
adoption of Śunaḥśepa.
	26 It is not clear that adoption from 
one caste into another was possible, for there is no good 
evidence that Viśvāmitra was, as Weber
	27 holds, a Kṣatriya 
who adopted a Brāhmaṇa. Adoption was also not always in 
high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the 
Vasiṣṭha book of the Rigveda
	28 condemns the usage. It was 
also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons, 
to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice 
appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda
	29 
as interpreted by Yāska.
	30 Moreover, it is possible that the 
difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband
	31 may have 
been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to 
make her a Putrikā, the later technical name for a daughter 
whose son is to belong to her father's family. 
There can be no doubt that in a family the father took 
precedence of the mother.
	32 Delbrück
	33 explains away the 
apparent cases to the contrary.
	34 There is no trace of the 
family as a land-owning corporation.
	35 The dual form Pitarau 
regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’
	36 1) Pitā janitā, is used of gods in the 
Rigveda — e.g., iv. 17, 12. 2) As derived from pā, ‘protect.’ 
But, as Böhtlingk and Roth, St. Peters
burg Dictionary, s.v. Mātar, footnote, 
suggest, pa and mā were probably the 
much older original onomatopoetic 
names for ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ which 
in a later reflective age influenced the 
formation of pitṛ and mātṛ (which them
selves go back to the Indo-European 
period). 3) See, e.g., iv. 17, 17; viii. 86, 4. 4) Rv. x. 7, 3. 5) Rv. vii. 32, 19; viii. 1, 6. 6) Rv. i. 38, 1. 7) Rv. v. 43, 7. 8) Rv. iii. 53, 2. 9) In Rv. x. 48, 1, the jantavaḥ possibly 
are the sons. 10) Rv. vii. 103, 3. Cf. 1, 24, 1. 11) Rv. ii. 29, 5. 12) Rv. i. 116, 16; 117, 17. There is 
also the case of the sale of Sunaḥśepa, 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 12-18; and 
cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 3, 3. 13) Altindisches Leben, 316. 14) Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 576. Ibid., 582, 
he quotes Mahābhārata, xii. 6108 et seq., 
which refers in one line to the control 
of the marriage of the son by the father, 
and in the next to a case of free marriage. 
The fact is, no doubt, that the son 
could marry freely, unless his father 
had arranged matters for him when he 
was too young to object. 15) Zimmer, op. cit., 309, assumes this 
as certain, but it is far from proved. 
See, however, Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 2, which is in 
favour of Zimmer's view. Cf. Kaegi, 
Dev Rigveda, 15, and Pati. 16) Rv. i. 70, 10; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,

exposure, and the second merely refers 
to the exposure of a dead body; but

difficulties, but they are of no im
portance for Vedic times proper. 35) Baden Powell, whose various 
works (Indian Village Community, 1896; 
Village Communities in India, 1899, etc.) 
have done most to combat the view of 
the village community in India as a 
land-holding institution, is prepared to 
recognize the family as a land-owning 
unit, considering that the patria potestas 
is a later growth, and not Indian (see, 
e.g., Village Communities in India, 128 
et seq.). Hopkins, India, Old and New, 
218 et seq., adopts a theory which allows 
of individual and joint family owner
ship side by side, the latter being 
apparently the earlier but the decadent 
stage. He expressly considers (p. 222) 
that the son had an indefeasible right to 
prevent the father from alienating the 
hereditary land, which could only be 
parted with by the consent of the village 
if it were a case of joint ownership 
(cf. the verse cited by Jolly, Recht und 
Sitte, 94). But it must be remembered 
that, as is very clearly shown in the 
case of English law by Pollock and 
Maitland (History of English Law, 2, 
337-352), the recognition of the rights 
of sons may well be, not a sign of 
original joint or family ownership, but 
a development from the existence of 
intestate succession, and as in England, 
so in India, there is no trace of a 
corporate joint family in the early 
books. And, as Jolly (op. cit., 76, 80) 
shows, there are clear traces, both in 
old and modern times, of a despotic 
control of the family by the father even 
after his sons grew up, provided only 
that he was physically able to control 
them. The same state of affairs seems 
proved for early English law, as it is 
beyond question for Roman law (see 
Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, 2, 351 
et seq.). In Greece also, which is some
times contrasted with Rome, there is 
the clearest trace of both a real patria 
potestas, and of the absolute ownership 
of the land by the father as against 
the son, especially in the archaic laws 
of Gortyn (see Gardner and Jevons, 
Greek Antiquities, 404, 405, 563, 566). 36) Rv. i. 20, 4; 160, 3; ii. 17, 7;

पितृयाण
पितृ-याण,
 the ‘way of the fathers,’ mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and later,
	2 is opposed to the Deva-yāna, or ‘way of the gods.’ 
Tilak
	3 considers that the Devayāna corresponds with the 
Uttarāyaṇa, ‘northern journey’ of the sun, and the Pitṛyāṇa 
with the Dakṣiṇāyana, its ‘southern journey.’ He concludes 
from a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	4 where three of 
the seasons — spring, summer, and the rains — are ascribed to 
the gods, but the others to the Pitṛs, or Fathers, that the 
Devayāna began with the vernal equinox, and the Pitṛyāṇa 
with the autumnal equinox. With this he connects the curious 
distinction of Devaand Yama-Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa.
	5 These conclusions are, however, very improbable. 
Cf. Nakṣatra and Sūrya. 1) x. 2, 7. Cf. the allusion to it in 
x. 18, 1, as other than the Devavāna, 
which appears in x. 98, 11. 2) Av. viii. 10, 19; xii. 2, 10, etc.;

पित्र्य
पित्र्य
 occurs in the list of sciences given in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad.
	1 Apparently it is to be taken as the science relating 
to the cult of the Manes, as explained by Śaṅkara in his 
commentary. As it is in that list followed by Rāśi, the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary is inclined to take Pitrya Rāśi as one 
expression, but in what exact sense does not appear. 1) vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267; Little, Gram-

पित्व
पित्व
 
	1 or Pidva
	2 is the name of an animal included in 
the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās. According to the commentator on the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 it means ‘lion.’ But it may be identical 
with Petva. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 17, 1. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 13;

पिन्वन
पिन्वन
 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 1, 2, 17; 
2, 1, 11; 3, 1, 22) as the name of a vessel used in the ritual.

पिपील
पिपील,
 ‘ant,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda (x. 16, 6) as eating 
the flesh of the dead.

पिपीलिका
पिपीलिका
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes an ‘ant,’ 
the form of the word referring doubtless not so much to the 
small species of ant, as it is taken in the later lexicons,
	3 but 
rather to the insect's tiny size, which would naturally be 
expressed by a diminutive formation of the name. The form 
Pipīlaka
	4 is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.

पिप्पल
पिप्पल,
 n., is found in two passages of the Rigveda
	1 meaning 
‘berry,’ used with a mystic signification, and in neither case 
with any certain reference to the berry of the fig-tree.
	2 In the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	3 the general sense of ‘berry’ is not 
necessary, and the special sense of ‘berry’ of the Peepal is 
quite possible: the latter meaning is perhaps intended in the 
Satapatha Brāhmana.
	4 In the Atharvaveda
	5 the feminine 
form of the word, Pippalī, appears denoting berries used as a 
remedy for wounds, like Arundhatī.
	6 1) i. 164, 20 = Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, 
iii. 1, 1; Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad, iv. 6, 
22; v. 54, 12 (the ‘berry’ of heaven, 
nāka). 2) The word Pippala appears in the 
later literature as a masculine, denoting 
the Ficus veligiosa (Aśvattha in Vedic 
literature). 3) iv. 1, 41. 4) iii. 7, 1, 12. 5) vi. 109, 1, 2. 6) Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 61; Hymns

पिप्पलाद
पिप्पलाद
 (‘eater of berries’) is the name of a teacher 
mentioned in the Praśna Upaniṣad.

पिप्रु
पिप्रु
 is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda. He 
was repeatedly defeated by Indra for Ṛjiśvan.
	1 Mentioned as 
possessing forts,
	2 he is called a Dāsa
	3 as well as an Asura.
	4 
He is described as having a black brood,
	5 and as being allied 
with blacks.
	6 It is uncertain whether he was a demon, accord
ing to Roth's
	7 view, which is favoured by the use of the word 
Asura, or a human foe, as Ludwig,
	8 Oldenberg,
	9 and Hillebrandt
	10 
believe. The name may mean ‘resister,’ from the root pṛ. 1) i. 101, 1, 2; iv. 16, 13; v. 29, 11;

पिश
पिश
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where Sāyaṇa 
takes it to mean a deer (ruru). 1) i. 64, 8. Cf. Av. xix. 49, 4;

officiating at the snake festival mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Cf. Caka. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

पिशाच
पिशाच
 is the name of a class of demon mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 they are 
associated with Rakṣases and Asuras, while opposed to gods, 
men, and fathers. In the Atharvaveda
	4 they are described as 
kravyād, ‘eaters of raw flesh,’ which may be the etymological 
sense of the word Piśāca itself.
	5 It is possible that the Piśācas 
were, as suggested by Grierson,
	6 really human foes, like the 
north-western tribes, who even in later times were reputed 
eaters of raw flesh (not necessarily as cannibals, but rather as 
eaters of human flesh in ritual). This is, however, not at all 
likely, the Piśācas having in all probability only meant ‘ghouls’ 
originally: when they appear as human tribes, they were 
presumably thus designated in scorn. A science called Piśāca
veda
	7 or Piśāca-vidyā
	8 is known in the later Vedic period. 1) ii. 18, 4; iv. 20, 6. 9; 36, 4; 37, 
10; v. 29, 4. 5. 14; vi. 32, 2; viii. 2, 
12; xii. 1, 50. The word occurs once 
in the Rv. (i. 133, 5) in the form of 
Piśāci. 2) See St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) ii. 4, 1, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,

पिशित
पिशित
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes raw flesh 
(of. Piśāca). In one passage of the Atharvaveda
	3 the sense 
seems to be ‘small piece,’ ‘bit,’ but the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary suggests that Piśita here stands for piṣita, equivalent 
to piṣṭa (what is ‘pounded,’ then ‘particle’). 1) v. 19, 5. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11; Kauśika 
Sūtra, xii. 8; xxxv. 18; xxxix. 14. etc. 3) vi. 127, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 531; Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376.

पिशील
पिशील
 is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (ii. 5, 3, 6) as the 
name of a wooden vessel or dish. In the Lāṭyāyana Śrautā 
Sūtra (iv. 2, 4. 5) a Piśīla-vīṇā is mentioned, which seems to 
have been a kind of guitar, with strings stretched over a body 
of wood.

पिशुन
पिशुन,
 ‘traitor,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and occa
sionally later.
	2 1) vii. 104, 20. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 13; Chān

पिष्ट
पिष्ट
 (‘pounded’), n., ‘meal,’ ‘flour,’ is mentioned in the 
Brāhmaṇas.
	1 In the Atharvaveda
	2 reference is made to 
pounded beans (māṣāḥ). 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9; Śatapatha Brāhṃaṇa, i. 1, 4, 3; 2, 1, 2; vi. 
5, 1, 6, etc. 2) xii. 2, 53.

पीठ
पीठ,
 ‘stool,’ does not occur as an uncompounded word 
before the Sūtras, but the compound pīṭha-sarpin (‘moving 
about in a little cart’) is found as the designation of a ‘cripple’ 
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxx. 21) and the Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa (iii. 4, 17, 1) in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’).

पीतुदारु
पीतु-दारु
 is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	1 and later
	2 
denoting the Deodar (deva-dāru) tree, or, according to others, 
the Khadira or Udumbara tree.
	3 Cf. Pūtadru. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 6. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 5, 2, 15;

पीयूष
पीयूष
 is found in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 in the sense of 
the first milk of the cow after calving, ‘biestings.’ Usually 
the term is applied metaphorically to the sap of the Soma 
plant.
	3 1) Cf. ii. 35, 5, where it is applied 
figuratively to the mothers of Agni. 2) Kauśika Sūtra, xix. 15. Cf. Av.

Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 110.

पीला
पीला
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda
	1 as the name of an 
 Apsaras, being no doubt originally a name of some fragrant 
plant, like Naladī and Guggulū, two other names of Apsarases 
given in the same verse. 1) iv. 37, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 69; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 211.

पीलु
पीलु
 is the name in the Atharvaveda
	1 of a tree (Careya arborea 
or Salvadora persica) on the fruit of which doves fed. 1) xx. 135, 12. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 62; Weber, Transactions of 
the Berlin Academy, 1895, 861.

पीलुमती
पीलुमती
 is in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 2, 48) the name of the 
intermediate heaven lying between the udanuvatī, ‘watery,’ and 
the pra-dyauḥ, ‘farthest heaven.’ It presumably means ‘rich 
in Pīlu.’ Cf. Div.

पुंश्चली
पुंश्-चली
 (‘running after men’) is found in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	1 the Atharvaveda,
	2 and later,
	3 to denote a ‘wanton

पुं-सवन
 (‘male-production’ ceremony) is found in the

पुञ्जिष्ठ
पुञ्जि-ष्ठ
 is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās

पुण्डरीक
 denotes the blossom of the lotus in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.

पुत्र
पुत्र
 is, with Sūnu, the usual name for ‘son’ from the 
Rigveda onwards.
	1 The original sense of the word was 
apparently ‘small,’ or something analogous.
	2 The form 
Putraka
	3 is often used with the distinct intention of an affec
tionate address to a younger man, not merely a son proper. 
Reference is frequently made to the desire for a son.

पुत्रसेन
पुत्र-सेन
 is the name of a man in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā 
(iv. 6, 6).

पुत्रिका
पुत्रिका
 in the later literature
	1 has the technical sense of the 
daughter of a man without sons, whom he gives in marriage on 
the express terms that her son shall perform the funeral rites 
for him, and be counted as his. The thing as well as the name 
is recognized by Yāska in the Nirukta,
	2 and traced to the 
Rigveda.
	3 But the passages in the Rigveda are of very 
uncertain meaning,
	4 and in all probability do not refer to this 
custom at all. 1) Mānava Dharma Śāstra, ix. 127 et

पुनर्दत्त
पुनर्-दत्त
 (‘given again’) is the name of a teacher in the 
Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (viii. 8).

पुनर्भू
पुनर्-भू
 is found in the Atharvaveda
	1 meaning a wife who 
marries again, a rite being mentioned by which she can ensure 
reunion with her second (not her first) husband in the next 
world. 1) ix. 5, 28. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 537.

पुनर्वसु
पुनर्-वसु
 (‘bringing goods again’), used in the dual, 
denotes the fifth in the series of the Vedic Nakṣatras, or 
‘Lunar Mansions.’ Roth
	1 takes the word to have this sense 
in its only occurrence in the Rigveda,
	2 but this must be regarded 
as decidedly doubtful. The term is, however, found in the 
ordinary lists of the Nakṣatras in the later Saṃhitās and the 
Brāhmaṇas.

पुनःसर
पुनः-सर,
 ‘recurrent,’ is the epithet of the barking dog in 
the Rigveda,
	1 which is told to bark at the thief. It refers, not 
doubt, to the dog's practice of running to and fro when it 
barks. It is also applied to a plant, Apāmārga (Achyranthes 
aspera), in the Atharvaveda,
	2 with the sense of ‘having revertent 
leaves.’ 1) vii. 55, 3; Pischel, Vedische Studien, 
2, 56, n. 1. 2) iv. 17, 2; vi. 129, 3; x. 1, 9. Cf. 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 179. Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 394, prefers the sense of 
‘attacking,’ which is the meaning of 
prati-sara, Av. viii. 5, 5. Cf. Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 20.

पुमांस्
पुमांस्
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 man as the 
‘male.’ It has no special reference to marriage like Pati, or to 
heroism like Nṛ or Nara. In grammar it denotes the masculine 
gender.
	3 1) i. 124, 7; 162, 22; iii. 29, 13; iv. 3, 
10, etc. 2) Av. iii. 6, 1; 23, 3; iv. 4, 4;

10, and puṃṣā nakṣatreṇa, ‘a Nakṣatra 
with a masculine name,’ in the Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 3, 1.

पुर्
पुर्
 is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later,
	2 meaning ‘rampart,’ ‘fort,’ or ‘stronghold.’ Such fortifi
cations must have been occasionally of considerable size, as 
one is called ‘broad’ (pṛthvī) and ‘wide’ (urvī).
	3 Elsewhere
	4 
a fort ‘made of stone’ (aśmamayī) is mentioned. Sometimes 
strongholds ‘of iron’ (āyasī) are referred to,
	5 but these are 
probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ (gomatī) is 
mentioned,
	6 showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle. 
‘Autumnal’ (śāradī) forts are named, apparently as belonging 
to the Dāsas: this may refer to the forts in that season being 
occupied against Āryan attacks or against inundations caused 
by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ (śata- 
bhuji) are spoken of.
	7 
It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as 
permanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the 
mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge 
against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and 
a ditch (cf. Dehī). Pischel and Geldner,
	8 however, think that 
there were towns with wooden walls and ditches ( and ) like the Indian town of Pāṭaliputra known to Megas
thenes
	9 and the Pāli texts.
	10 This is possible, but hardly 
susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the 
word Nagara is of late occurrence. On the whole it is hardly 
likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed. 
In the Epic, according to Hopkins,
	11 there are found the 
Nagara, ‘city’; Grāma, ‘village’; and Ghoṣa, ‘ranch.’ Vedic 
literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with 
modifications in its later period. 
The siege of forts is mentioned in the Saṃhitās and Brāh
maṇas.
	12 According to the Rigveda,
	13 fire was used. 1) i. 53, 7, 58, 8; 131, 4; 166, 8;

Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 4, 3-5; Gopatha 
Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 7, etc. 13) vii. 5, 3. Possibly, in some cases, 
the palisade was no more than a hedge 
of thorn or a row of stakes (cf. Rv. 
x. 101, 8), as suggested by Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 143, 145; and cf. 
Rv. viii. 53, 5, as corrected by Roth, 
Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen 
Gesellschaft, 48, 109. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 142
148, who compares the fact that neither 
the Germans (Tacitus, Germania, 16) 
nor the Slavs (Procopius, De bello Gotico, 
iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the 
ancient Indians, were scattered in 
villages, each consisting of the houses 
and steadings of the several families 
living in the village. The evidence 
seems pretty convincing. It is true 
that the Greeks, when we first find 
them, evidently knew castles and for
tresses of the mediæval type; but the 
Greeks were clearly an invading race, 
superimposed on an older and in 
civilization more advanced people (see, 
e.g., Burrows, Discoveries in Crete). But 
the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have 
sometimes been built within the limits 
of the village. Whether, as he urges 
(144), the śāradī pur was a protection 
against the floods of autumn is un
certain. Cf. Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2; 
vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not 
legitimate to connect the mention of 
those forts with the fact that the Pūrus 
lived on either side of the Sindhu 
(Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's 
attack on the aborigines was directed 
against the forts in which they normally 
protected themselves on the rising of 
the river. No argument for the large 
size of cities can be drawn from the 
mention in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, v. 1, 
of ekādaśa-dvāra as an epithet of Pura 
(cf. Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad, iii. 18; 
nava-dvāra pura, ‘the citadel of nine 
doors’), because it is used meta
phorically of the body, and the number 
of doors depends on the nature of the 
body (Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 185). 
The evidence of the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to 
point to only one gate in a city.

412; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 451;

Mahāpur.

पुरंधि
पुरं-धि
 occurs in the Rigveda,
	1 possibly as the name of a 
woman, a protégée of the Aśvins, who gave her a son, Hiraṇya- 
hasta. 1) i. 116, 13. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 398.

पुरय
 is the name of a patron celebrated in a Dānastuti 
(‘Praise of Gifts’) in the Rigveda.
	1 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwing, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158.

पुराण
1. Purāṇa, denoting a tale ‘of olden times,’ is often found
	1 
in the combination Itihāsa-Purāṇa, which is probably a 
Dvandva compound meaning ‘Itihāsa and Purāṇa.’ It some
times
	2 occurs as a separate word, but beside Itihāsa, no doubt 
with the same sense as in the Dvandva. Sāyaṇa
	3 defines a 
Purāṇa as a tale which deals with the primitive condition of 
the universe and the creation of the world, but there is no 
ground for supposing that this view is correct, or for clearly 
distinguishing Itihāsa and Purāṇa. See Itihāsa. 1) Satāpatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 6, 8;

पुरीकय
पुरीकय
 is the name of a water animal in the Atharvaveda,

being clearly a variant of the name that appears as Pulīkaya in 
the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,
	2 and as Kulīpaya in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	3 and as Kulīkaya in the Taittirī, Brāhmaṇa.

animal is meant is quite unknown. 1) xi. 2, 25. 2) iii. 14, 2. Pulīkā, ibid., 5, is a

पुरीषिणी
 is found in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 apparently 
either as the name of a river,
	2 or much more probably as an 
epithet of the Sarayu,

पुरुकुत्स
पुरु-कुत्स
 is the name of a king who is mentioned several 
times in the Rigveda. In one passage
	1 he is mentioned as a 
contemporary of Sudās, but whether as a foe, according to 
Ludwig,
	2 or merely as a contemporary, according to Hille
brandt,
	3 is uncertain. In two other passages
	4 he is mentioned 
as victorious by divine favour, and in another
	5 he appears as a 
king of the Pūrus and a conqueror of the Dāsas. His son was 
Trasadasyu,
	6 who is accordingly called Paurukutsya
	7 or 
Paurukutsi.
	8 Different conclusions have been drawn from one 
hymn of the Rigveda
	9 in which the birth of Purukutsa's son, 
Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that 
Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his 
wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But 
Sieg
	10 offers a completely different interpretation. According 
to him the word daurgahe, which occurs in the hymn, and 
which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’ 
an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn 
recording the success of an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 
undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later 
times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the 
version of daurgahe given in the Śatapatha,
	11 but is by no 
means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of 
Sudās, the defeat of the Pūrus by Sudās in the Dāśarājña
	12 
might well have been the cause of the troubles from which 
Purukutsānī, by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family. 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	13 Purukutsa is called an Aikṣvāka. 1) i. 63, 7. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 174, 
emending sudāse in the text to sudāsam, 
plausibly, but not, of course, con
vincingly. 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 115. Cf.

Pūru also is mentioned. Ludwig sug
gests reading in vi. 20, 10, saudāsīḥ for 
dāsīḥ, referring to the forts of Sudās; 
but this must be regarded as illegiti
mate. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift, 55,

पुरुकुत्सानी
पुरुकुत्सानी,
 ‘wife of Purukutsa,’ is mentioned as the 
mother of Trasadasyu in one hymn of the Rigveda (iv. 42, 9).

पुरुणीथशातवनेय
पुरु-णीथ शात-वनेय
 (‘descendant of Śatavani’) is the 
name of a sacrificer, or perhaps a priest, a Bhāradvāja, in the 
Rigveda.
	1 It is doubtful whether he is also mentioned as a 
singer in another passage of the Rigveda.
	2 In both places 
Roth
	3 sees in Puru-ṇītha merely a word meaning ‘choral song.’ 1) i. 59, 7. 2) vii. 9. 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 160; Oldenberg, 
Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 60. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

पुरुदम
पुरु-दम
 occurs in the plural in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where, 
according to Ludwig,
	2 it is probably the proper name of the 
singers, but by Roth
	3 and Whitney
	4 is understood as merely 
an adjective meaning ‘possessed of many houses’ 1) vii. 73, 1. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
xxv. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda,

पुरुपन्था
पुरु-पन्था
 is mentioned as a generous donor to a Bharad- 
vāja in one hymn of the Rigveda (vi. 63, 10).

पुरुमाय्य
पुरु-माय्य
 occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as a 
protégé of Indra. It is quite possible that he was the father of, 
or at least connected with, Atithigva, Ṛkṣa, and Aśvamedha, 
who are celebrated in the hymn. 1) viii. 68, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

पुरुमित्र
पुरु-मित्र
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda (i. 117, 20; 
x. 39, 7) as the father of a maiden who wedded Vimada, 
apparently against her father's will.

पुरुमीळ्ह
पुरु-मीळ्ह
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda
	1 as an ancient 
sage, in which capacity he appears in the Atharvaveda
	2 also. 
Perhaps the same
	3 Purumīḷha is intended in an obscure hymn 
in the Rigveda,
	4 where, according to the legends reported in 
the Bṛhaddevatā
	5 and by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in his commentary on 
the Sarvānukramaṇī,
	6 and by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the 
Rigveda,
	4 he as well as Taranta was a son of Vidadaśva, and 
a patron of the singer Śyāvāśva. The correctness of the legend 
has been shown to be most improbable by Oldenberg,
	7 who 
points out
	8 that the legend misinterprets the Rigveda by 
making Purumīḷha a Vaidadaśvi, for he is there only compared 
in generosity to one. 
In another legend found in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	9 and 
based on a hymn of the Rigveda,
	10 Purumīḷha and Taranta 
appear as persons who received gifts from Dhvasra and Puru- 
ṣanti, and as sons of Vidadaśva. The legend, which also 
occurs in the Śāṭyāyanaka,
	11 is apparently best explained by 
Sieg,
	12 who says that as the two were kings they could not 
under the rules of caste accept gifts, unless for the nonce they 
became singers. The legend has no claim at all, as Oldenberg
	13 
shows, to validity. 1) i. 151, 2; 183. 5. 2) iv. 29, 4; xviii. 3, 15. 3) See, however, Weber, Episches im

the legend is not accepted by the 
Anukramaṇī (Index), since its list of 
authors gives Avatsāra as the Ṛṣi, not 
the two Taranta and Purumīḷha.

पुरुष
पुरुष,
 or Pūruṣa, is the generic term for ‘man’ in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 Man is composed of five parts accord
ing to the Atharvaveda,
	3 or of six according to the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	4 or of sixteen,
	5 or of twenty,
	6 or of twenty-one,
	7 
or of twenty-four,
	8 or of twenty-five,
	9 all more or less fanciful 
enumerations. Man is the first of animals,
	10 but also essentially 
an animal (see Paśu). The height of a man is given in the 
Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	11 as four Aratnis (‘cubits’) , each of two 
Padas (‘feet’), each of twelve Aṅgulis (‘finger's breadths’); and 
the term Puruṣa itself is found earlier
	12 as a measure of length. 
Puruṣa is also applied to denote the length of a man's life, 
a ‘generation’;
	13 the ‘pupil’ in the eye;
	14 and in the gram
matical literature the ‘person’ of the verb.

पुरुषमृग
पुरुष मृग
 the ‘man wild beast,’ occurs in the list of 
victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 
Zimmer's
	2 view that the ape is meant seems probable. 
According to him also, the word Puruṣa alone, in two passages 
of the Atharvaveda,
	3 refers to the ape and its cry (māyu); but 
this sense is not necessary, and it is not adopted by Bloomfield,
	4 
though Whitney
	5 does not think the rendering ‘cry of a man’ 
satisfactory, the term māyu not being properly applicable to 
the noise made by human beings. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 15, 1;

पुरुषहस्तिन्
पुरुष हस्तिन्
 (‘the man with a hand’) is found in the list

पुरुषन्ति
पुरुषन्ति
 is a name that occurs twice in the Rigveda,
	1 in 
the first passage denoting a protégé of the Aśvins, in the second 
a patron who gave presents to one of the Vedic singers. In 
both cases the name is joined with that of Dhvasanti or 
Dhvasra. The presumption from the manner in which these 
three names are mentioned is that they designate men, but the 
grammatical form of the words might equally well be feminine. 
Females must be meant, if the evidence of the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 is to be taken as decisive, for the form of the first 
of the two names there occurring, Dhvasre Puruṣantī, ‘Dhvasrā 
and Puruṣanti,’ is exclusively feminine, though here as well as 
elsewhere Sāyaṇa
	3 interprets the names as masculines. See 
also Taranta and Purumīḷha. 1) i. 112, 23; ix. 58, 3. 2) xiii. 7, 12. Roth thinks the feminine 
form Dhvasre here is a corruption, based 
on the dual form occurring in the 
Rigveda, Dhvasrayoḥ, which might be 
feminine as well as masculine. 3) Also on the Śāṭyāyanaka, cited 
on Rv. ix. 58, 3, and on Rv. i. 112, 
23.

पुरुहन्मन्
पुरु-हन्मन्
 is the name of a Ṛṣi in a hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 
an Āṅgirasa, according to the Rigvedic Anukramaṇī (Index),

	2 a Vaikhānasa. 1) viii. 70, 2) xiv. 9, 29. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 107.

पुरूरवस्
पुरू-रवस्
 is the name of a hero in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 
containing a curious dialogue between him and a nymph, 
Urvaśī, an Apsaras. He is also mentioned in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 where several verses of the Rigvedic dialogue find 
a setting in a continuous story. In the later literature he is 
recognized as a king.
	3 His name is perhaps intended in one 
other passage of the Rigveda.
	4 It is impossible to say whether 
he is a mythical figure pure and simple, or really an ancient 
king. His epithet, Aiḷa,
	5 ‘descendant of Iḍā’ (a sacrificial 
goddess), is certainly in favour of the former alternative. 1) x. 95. 2) xi. 5, 1, 1. Cf. iii. 4, 1, 22; Kāṭhaka

पुरूरु
पुरूरु
 is the name of a poet, an Ātreya, in the Rigveda,
	1 
according to Ludwig.
	2 But the only form of the word found, 
purūruṇā, seems merely an adverb meaning ‘far and wide.’ 1) v. 70, 1. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126.

Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 215,

पुरूवसु
पुरू-वसु
 (‘abounding in wealth’) is the name of a poet, an 
Ātreya, according to Ludwig,
	1 in one passage of the Rigveda.
	2 
But this is very doubtful. 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 126. 2) v. 36, 3. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift

पुरोनुवाक्या
पुरो-ऽनुवाक्या
 (‘introductory verse to be recited’) is the 
technical term for the address to a god inviting him to partake 
of the offering; it was followed by the Yājyā, which accom
panied the actual oblation.
	1 Such addresses are not unknown, 
but are rare, according to Oldenberg,
	2 in the Rigveda; subse
quently they are regular, the word itself occurring in the later

पुरोवात
पुरो-वात,
 the ‘east wind,’ is mentioned in the later Saṃ

पुरोहित
पुरो-हित
 (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a 
priest in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 The office of Purohita is 
called Purohiti
	3 and Purodhā. It is clear that the primary 
function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a 
king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position 
is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be 
mentioned in Vedic literature.
	4 Examples of Purohitas in the 
Rigveda are Viśvāmitra
	5 or Vasiṣṭha
	6 in the service of the 
Bharata king; Sudās, of the Tṛtsu family; the Purohita of 
Kuruśravaṇa;
	7 and Devāpi, the Purohita of Śantanu.
	8 The 
Purohita was in all religious matters the alter ego of the king. 
In the ritual
	9 it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita, 
else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the 
king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers;
	10 he procures 
the fall of rain for the crops;
	11 he is the flaming fire that 
guards the kingdom.
	12 Divodāsa in trouble is rescued by 
Bharadvāja;
	13 and King Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka 
reproaches his Purohita, Vṛśa Jāna, when his car runs over 
a Brahmin boy and kills him.
	14 The close relation of king and 
Purohita is illustrated by the case of Kutsa Aurava, who slew 
his Purohita, Upagu Sauśravasa, for disloyalty in serving 
Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile.
	15 Other disputes between 
kings and priests who officiated for them are those of Janam- 
ejaya and the Kaśyapas, and of Viśvantara and the Śyā- 
parṇas;
	16 and between Asamāti and the Gaupāyanas.
	17 In 
some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for 
example, Devabhāga Śrautarṣa was the Purohita of the 
Kurus and the Sṛṅjayas at the same time,
	18 and Jala Jātū- 
karṇya was the Purohita of the kings of Kāśi, Videha, and 
Kosala.
	19 
There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was 
hereditary in a family, though it probably was so.
	20 At any 
rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with 
King Kuruśravaṇa, and with his son Upamaśravas,
	21 that a 
king would keep on the Purohita of his father. 
Zimmer
	22 thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita, 
as shown by the case of King Viśvantara, who sacrificed with
out the help of the Śyāparṇas,
	23 and that a Purohita need not 
be a priest, as shown by the case of Devāpi and Śantanu.
	24 
But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that 
Viśvantara sacrificed without priests, while Devāpi is not 
regarded as a king until the Nirukta,
	25 and there is no 
reason to suppose that Yāska's view expressed in that work 
is correct. 
According to Geldner,
	26 the Purohita from the beginning 
acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being 
there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of 
this view, he cites the fact that Vasiṣṭha is mentioned both as 
Purohita
	27 and as Brahman:
	28 at the sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa he 
served as Brahman,
	29 but he was the Purohita of Sudās;
	30 
Bṛhaspati is called the Purohita
	31 and the Brahman
	32 of the 
gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brah
mans at the sacrifice.
	33 It is thus clear that the Brahman was 
often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the 
case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the 
later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice.
	34 But 
the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the 
earlier ritual; Oldenberg
	35 seems to be right in holding that 
the Purohita was originally the Hotṛ priest, the singer par 
excellence, when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great 
sacrifices with the Ṛtvijs. So Devāpi seems clearly to have 
been a Hotṛ;
	36 Agni is at once Purohita
	37 and Hotṛ;
	38 and the 
‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also 
called the ‘two Purohitas.’
	39 Later, no doubt, when the 
priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with 
his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required 
magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice.
	40 
There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priest
hood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical 
times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may 
safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public 
affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's 
conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the 
Purohita represents, as Roth
	41 and Zimmer
	42 thought, the 
source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already 
in existence in the Rigveda (see Varṇa). 1) i. 1, 1; 44, 10. 12; ii. 24, 9; iii. 2, 8; 
3, 2; v. 11, 2; vi. 70, 4, etc. 2) Av. viii. 5, 5; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
ix. 23; xi. 81; xxxi. 20; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24, etc.; Nirukta, 
ii. 12; vii. 15. 3) Rv. vii. 60, 12; 83, 4. 4) Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 144, 
thinks that several Purohitas were 
possible, quoting Sāyaṇa, on Rv. x. 57, 1, 
who gives the tale of the Gaupāyanas 
and King Asamāti from the Śāṭyāya
naka, and comparing the case of 
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra as Purohitas, 
probably contemporaneously, of Sudās. 
But that the two were contemporaneous 
is most unlikely, especially if we adopt 
the very probable view of Hopkins 
(Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
15, 260 et seq.) that Viśvāmitra was 
with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when 
they unsuccessfully attacked Sudās. 
The other narrative has, as Oldenberg, 
Religion des Veda, 375, n. 3, observes, 
a markedly fictitious character; while 
every other passage that mentions a 
Purohita speaks of him in the singular, 
and as there was only one Brahman 
priest at the sacrifice, so the Purohita 
acted as Brahman. 5) iii. 33. 53. Cf. vii. 18. 6) Rv. vii. 18. 83. 7) Rv. x. 33. See Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 150, 184. 8) Rv. x. 98. 9) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24. 10) See Av. iii. 19; Rv. vii. 18, 13, 
from which Geldner, op. cit., 2, 135, 
n. 3, concludes that the priest prayed 
in the Sabhā, ‘house of assembly,’ while 
the king fought on the field of battle.

could be one when he wished. 27) Rv. x. 150, 5. 28) Rv. vii. 33, 11. But this need

lx, lxi) requires a follower of that Veda 
to act as Brahman, and the spells of 
the Atharvan are, in fact, closely allied 
to the spells of the Purohita as repre
sented in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
viii. 24-28. Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit

पुलस्ति
पुलस्ति
 
	1 or Pulastin
	2 in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās denotes 
‘wearing the hair plain,’ as opposed to kapardin, ‘wearing the 
hair in braids.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 9, 1; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 43. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhītā, xvii. 15. Cf.

पुलिन्द
पुलिन्द
 is the name of an outcast tribe mentioned with the 
Andhras in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 but not in the Śāṅkhā
yana Śrauta Sūtra,
	2 in connexion with the story of Śunaḥśepa. 
The Pulindas again appear associated with the Andhras in the 
time of Aśoka.

पुलीकय
पुलीकय
 See Purīkaya.

पुलीका
पुलीका
 seems to designate some kind of bird in the Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 14, 5). The name appears in the form of 
Kulīkā in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxiv. 24).

पुलुषप्राचीनयोग्य
पुलुष प्राचीन-योग्य
 (‘descendant of Prācīnayoga’) is the 
name of a teacher, a pupil of Dṛti Aindroti Śaunaka, in a 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 
(iii. 40, 2). He taught Pauluṣi Satyayajña.

पुष्कर
पुष्कर
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 of the blue 
lotus flower. The Atharvaveda
	3 mentions its sweet perfume. 
The lotus grew in lakes, which were thence called puṣkariṇī, 
‘lotus-bearing.’
	4 That the flower was early used for personal 
adornment is shown by an epithet of the Aśvins, ‘lotus
crowned’ (puṣkara-sraj).
	5 
Presumably because of its likeness in shape to the flower 
of the lotus, the bowl of the ladle is called Puṣkara, perhaps 
already in the Rigveda,
	6 and certainly in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa.
	7 Moreover, according to the Nirukta,
	8 Puṣkara means 
‘water,’ a sense actually found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	9 1) vi. 16, 13; vii. 33, 11, may be so 
taken, though Roth, St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v. 3, and Geldner, Rigveda, 
Glossar, 112, prefer to see in these 
passages a reference to the bowl of the 
sacrificial ladle. 2) Av. xi. 3, 8; xii. 1, 24; Taittirīya

पुष्करसाद
पुष्कर-साद,
 ‘sitting on the lotus,’ is the name of an 
animal in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 
in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 It can hardly be a ‘snake,’
	2 but 
rather either, as Roth
	3 thinks, a ‘bird,’ or perhaps, according 
to the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	1 a ‘bee.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1;

पूतक्रता
पूत-क्रता
 is the name of a woman in a Vālakhilya hymn 
of the Rigveda,
	1 perhaps the wife of Pūtakratu, but this is 
doubtful, since the more regular form would be Pūtakratāyī,
	2 
which Scheftelowitz
	3 reads in the hymn. 1) viii. 64, 4. 2) Pāṇini, iv. 1, 36. 3) Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 41,

पूतक्रतु
पूत-क्रतु
 (‘of clear insight’) is the name of a patron in 
the Rigveda,
	1 apparently the son of Aśvamedha. 1) viii. 68, 17. Cf. Ludwig, Transla
tion of the Rigveda, 3, 163. Scheftelo
witz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 41, 
reads Pūtakratu for Pautakrata in Rv. 
viii. 56, 2, but this is improbable. See

पूतिरज्जु
पूति-रज्जु
 is the name of a certain plant of unknown kind 
in the Atharvaveda
	1 according to Roth.
	2 The Kauśika Sūtra
	3 
treats it as a ‘putrid rope,’ but Ludwig
	4 suggests that a snake 
is meant. 1) viii. 8, 2. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) xvi. 10. 4) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 527.

पूतीक
पूतीक
 is the name of a plant often mentioned
	1 as a sub
stitute for the Soma plant. It is also given in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	2 as a means of making milk curdle, being an alternative 
to the bark of the Butea frondosa (parṇa-valka). It is usually 
identified with the Guilandina Bonduc, but Hillebrandt
	3 makes 
it out to be the Basella Cordifolia. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 3 (pūtika, 
 as quoted in the St. Petersburg Dic

 is another name for the Deodar (deva-dāru) in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.

पूरु
पूरु
 is the name of a people and their king in the Rigveda. 
They are mentioned with the Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas, 
and Yadus in one passage.
	1 They also occur as enemies of 
the Tṛtsus in the hymn of Sudās’ victory.
	2 In another 
hymn
	3 Agni of the Bharatas is celebrated as victorious over the 
Pūrus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow. 
On the other hand, victories of the Pūrus over the aborigines 
seem to be referred to in several passages.
	4 
The great kings of the Pūrus were Purukutsa and his son 
Trasadasyu, whose name bears testimony to his prowess 
against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was Tṛkṣi Trāsa- 
dasyava. 
In the Rigveda the Pūrus are expressly
	5 mentioned as on 
the Sarasvatī. Zimmer
	6 thinks that the Sindhu (Indus) is 
meant in this passage. But Ludwig
	7 and Hillebrandt
	8 with 
much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvatī in 
Kurukṣetra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden 
disappearance of the name of the Pūrus from Vedic tradition, 
a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's
	9 conjecture that 
the Pūrus became part of the great Kuru people, just as 
Turvaśa and Krivi disappear from the tradition on their being 
merged in the Pañcāla nation. Trāsadasyava, the patronymic 
of Kuruśravaṇa in the Rigveda,
	10 shows that the royal 
families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by inter
marriage. 
Hillebrandt,
	11 admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived 
in the eastern country round the Sarasvatī, thinks that in 
earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus 
with Divodāsa. This theory must fall with the theory that 
Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to 
be supported by the fact that Alexander found a  — that 
is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes,
	12 a sort of half-way 
locality between the Sarasvatī and the West. But it is quite 
simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier 
home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had 
wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a success
ful onslaught upon the west from the east. 
In several other passages of the Rigveda
	13 the Pūrus as a 
people seem to be meant. The Nirukta
	14 recognizes the general 
sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or 
even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	15 explains Pūru in the Rigveda
	16 as 
an Asura Rakṣas; it is only in the Epic that Pūru revives as 
the name of a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā.
	17 1) i. 108. 8. 2) vii. 18, 13. Cf. Turvaśa. Ap
parently, as Hopkins, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 15, 263, n., 
and Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 135, 
think, in this verse the words jeṣma 
Pūruṃ vidathe mṛdhravācam refer to the 
Pūru king and to the priest Viśvāmitra, 
who prayed for the defeat of Sudās, 
though in vain. Hopkins seems to take 
the words vidathe mṛdhravācam generally 
as ‘the false speaker in the assembly’; 
but, according to Geldner, the meaning 
intended is that, while the king fought, 
the Purohita prayed in the Sabhā, or 
meeting house of the people. 3) Rv. vii. 8, 4. 4) i. 59, 6; 131, 4; 174, 2; iv. 21, 10; 
38, 1; vi. 20, 10; vii. 5, 3; 19, 3. 
Cf. note 13. 5) vii. 96, 2. Perhaps they are also 
meant as living on the Śaryaṇāvant in 
Rv. viii. 64, 10. 11. 6) Altindisches Leben, 124. 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 175. 8) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 50, 115;

3, etc. See Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 1, 132, 133. 13) In Rv. i. 36, 1, Pūrūṇām might be 
read for purūṇām, with improvement 
in the sense. In i. 63, 7, there is a 
reference to the Pūru king, Purukutsa, 
and Sudās, but in what relation is 
uncertain (see Purukutsa). In i. 130, 7. 
the Pūru king and Divodāsa Atithigva 
are both mentioned, apparently as 
victorious over aboriginal foes. See 
also i. 129, 5; iv. 39, 2; v. 17, 1; 
vi. 46, 8; x. 4, 1; 48, 5. 14) vii. 23; Naighaṇṭuka, ii. 3. 15) vi. 8, 1, 14. 16) vii. 8, 4. 17) Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic

पूरुष
पूरुष
 has in several passages
	1 the sense of ‘menial’ or 
‘dependent,’ like the English ‘man.’ 1) Rv. vi. 39, 5 (cf., however, Pischel, 
Vedische Studien, 1, 43); x. 97, 4; Av.

पूर्णमास
पूर्ण-मास
 denotes the full moon and the festival of that 
day, occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās.
	1 Cf. Māsa. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 7, 2; ii. 2, 
10, 2; 5, 4, 1; iii. 4, 4, 1; vii. 4, 8, 1;

पूर्त
पूर्त,
 
	1 or Pūrti,
	2 occurs in the Rigveda and later denoting 
the reward to the priest for his services. Cf. Dakṣiṇā. 1) Rv. vi. 16, 18; viii. 46, 21; Av. 
vi. 123, 5; ix. 5, 13; 6, 31; Vājasaneyi

पूर्पति
पूर्-पति,
 ‘lord of the fort,’ occurring only once in the 
Rigveda,
	1 is of somewhat doubtful interpretation. The term 
may denote a regular office,
	2 similar to that of the Grāmaṇī: 
the Pur would then be a permanently occupied settlement. 
The expression may, however, merely mean the chief over a 
fort when it was actually occupied against hostile attack. The 
rarity of the word seems to favour the latter sense. 1) i. 173. 10. 2) Cf. Sāyaṇa's note, on Rv. i. 173, 
10; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 456.

veda, 3, 204.

पूर्वपक्ष
पूर्व-पक्ष
 denotes the first half of the month. See Māsa.

पूर्ववयस
पूर्व-वयस,
 the ‘first period of life,’ is a term used in the 
Brāhmaṇas
	1 to denote ‘youth.’ 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xix. 4, 3; 
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 2, 3, 4; 
9, 1, 8; pūrva-vayasin, Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa, iii. 8, 13, 3. Cf. Aitareya Āraṇ
yaka, v. 3, 3, where vatsa and tṛtīya, 
‘the third (stage),’ are used to cover 
‘youth’ and ‘old age,’ as opposed to 
manhood, when the knowledge of the 
doctrines of the Āraṇyaka is to be 
imparted.

पूर्ववह्
पूर्व-वह्
 is a term applied to the horse (Aśva) in the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 and elsewhere.
	2 It may either refer to a 
horse fastened in front as a ‘leader,’ or merely mean ‘drawing 
(a chariot) for the first time,’ as understood by the commentator 
on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) i. 1, 5, 6 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 4, 17; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 3.

common designation of time from the Rigveda
	1 onwards.

पूल्य
पूल्य,
 or Pūlpa, in the Atharvaveda
	1 seems to mean 
‘shrivelled grain’ (cf. Lājā). 1) xiv. 2, 63. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 765.

पृक्ष
पृक्ष
 (literally, perhaps ‘swift’) is the proper name of a 
man in an obscure verse of the Rigveda.
	1 1) ii. 13, 8. Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 97.

पृक्षयाम
पृक्ष-याम
 occurs once in the plural in the Rigveda.
	1 
Roth
	2 suggests the sense of ‘faring with swift steeds,’ and 
thinks a proper name is meant. Pischel
	3 holds that the word 
is an epithet of the Pajras, and that it means ‘performing 
splendid sacrifices.’ 1) i. 122, 7. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 97, 98.

पृड

	1 and Pṛtanā
	2 denote, in the Rigveda and later, ‘contest,’ 
whether in arms or in the chariot race. Pṛtanā has also the 
concrete sense of ‘army’ in some passages;
	3 in the Epic 
system
	4 it denotes a definite body of men, elephants, chariots, 
and horses. Pṛtanājya
	5 has only the sense of ‘combat.’ 1) Only in the locative, Rv. ii. 27, 15;

पृथि
पृथि,
 
	1 Pṛthī,
	2 or Pṛthu
	3 is the name of a semi-mythical 
personage who is mentioned in the Rigveda and later as a Ṛṣi, 
and more specially as the inventor of agriculture
	4 and the lord 
of both worlds, of men and of animals.
	5 He bears in several 
passages
	6 the epithet Vainya, ‘descendant of Vena,’ and must 
probably be regarded as a culture hero rather than as a real 
man. According to other accounts,
	7 he was the first of con
secrated kings. Cf. Pārthiva. 1) Rv. i. 112, 15, as a seer; as Vainya,

पृथिवी
पृथिवी
 denotes the ‘earth’ as the ‘broad’ one in the Rigveda
	1 
and later,
	2 being often personified as a deity
	3 both alone and 
with Div, ‘heaven,’ as Dyāvā-Pṛthivī.
	4 Mention is often made 
of three earths,
	5 of which the world on which we live is the 
highest.
	6 The earth is girdled by the ocean, according to the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	7 The Nirukta
	8 places one of the three 
earths in each of the worlds into which the universe is divided 
(see Div). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	9 the earth is called 
the ‘firstborn of being,’ and its riches (vitta) are referred to;
	10 
hence in a late passage of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	11 the 
earth is styled vasu-matī, ‘full of wealth.’ The word also occurs 
in the Rigveda,
	12 though rarely, in the form of Pṛthvī.

पृथु

पृथुश्रवस्
1. Pṛthu-śravas (‘far-famed’) is mentioned in connexion 
with Vaśa in two hymns
	1 of the Rigveda. In the second 
passage the generosity of Pṛthuśravas Kānīta to Vaśa Aśvya is 
celebrated, and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 refers to the 
episode. 1) i. 116, 21; viii. 46, 21. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 162. 2) xvi. 11, 13.

पृथुश्रवस्दौरेश्रवस
2. Pṛthu-śravas Daure-śravasa (‘descendant of Dūreśravas’)

पृदाकु,
 the name of a ‘snake’ in the Atharvaveda,
	1 is 
mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse 
sacrifice’), in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	2 and occasionally else 
where.

पृदाकुसानु
पृदाकु-सानु,
 ‘having the surface of a snake,’ is taken by 
Ludwig
	1 and Griffith
	2 as the name of the institutor of a 
sacrifice in one hymn of the Rigveda.

 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 is considered by 
Ludwig
	2 to denote a place where a battle was fought. 1) ix. 97, 54. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 16.

पृश्निगु
1. Pṛśni-gu is the name of a man who is mentioned with 
Purukutsa and Śucanti as a protégé of the Aśvins in one 
hymn of the Rigveda (i. 112, 7). Possibly the word is only an 
epithet of Purukutsa. 
Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 114.

पृश्निगु
2. Pṛśni-gu, pl., is taken in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 by 
Geldner
	2 as denoting the name of a people. But this is not 
probable. 1) vii. 18, 10. 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 114.

पृश्निपर्णी
पृश्नि-पर्णी
 (‘having a speckled leaf’) is the name of a plant 
mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda
	1 as a protection 
against evil beings procuring abortion, called Kaṇvas (pre
sumably a sign of hostility to the Kaṇva family).
	2 It also 
appears in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 being identified with 
Hermionitis cordifolia by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, but 
Roth
	4 in a subsequent contribution suggests that it is the 
same as a plant later called lakṣmaṇā, and regarded as curing 
barrenness. The scholiast on the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	5 
thinks that the Glycine debilis is meant. 1) ii. 25, 1 et seq. 2) Cf. Lanman in Whitney's Transla

पृषत
पृषत
 is the name of an animal mentioned in the list of 
victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās.
	1 The dappled antelope or gazelle seems to be 
meant.

पृषती
पृषती
 in some passages
	1 clearly means a ‘speckled’ cow. 
The term is, however, generally
	2 applied to the team of the 
Maruts, when its sense is doubtful. The commentators usually 
explain it as ‘speckled antelope.’ But Mahīdhara,
	3 followed by 
Roth,
	4 prefers to see in it a ‘dappled mare’: it is true that the 
Maruts are often called
	5 pṛṣad-aśva, which is more naturally 
interpreted as ‘having dappled steeds,’ than as ‘having Pṛṣatīs 
as steeds.’
	6 In the later literature, which Grassmann
	7 prefers 
to follow, the word means the female of the dappled gazelle. 
Aufrecht
	8 concurs in the view of Roth, but Max Müller
	9 is 
inclined to accept the traditional interpretation, while Muir
	10 
leaves the matter open. 1) Rv. viii. 64, 10. 11, where ‘deer’ 
is nonsense, and ‘mares’ is improb
able. The regular donation is ‘cows’; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 2; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 2, 9 (see Eggeling, 
Sacred Books of the East, 41, 125);

this is not certain); Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta

had earlier (ibid., 1, 1091) been inclined 
to follow the usual interpretation given 
by Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 37, 2, etc., which 
Benfey, Orient und Occident, 2, 250, 
accepted. 5) Rv. i. 87, 4; 89, 7; 186, 8; ii. 34, 4; 
iii. 26, 6; v. 42, 15; vii. 40, 3 6) So Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 87, 4. This 
view is far-fetched, but is supported, 
in so far as the interpretation of Pṛṣatī 
and Aśva is concerned, by such passages 
as v. 55, 6, where the Maruts are said 
to yoke the Pṛṣatīs as aśvān to their 
chariots; but the sense may be ‘horses 
(and) dappled (mares).’ See, however,

पृषध्र
पृषध्र
 occurs in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as 
the name of a man. He is also mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra
	2 as a patron of Praskaṇva, and called Pṛṣadhra 
Medhya Mātariśvan (or Mātariśva); but for once there is a 
discrepancy between the statement of the Sūtra and the text 
of the Rigveda, for the hymns
	3 there attributed to Praskaṇva 
as in praise of Pṛṣadhra have nothing in them connected with 
Pṛṣadhra, while the Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes to Pṛṣadhra 
himself the authorship of one of them.
	4 On the other hand, 
Medhya and Mātariśvan appear as separate persons in the 
Rigveda
	1 along with Pṛṣadhra. 1) viii. 52, 2. 2) xvi. 11, 25-27. 3) viii. 55. 56. 4) viii. 56. 
Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual,

पृषातक
पृषातक
 is the name of a mixture like Pṛṣadājya, and 
consisting, according to the late Gṛhyasaṃgraha,
	1 of curds 
(Dadhi), honey (Madhu), and Ajya. It is mentioned in a late 
passage of the Atharvaveda
	2 and in the Sūtras.
	3 1) ii. 59. 2) xx. 134, 2. 3) Mānava Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 3, etc. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 35, 580.

पृष्ट्या
पृष्ट्या
 
	1 denotes in the Atharvaveda (vi. 102, 2) the side 
horse (mare). 1) So Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. 
Pṛṣṭhyā is read in the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary. See, however, Grill, Hun- 
dert Lieder,^2 169; Bloomfield; Hymns of 
the Atharvaveda, 513.

पृष्ट्यामय
पृष्ट्य्-आमय
 denotes in the Atharvaveda
	1 a pain in the sides 
or ribs.
	2 It appears to be mentioned there merely as an 
accompaniment of fever (Takman). 1) xix. 34, 10. Cf. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 65, 391. 2) The derivative adjective Pṛṇṭy- 
āmayin, ‘suffering from a pain in the 
side,’ occurs in Rv. i. 105, 18.

पेत्व
पेत्व
 is found twice in the Atharvaveda.
	1 In the first 
passage reference is made to its vāja, which Zimmer
	2 argues 
can only mean ‘strength,’ ‘swiftness,’ though naturally the 
sense of ‘male power’ would seem more appropriate in a spell 
intended to remove lack of virility. In the second passage the 
Petva is mentioned as overcoming the horse (see Ubhayādant), 
a miracle which has a parallel in the Rigveda,
	3 where the 
Petva overcomes the female
	4 lion. The animal also occurs in 
the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	5 and occasionally elsewhere.
	6 It appears 
to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter
	7 being the sense 
given to it by the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 
But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning, 
while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which 
vāja is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins,
	8 
however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is 
not clear. Whether it is connected in any way with Pitva or 
Pidva is quite uncertain. 1) iv. 4, 8; v. 19, 2. 2) Altindisches Leben, 229, 230. 3) vii. 18, 17. 4) Siṃhyam in the text. Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
15, 264, takes it as masculine, and as 
a play on śiṃyum, the name of one of 
the kings or peoples defeated in the 
battle of the ten kings. But, admitting 
the play, siṃhī as fem. seems to be still 
more pointed than siṃha, contrasting 
with the masculine petva. 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 22; 1. 
Though not in the parallel passage of 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, it appears to 
be found in the Kāṭhaka, according 
to Weber's note in his edition of the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā. 6) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 8, 4; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxix. 58. 59; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 5, 3. etc. 7) Galita-retasko meṣaḥ. 8) Loc. cit.; India, Old and New, 58. 
He thinks the born of the goat pierced 
the lion. Curiously enough, Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 253. 
renders the word a ‘goat’ in Av. 
v. 19, 2, but (p. 151) as ‘ram’ in iv. 4, 8; 
and Bloomfield Hymns of the Atharva- 
veda, 434, speaks Both of a ‘ram’ and a 
‘goat’ in connexion with v. 19, 2.

पेदु
पेदु
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 of a protégé of the Aśvins, 
who gave him, in order, as it seems, to replace a bad steed, a 
mythical horse, hence called Paidva,
	2 which probably repre
sents the horse of the sun.

name of a patron of the poet. 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158.

पेसस्
पेसस्
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 an embroidered 
garment such as a female dancer would wear.
	3 The fondness 
of the Indians for such raiment is noted by Megasthenes
	4 and 
by Arrian,
	5 who refer to their . So in one 
passage
	6 a garment (vastra) is called peśana, with which Roth
	7 
happily compares the Roman vestis coloribus intexta. The 
making of such garments was a regular occupation of women, 
as is indicated by the Peśas-kārī, the ‘female embroiderer,’ 
figuring in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human 
sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,
	8 though the, commentator on the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa interprets the word as ‘wife of a maker 
of gold.’
	9 Pischel,
	10 however, thinks that Peśas never means 
anything but colour or form. 1) ii. 3, 6; iv. 36, 7; vii. 34, 11; 42, 1. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 82. 89;

peśalam in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 3, 4, 5, where peśala probably refers 
to cunningly-worked gold. But this 
does not suit the compound peśas-kārī, 
which must denote a ‘maker of peśas,’ 
and peśas has not the sense of wrought 
gold in any passage. Cf. also Bṛhad

Altindisches Leben, 261. 10) Vedische Studien, 2, 113-125.

पेसितृ
पेसितृ
 is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 The sense is quite 
uncertain. The word is rendered by the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary and by Weber
	2 as ‘one who cuts in pieces,’ a 
‘carver,’ but Sāyaṇa
	3 thinks that it means one who causes an 
enmity which has been lulled to rest to break out again. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Bṛāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1. 2) Indische Streifen, 1, 75, n. 5. 3) On Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit.

पैङ्ग-राज
 is the name of one of the victims at the Aśva
medha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 That a 
bird is meant is certain, but what particular kind is quite 
unknown. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 13, 1;

पैङ्गीपुत्र
पैङ्गी-पुत्र
 (‘son of a female descendant of Piṅga’) is the 
name of a teacher, pupil of Śaunakīputra, in the last Vaṃśa 
(list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30 
Mādhyaṃdina).

पैङ्ग्य
पैङ्ग्य,
 ‘descendant of Piṅga,’ is the name of a teacher 
who is repeatedly mentioned as an authority in the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where
	2 also his doctrine is called the Paiṅgya. 
This teacher is further referred to in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 
which also speaks of Madhuka Paiṅgya.
	4 It is, of course, 
impossible to say whether there was only one Paiṅgya or several 
Paiṅgyas. The followers of Paiṅgya are called Paiṅgins in the 
Nidāna
	5 and Anupada
	6 Sūtras. His text-book is called Paiṅga 
in the Anupada Sūtra,
	7 while the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra
	8 
mentions a Paiṅgāyani Brāhmaṇa. It is clear that Paiṅgya 
was a teacher of a Rigveda school allied to the Kauṣītakis. 
Paiṅgi is a patronymic of Yāska in the Anukramanī of the 
Ātreyī Śākhā.

पैजवन
पैजवन,
 ‘descendant of Pijavana,’ is the patronymic of 
Sudās.
	1 It seems most probable that Pijavana intervened in 
the line of succession between Divodāsa and Sudās, because 
the two kings have, according to tradition, quite different 
Purohitas, the former being served by the Bharadvājas as his 
priests, the latter by Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra;
	2 this is more 
natural if they were divided by a period of time than if they had 
been, as is usually supposed, father and son. Geldner,
	3 how
ever, identifies Divodāsa and Pijavana. 1) Rv. vii. 18, 22. 25; Nirukta, ii. 24.

पोतृ
पोतृ
 is the name of one of the priests (Ṛtvij) of the sacri
ficial ritual. Already known to the Rigveda,
	1 he is frequently 
mentioned later in the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 But as Oldenberg
	3 
observes, the Potṛ is not in the later literature a priest of any 
importance, but is practically a mere name. Judging by the 
derivation of the name from the root pū, ‘purify,’ it would 
seem that he was properly engaged in the purification of the 
Soma pavamāna, ‘Soma purifying itself,’ and was perhaps 
employed to sing hymns to this Soma. Potra
	4 denotes both 
the office and the Soma vessel of the Potṛ.

पौंश्चलेय
पौंश्चलेय
 in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 8, 4, 2) denotes 
the son of a courtesan (Puṃśealī).

पौंसायन
पौंसायन
 is the patronymic of Duṣṭarītu in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa (xii. 9, 3, 1).

पौञ्जिष्ठ
पौञ्जि-ष्ठ
 is the form in the Atharvaveda,
	1 the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā,
	2 and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 of the word Puñjiṣṭha, 
denoting ‘fisherman.’ It is probably a caste name, ‘son of a 
Puñjiṣṭha,’ as the designation of a functional caste. 1) x. 4, 9. 2) xxx. 8. 3) iii. 4, 5, 1, where Sāyaṇa glosses it 
with the word kaivarta, also probably 
the name of a functional caste.

पौण्डरीक
पौण्डरीक
 is the patronymic of Kṣemadhṛtvan in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxii. 18, 7).

पौतक्रत
पौत-क्रत,
 ‘descendant of Pūtakratā,’ is the metronymic 
of a man, apparently Dasyave Vṛka, in the Rigveda.
	1 Schefte
lowitz
	2 proposes to read Pūtakratu with the Kashmir MS. of 
the Rigveda, arguing that in the same hymn Pūtakratāyī, the 
wife of Pūtakratu, is referred to, and that therefore Pūtakratu 
is appropriate, Pūtakratāyī
	3 being the feminine, like Manāyī,
	4 
for Manāvī. But the ordinary reading in the sense of descendant 
is perfectly legitimate, as Oldenberg
	5 has pointed out. 1) viii. 56, 2. 2) Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 41, 42. 3) See Pāṇini, iv. 1, 36. 4) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 8, 6; Pāṇini,

पौतिमाषीपुत्र
पौतिमाषी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Pūtimāṣa,’ 
is the metronymic of a teacher in the last Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 1).

पौतिमाष्य
पौति-माष्य,
 ‘descendant of Pūtimāṣa,’ is the patronymic of 
a teacher, a pupil of Gaupavana, in the first two Vaṃśas 
(lists of teachers) of the Kāṇva recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad (ii. 6, 1; iv. 6, 1).

पौतिमाष्यायण
पौतिमाष्यायण,
 ‘descendant of Pautimāṣya’ is the patro
nymic of a teacher, who, with Kauṇḍinyāyana, taught Raibhya, 
in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina 
recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26).

पौत्र
पौत्र
 (‘descended from a son’) is the regular term for a 
‘grandson’ from the Atharvaveda
	1 onwards.
	2 When it is used 
beside Naptṛ,
	3 the latter word must denote ‘great-grandson.’ 1) ix. 5, 30; xi. 7, 16; xviii. 43, 9. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 8, 3, etc. 3) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 3, 18;

Cf. Delbrūck, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 478.

पौर
पौर,
 ‘descendant of Pūru,’ is the name of a man, presum
ably a Pūru prince helped by Indra, in a hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 
The Greek  the name of Alexander's rival, is probably 
the representative of this word. Oldenberg
	2 sees the same 
name in another passage also.
	3 1) viii. 3, 12. 2) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 362; as also Grassmann, Wörterbuch, s.v. 3) v. 74, 4.

पौरुकुत्स
पौरु-कुत्स,
 
	1 Pauru-kutsi,
	2 
Pauru-kutsya,
	3 are variant 
forms of the patronymic of Trasadasyu, the descendant of 
Purukutsa. 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3. 2) Rv. vii. 19, 3. 3) Rv. v. 33, 8; viii. 19, 36; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3.

पौरुशिष्टि
पौरु-शिष्टि,
 ‘descendant of Puruśiṣṭa,’ is the patronymic of 
Taponitya in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (i. 9, 1 = Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka, vii. 8, 1).

पौर्णमासी
पौर्ण-मासी,
 denoting the ‘night of the full moon,’ is 
celebrated in the Atharvaveda
	1 as sacred, while it is repeatedly 
mentioned later.
	2 Gobhila
	3 defines it as the greatest separation 
(vikarṣa) of the sun and the moon. Cf. Māsa. 1) vii. 80. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 9, 1; ii. 2, 
2, 1; iii. 4, 9, 6; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
vii. 11; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 2, 4, 
etc. 3) i. 5, 7. Three sorts of full moon 
are distinguished by Gobhila — that 
which occurs when the full moon 
rises at the meeting of day and night 
(sandhyā), when it rises shortly after 
sunset, or when it stands high in the 
sky. The two former alternatives are 
apparently those described in the 
passage (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 11 = 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1) as pūrvā 
and uttarā. See Weber, Jyotiṣa, 51; 
Oldenberg, Sacred Books of the East, 
30, 26, n.

पौलुषि
पौलुषि,
 ‘descendant of Puluṣa,’ is the patronymic of Sat- 
yayajña in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 6, 1, 1) and the Chān
dogya Upaniṣad (v. 11, 1). In the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāh
maṇa (i. 39, 1) the form is Pauluṣita, which is perhaps merely 
an error.

पौल्कस
पौल्कस
 is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣa
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 The name also 
occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	2 as that of a despised 
race of men, together with the Cāṇḍāla. The Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā
	3 has the variant Puklaka or Pulkaka, clearly the same 
as Pulkasa, of which Paulkasa is a derivative form, showing 
that a caste is meant (cf. Kaulāla, Pauñjiṣṭha). In the accepted 
theory
	4 the Pulkasa is the son of a Niṣāda or Śūdra by a 
Kṣatriya woman, but this is merely speculative; the Paulkasa 
may either have been a functional caste, or, as Fick
	5 believes, 
an aboriginal clan living by catching wild beasts, and only 
occasionally reduced to menial tasks. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 17; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 14, 1. 2) iv. 3, 22. 3) i. 6, 11. 4) Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 
Pukkaśa. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
217, takes Paulkasa as a mixed caste. 5) Die sociale Gliederung, 206. Cf. 
Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 
416, n. 6.

पौष्करसादि
पौष्कर-सादि
 (‘descendant of Puṣkarasādi’) is the name of 
a teacher mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	1 as well as 
the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya.
	2 A Puṣkarasādi is mentioned in the 
Dharma Sūtra
	3 of Āpastamba and elsewhere. 1) vii. 17. Cf. Keith, Journal of the 
Royal Asiatic Society, 1908, 371. 2) i. 5; ii. 1, 2, 5; Pāṇini, viii. 4, 48;

पौष्पिण्ड्य
पौष्पिण्ड्य
 is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Jaimini, in 
the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the Sāmavidhāna 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 4, 377.

प्युक्ष्ण
प्युक्ष्ण
 is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 3, 1, 11) 
denoting the ‘covering’ for a bow (Dhanus), presumably made 
of skin.

प्रउग
प्रऊग
 is apparently equivalent to pra-yuga, denoting the 
fore part of the pole of the cart, the part in front of the yoke. 
It is mentioned in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 where it is said to be the part of the pole behind 
the Kastambhī, or prop on which the pole rests. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 11, 1, 2; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 4. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 2, 9; 
iii. 5, 3, 4, etc.

प्रकङ्कत
प्र-कङ्कत
 is the name of some noxious insect in the 
Rigveda.
	1 1) i. 191, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

प्रकरितृ
प्र-करितृ
 is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣa
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 The exact sense 
is uncertain; the commentator Sāyaṇa on the Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa explains it to mean the ‘divider of dear ones by producing 
enmity,’ but the sense of ‘sprinkler’ — that is, ‘seasoner’ — is 
more likely. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 8, 1. Cf. 
Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 
315, n. 1; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 
79, n. 6.

प्रकश
प्र-कश
 in the Atharvaveda (ix. 1, 21) seems to mean either 
the ‘thong’ or the ‘lash’ of a whip.

प्रक्रम
प्र-क्रम,
 ‘stride,’ is mentioned as a measure of distance 
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 2, 3, 1 et seq.), but its exact 
length in unknown.

प्रक्ष
प्रक्ष
 is the form in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 of the usual 
name, Plakṣa, of a tree, being merely a phonetic alteration for 
the sake of the etymology. According to Aufrecht,
	2 the same 
word is found in two passages of the Sāmaveda,
	3 the same 
reading occurring in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
	4 Oldenberg,
	5 
however, questions the correctness of the reading Prakṣa, 
both in the latter passage and in the Sāmaveda. 1) vi. 3, 10, 2. 2) Rigveda, 2, xlvi. n. 3) i. 444; ii. 465. 4) v. 2, 2, with Keith's notes. 5) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 344. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 59.

प्रगाथ
प्रगाथ
 is the name given in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka (ii. 2, 
2) to the poets of the eighth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, so called 
because they composed Pragātha strophes (that is, verses con
sisting of a Bṛhatī or Kakubh followed by a Satobṛhatī).

प्रघात
प्र-घात
 is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 in the sense of the closely woven ends of 
a cloth from which depend the loose threads of the Nīvi, or 
unwoven fringe. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 3; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiii. 1. The word 
does not occur in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
iii. 6, 2, 3. 2) iii. 1, 2, 18. 
Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 
26, 10, n. 1.

प्रचलाका
प्र-चलाका
 in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vii. 5, 11, 1) and the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (Aśvamedha, v. 2) seems to mean a ‘cloud
burst.’

प्रजावन्त्प्राजापत्य
प्रजावन्त् प्राजापत्य,
 ‘descendant of Prajāpati,’ is, according 
to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (i. 21), the author of a hymn of the 
Rigveda (x. 183).

प्रणपात्
प्र-णपात्
 in the Rigveda (viii. 17, 13) denotes ‘great
grandson.’

प्रणेजन
प्र-णेजन
 is the word used in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
(i. 2, 2, 18) to denote the ‘water used for washing.’

प्रततामह
प्र-ततामह,
 ‘great-grandfather,’ is found in the Athar
vaveda (xviii. 4, 75).

प्रतर्दन
प्र-तर्दन
 is the name in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	1 of a king 
who had a Bharadvāja for his Purohita. In the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 he appears as arriving at the sacrifice of the Ṛṣis in 
the Naimiṣa forest, and asking them how errors in the sacrifice 
could be remedied; and as finding Alīkayu Vācaspata, the 
Brahman priest at the sacrifice, unable to say what was to be 
done. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	3 it is said that Pratardana 
Daivodāsi went to Indra's world through his death in battle. 
The patronymic connects him with Divodāsa, the ancestor or 
father of Sudās, and the mention of Bharadvāja (probably ‘a 
Bharadvāja’ is meant) as his priest supports the patronymic, 
for Divodāsa is a special favourite of the singers of the Bharad
vāja family. The name, moreover, is reminiscent of the 
Tṛtsus (the root tard appears in both) and of the Pratṛdaḥ (see 
Pratṛd). But he is not in Vedic literature a king of Kāśi.
	4 
Geldner
	5 regards him as Divodāsa's son, but this is not likely. 
Cf. Prātardani. 1) xxi. 10. 2) xxvi. 5. 3) iii. 1. 4) As in the Epic; Pargiter, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1910, 38 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 138.

प्रतिथिदेवतरथ
प्र-तिथि देव-तरथ
 is the name of a teacher, pupil of 
Devataras Śāvasāyana in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 385; Max Müller, Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 444.

प्रतिदीवन्
प्रति-दीवन्
 denotes in the Rigveda (x. 38, 6) and the Athar
vaveda (vii. 109, 4) ‘opponent in the game of dice.’

प्रतिदुह्
प्रति-दुह्
 has the specific sense of ‘fresh milk,’ warm from 
the cow, in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 1) Av. ix. 4, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
ii. 5, 3, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 6,

3, 2; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 6, 2, 
etc.

प्रतिधा
प्रति-धा
 apparently means ‘draught’ or ‘pull’ in one 
passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where Indra is said to have drunk 
thirty streams (sarāṃsi) with one Pratidhā. 1) viii. 77, 4; Nirukta, v. 11.

प्रतिधि
प्रति-धि
 is mentioned in the Sūryā hymn of the Rigveda
	1 
as part of the chariot on which the bride is taken home. It is 
impossible to determine with certainty exactly what is meant; 
Roth
	2 understands it to mean a cross-piece of wood fastened to 
the pole. 1) x. 85, 8. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

प्रतिपण
प्रति-पण
 is found in the Atharvaveda (iii. 15, 4) denoting 
‘barter’ or ‘exchange.’ Cf. Paṇa.

प्रतिप्रश्न
प्रति-प्रश्न
 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 applied to 
Prajāpati as the decider of doubts; it may have been a technical 
term for an ‘arbitrator’ (cf. Madhyamaśī and harma). 1) i. 4, 5, 11; iv. 1, 3, 14; Eggeling, 
Sacred Books of the East, 12, 131, and 
26, 267, renders pratipraśnam by ‘(went 
to Prajāpati) for his decision,’ which 
leaves it ambiguous how he took the 
passages.

प्रतिप्रस्थातृ
प्रति-प्र-स्थातृ
 is the name of a priest (Ṛtvij), one of the 
assistants of the Adhvaryu, in the later Saṃhitās and the 
Brāhmaṇas.
	1 He is not mentioned in the Rigveda,
	2 but 
mention is once made in that Saṃhitā
	3 of the two Adhvaryus. 
These may have meant, as later, the Adhvaryu and the Prati
prasthātṛ. Oldenberg,
	4 however, thinks that the Adhvaryu and 
the Agnīdh are intended, a conjecture for which there is some 
authority.

प्रतिमित्
प्रति-मित्
 is found in the description of a house in the 
Atharvaveda.
	1 The sense must be ‘support’ of some sort, 
probably beams leaning up at an angle against the Upamits. 1) ix. 3, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 153; Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 596.

प्रतिश्रुत्का
प्रति-श्रुत्का,
 ‘echo,’ shows that this phenomenon had 
already received a name as early as the Yajurveda Saṃhitās

प्रतिष्ठा
प्रति-ष्ठा
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	1 
where Zimmer
	2 thinks the word is used as a technical term of 
law; possibly a ‘sanctuary’ may be meant, but it is more than 
doubtful whether the sense of ‘home’ or ‘abode,’ as given by 
Roth,
	3 is not quite adequate. Cf. Jñātṛ. 1) vi. 32, 3 = viii. 8, 21 = Śāṅkhāyana

प्रतिसर
प्रति-सर
 is used in several passages of the Atharvaveda
	1 
and later
	2 to denote an amulet, according to Roth,
	3 because it 
was a band, and so returned on itself (prati-sṛ, ‘go back’). The 
sense is doubtful; perhaps ‘attacking’ may really be the root 
idea.

प्रतीदर्शश्वैक्न
प्रती-दर्श श्वैक्न
 is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	1 as sacrificing with the Dākṣāyaṇa offering, and as 
teaching Suplan Sārñjaya, who thence became Sahadeva 
Sārñjaya. In a second passage
	2 he is called Pratīdarśa 
Aibhāvata, and again brought into connexion with Suplan 
Sārñjaya. According to Eggeling,
	3 he is to be deemed a king 
of the Śviknas; apparently, too, he was a descendant of 
Ibhāvant. A Pratīdarśa is also mentioned in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.

प्रतीपप्रातिसत्वन
प्रतीप प्रातिसत्वन,
 
	1 or Prātisutvana,
	2 is the name of a 
man mentioned in a hymn of the Atharvaveda.
	2 Zimmer,
	3 with 
great ingenuity, compares the fact that Parikṣit is mentioned 
as a Kuru king in the Atharvaveda,
	4 and that, according to the 
Epic genealogies, his grandson was Pratiśravas, with which 
name Prātisutvana, as very possibly a Prākritized version of 
Prātiśrutvana may be compared, and his great-grandson was 
Pratīpa. The identification cannot, however, be regarded as at 
all certain, and while the Epic may have derived its genealogy 
from the Atharvaveda, it may have preserved an independent 
tradition. Böhtlingk
	5 renders prātisatvanam as ‘in the direction 
opposed to the Satvans’, and this may be right. 1) So Khila, v. 15, 1; Aitareya Brāh
maṇa, vi. 33, 2. 2) So Av. xx. 129, 2. Cf. Scheftelo

प्रतीबोध
प्रती-बोध
 is mentioned with Bodha in two passages of the 
Atharvaveda,
	1 apparently as the name of a very mythic Ṛṣi, 
‘Intelligence.’ 1) v. 30, 10; viii. 1, 13. Cf. Mānava Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 15, 1.

प्रतृद्
प्रतृद्
 occurs once in the plural in a hymn of the Ṛgveda,
	1 
where it is clearly a variant of the word Tṛtsu. Moreover, the 
name of King Pratardana, a descendant of the Tṛtsu king, 
Divodāsa, confirms the identification of Tṛtsu and Pratṛd.

Rigveda, 3, 159; Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 138.

प्रतोद
प्र-तोद
 denotes in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 the ‘goad’ of the Vrātya, the non-Brahminical 
Āryan or aborigine. Later the word is regularly used for 
‘goad’ in general. 1) xv. 2, 1. 2) xvii. 1, 14. See Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇ
yaka, xii. 8; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
xxii. 4, 10; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
viii. 6, 7; Śāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, 
xiv. 72, 3. The rendering ‘lance’ 
seems to have no authority. But see 
Weber, Indian Literature, 67.

प्रत्यक्षदर्शन
प्रत्यक्ष-दर्शन,
 n., means ‘seeing with one's own eyes,’ 
as opposed to seeing in a vision (svapna). A section on such 
visions appears in the Rigveda Āraṇyakas.
	1 1) Aitareva Āranyaka, iii. 2, 4; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 7.

प्रत्येनस्
प्रत्य्-एनस्
 is found with Ugra and Sūta-grāmaṇī in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	1 clearly denoting an officer of police. 
The sense must be that of the humbler ‘servants’ of the king
	2 
rather than ‘magistrates,’ as Max Müller, in his translation, 
takes it. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	3 and the Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra
	4 the word means, according to the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, the next heir, who is responsible for the debts of a 
dead man. 1) iv. 3, 43. 44 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 3, 
37. 38 Kāṇva). 2) Böhtlingk's Translation, p. 66, 
where he takes ugra as an adjective. 3) viii. 4 (Indische Studien, 3, 463). 4) iv. 16, 16. 17.

प्रदर
प्र-दर
 in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 denotes 
a ‘cleft’ in the ground. 
^1 Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 8, 5; 
v. 2, 4, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 7. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 35, 1; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 10, 7; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 2, 3, 8; xiii. 8, 
3, 10, etc.

प्रदिव्
प्र-दिव्
 in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 2, 48) is the third and 
highest heaven, in which the Fathers dwell. In the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa (xx. 1) it is the fifth of a series of seven heavens.

प्रदिश्
प्र-दिश्,
 like Diś, normally designates only a ‘quarter’ of the 
sky, or ‘point’ of the compass. Four,
	1 five,
	2 six,
	3 and seven
	4 
such points are enumerated, or more generally ‘all’ are 
mentioned.
	5 In some passages,
	6 on the other hand, the word 
has the definite sense of an ‘intermediate quarter,’ which is 
more precisely denoted by avāntara-diś. 1) Rv. i. 164, 42; vii. 35, 8; x. 19, 8; 
Av. i. 11, 2; ii. 10, 3. 2) Rv. ix. 86, 29; Av. i. 30, 4; iii. 4, 2; 
20, 9. 3) Av. iv. 11, 1; 20, 2; x. 7, 35. 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 32. 5) Rv. vi. 75, 2; x. 121, 4. 6) Av. v. 28, 2; ix. 2, 21; xix. 20, 2, 
etc.

प्रधन
प्र-धन
 denotes ‘contest,’ whether the real conflict of war 
or the competition of the chariot race, in the Rigveda.
	1 1) i. 116, 2; 154, 3; 169, 2; x. 102, 5, etc.

प्रधि
प्र-धि
 is the name of some part of the wheel of a chariot, 
probably the ‘felly.’ In one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 and in 
one of the Atharvaveda,
	2 the ‘nave’ (Nabhya) and the ‘felly’ 
(pradhi) are mentioned along with the Upadhi, which must then 
be either a collective name for the spokes or an inner rim within 
the felly and binding the spokes. In the riddle hymn of the 
Rigveda
	3 twelve Pradhis are mentioned with three naves, one 
wheel, and three hundred and sixty spokes; what exactly is 
here meant by this particular term it would be useless to con
jecture, though it is clear that the passage as a whole symbolizes 
the year with three seasons, twelve months, and three hundred 
and sixty days. Elsewhere
	4 the nave and the Pradhi alone are 
mentioned, or the Pradhi occurs by itself.
	5 1) ii. 39, 4. 2) vi. 70, 3. 3) i. 164, 48. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 11, 2; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 15; Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 23. 5) Rv. iv. 30, 15; x. 102, 7, etc. In 
Av. xviii. 2, 14, Pradhāv adhi is merely 
an incorrect variant of the pradhāvati 
of Rv. x. 154, 1. The same corrup
tion is seen by Lanman (in Whitney's 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, xcii) 
in Av. vi. 70, 3 (n. 2). 
Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 334; Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 248.

प्रध्वंसन
प्र-ध्वंसन
 See Prādhvaṃsana

प्रपण
प्र-पण
 in the Atharvaveda (xii. 15, 4. 5) denotes ‘barter’ 
or ‘exchange,’ balanced by Pratipaṇa.

प्रपथ
प्र-पथ
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	2 
denotes a ‘long journey.’ Wilson
	3 has seen in one passage
	4 
the sense of ‘resting-place,’ where travellers can obtain food 
(khādi). Zimmer
	5 shows that this is impossible, and the 
reading (prapatheṣu) in the passage in question is not improb
ably
	6 an error for prapadeṣu. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	7 the 
word means a ‘broad road.’ 1) x. 17, 4. 6; 63, 16. 2) vii. 15. 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 2, 151. 4) Rv. i. 166, 9. 5) Altindisches Leben, 231. 6) Roth. St. Petersburg Dictionary,

Dictionary, s.v., does not follow Roth. 7) xxxvii. 14 (Indische Studien, 3, 466).

प्रपथिन्
प्र-पथिन्
 
	1 is the name of a patron, perhaps a Yādava, in 
one hymn of the Rigveda.
	2 1) Prapathī might be the stem, the 
word occurring as a proper name in 
the nominative singular only (cf. Mac
donell, Vedic Grammer, 377, 3); but 
this is not probable, the stem prapathin 
being otherwise found as an adjective 2) viii. 1, 30. Cf. Ludwig, Transla
tion of the Rigveda, 3, 159; Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
17, 90.

प्रपा
प्र-पा
 seems to denote a ‘spring’ in the desert in the only 
Rigveda passage where it occurs.
	1 In the Atharvaveda
	2 it has 
merely the sense of ‘drinking,’ or a ‘drink.’ 1) x. 4, 1. 2) iii. 30, 6. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 1, 2.

प्रपितामह
प्र-पितामह,
 ‘great-grandfather,’ is found in the later 
Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 5, 1; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 36; Av. xviii. 4, 35. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 16; 
xii. 8, 1, 7.

प्रपित्व
प्र-पित्व
 is found in several passages of the Rigveda as a 
designation of time. In one passage
	1 the sense is made clear 
by the context: ‘at the rising of the sun’ (sūra udite), ‘at mid
day’ (madhyaṃdine divaḥ), and ‘at the Prapitva, bordering on 
the night’ (apiśarvare). In another passage
	2 the sense of ‘late 
in the day’ also seems adequate, while the phrase
	3 abhipitve 
ahnaḥ, ‘at the close of day,’ also denotes the evening. According 
to Geldner,
	4 the sense of the word is the ‘decisive moment’ in 
a race or a battle, and so the ‘end of the day.’
	5 Cf. Ahan. 1) viii. 1, 29. 2) vii. 41, 4. 3) iv. 16, 12. 4) Vedische Studien, 2, 174 et seq. 5) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v., took it to mean ‘daybreak’; so 
also Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 362. 
Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., on the other 
hand, gives the meaning as ‘decline of 
day,’ ‘evening.’ See also Bloomfield, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
16, 24 et seq.; Oldenberg, Sacred Books 
of the East, 46, 183 et seq.

प्रप्रोथ
प्र-प्रोथ
 is the name in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (viii. 
4, 1) of a plant used as a substitute for Soma.

प्रफर्वी
प्र-फर्वी
 denotes a ‘wanton woman’ in the Rigveda 
(x. 85, 22), the Atharvaveda (v. 22, 7), and the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 5, 6; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 7, 12; Kāṭhaka

xii. 71.

प्रबुध्
प्र-बुध्,
 occurring in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 27, 
19), is used in the locative parallel with nimruci, ‘at the setting 
(of the sun),’ and clearly means ‘at the rising (of the sun).’

प्रमगन्द
प्र-मगन्द
 is the name of a prince in the Rigveda,
	1 where 
he is mentioned as the king of the Kīkaṭas, and where he 
seems to be designated by the epithet naicāśākha, ‘belonging 
to a low branch or race.’ On the other hand, Yāska
	2 takes 
Pramaganda to mean the ‘son of a usurer,’ an explanation that 
is hardly probable. Hillebrandt
	3 thinks that naicāśākha refers 
not to Pramaganda, but to the Soma plant, the plant being 
called nīcāśākha, ‘having shoots turned downwards,’ and that 
the passage refers to a raid against the Kīkaṭas, who were not 
observers of the milk cult or the Soma cult, with the intention 
of winning their lands where the Soma grew and where there 
were cows. Böhtlingk,
	4 however, questions this view, which is 
not very probable. A place name is possibly meant by Naicā
śākha.
	5 The name Pramaganda seems un-Āryan. 1) iii. 53, 14. 2) Nirukta, vi. 32. 3) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-16.

प्रमन्दनी
प्र-मन्दनी
 is the name of an Apsaras in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
Probably the word primarily denoted a certain sweet-scented 
plant, which seems to be the sense of pra-manda in the Kauśika 
Sūtra.
	2 1) iv. 37, 3. 2) viii. 17; xxv. 11; xxxii. 29; niṣpra- 
manda, xxxvi. 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altin-

प्रमर
प्र-मर
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 is taken by Ludwig
	2 
to be a proper name. 1) x. 27, 20. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 165.

प्रमोत
प्र-मोत
 is the name of some sort of disease in the Athar
vaveda,
	1 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Zimmer,
	2 
however, thinks that the word must be an adjective meaning 
‘dumb.’ This view is accepted, though with doubt, by 
Whitney
	3 and by Bloomfield.

	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 10, 1; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10 (Indische Studien, 
3, 478).

प्रयोग्य
प्र-योग्य
 denotes in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (viii. 12, 3) 
an animal yoked to a carriage, ‘draught animal.’

प्रलाप
प्र-लाप,
 ‘prattle,’ is found with other words of similar 
import in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and in the Brāhmaṇas
	2 of the 
Rigveda. The phrase Aitaśa-pralāpa, ‘Discourse of Aitaśa,’ 
occurs as a designation of certain passages of the Atharvaveda.
	3 
The name has no justification in the text itself. 1) xi. 8, 25. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33; Kauṣī
taki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5; Śāṅkhāyana

Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, ii. 23; Muṇḍaka 
Upaniṣad, iii. 2, 3, etc.

प्रवत्
प्र-वत्,
 ‘height,’ is contrasted with Nivat, ‘valley,’ in the 
Rigveda,
	1 where it occurs several times.
	2 The word is also 
found later.
	3 1) vii. 50, 4. 2) Rv. ii. 13, 2; iv. 17, 7; 22, 4; vi. 17,

x. 10, 2; xii. 1, 2; xviii. 4, 7.

प्रवर
1. Pra-vara denotes properly the ‘summons’ addressed to 
Agni at the beginning of the sacrifice to perform his functions. 
But as Agni was then invoked by the names of the ancestors of 
the Purohita,
	1 the term Pravara denotes the series of ancestors 
invoked.
	2 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 25. See 
Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 78. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 1, 9;

etc.

प्रवर
2. Pra-vara, 
	1 or Pra-vāra,
	2 denotes a ‘covering’ or ‘woollen 
cloth’ in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 10. 
in the Mādhyaṃdina recension. 2) Sāyaṇa on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upani
ṣad, loc. cit.; and Kāṇva recension, 
vi. 2, 7.

प्रवर्त
प्र-वर्त,
 occurring in the description of the Vrātya in the 
Atharvaveda (xv. 2, 1, et seq.), is explained by the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary as a ‘round ornament.’ According to the com
mentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (2, 453 Bibl. Ind.), it means 
an ‘ear-ring.’

प्रवल्हिका
प्र-वल्हिका,
 a ‘riddle,’ is the name given in the Brāhmaṇas 
of the Rigveda
	1 to certain verses of the Atharvaveda.
	2 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 33; Kauṣī
taki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 7. 2) xx. 133; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
xii. 22; Khila, v. 16. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 98-100.

प्रवात
प्र-वात,
 ‘a windy spot,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as 
the place where the Vibhītaka nuts, used as dice (Akṣa) grow. 
In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	2 reference is made to the exposure of 
decaying matter in such a place. 1) x. 34, 1; Nirukta, ix. 8. Geldner, 
Rigveda, Glossar, 119, thinks the refer
ence here is to nuts being blown down 
in a storm of wind. 2) vi. 4, 7, 2.

प्रवार
प्र-वार
 See 2. Pravara.

प्रवास
प्र-वा̆स,
 ‘dwelling abroad,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda.
	1 
Ceremonies applicable to one who has returned from foreign 
residence are given in the Sūtras.
	2 1) viii. 29, 8. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 15; 
Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 17, 
etc.

प्रवाहणजैवलि
प्र-वाहण जैवलि
 or Jaivala (‘descendant of Jīvala’) is 
the name of a prince, contemporary with Uddālaka, who 
appears in the Upaniṣads
	1 as engaged in philosophical dis
cussions. He is probably identical with the Jaivali of the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	2 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 
1. 7 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 2, 1, 4 Kāṇva); 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 8, 1; v. 
3, 1. 2) i. 38, 4.

प्रशस्
प्र-शस्
 in a Mantra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes, 
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, an ‘axe,’ or some 
similar instrument for cutting.
	2 1) ii. 6, 5. Cf. Durga on Nirukta, v. 11. 2) From śas, ‘to cut.’

प्रशास्तृ
प्र-शास्तृ
 is the name of one of the priests (Ṛtvij) at the 
Vedic sacrifice. In the lesser sacrifices he plays no part at all, 
but he appears in the animal (paśu) and Soma sacrifices, in the 
former as the only, in the latter as the main, assistant of the 
Hotṛ priest in the singing of the litanies. He is mentioned by 
name in the Rigveda,
	1 and often later.
	2 He is also in the 
Rigveda
	3 called Upavaktṛ, this name, like Praśāstṛ, being 
derived from the fact that one of his chief functions was to 
issue directions (praiṣa) to the other priests. Another name 
for him was Maitrāvaruṇa, because his litanies were mainly 
addressed to Mitra and Varuṇa, a connexion already visible in 
the Rigveda.
	4 The ‘two divine Hotṛs’ of the Āprī litanies 
denote, according to Oldenberg,
	5 the heavenly counterparts of 
the Hotṛ and the Praśāstṛ. 1) i. 94, 6; ii. 5, 4; praśāstra, ‘the 
Soma bowl of the Praśāstṛ,’ 36, 6; 
praśāstra, ‘the office of the Praśāstṛ,’ 
ii. 1, 2 = x, 91, 10. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 21; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, v. 34; Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, iv. 6, 6, 6; xi. 5, 5, 9, etc. 3) iv. 9, 5; vi. 71, 5; ix. 95, 5. 
According to Ludwig, Translation of 
the Rigveda, 3, 226, the Upavaktṛ is 
the earliest equivalent of the Ashāvāka. 4) ii. 36, 6. 5) Religion des Veda, 391. Ludwig, 
op. cit., 3, 227, identifies the Praśāstṛ 
with the Prastotṛ, but this is most 
improbable. 
Cf. Oldenberg, op. cit., 383, 390, 391; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 141 et seq.

प्रश्न
प्रश्न
 denotes generally ‘enquiry’ or ‘disputed question,’ 
the phrase praśnam eti having the sense ‘he asks a person for 
the decision of a disputed point’ in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 
and elsewhere.
	2 Thus Praśna comes to have the definite 
meaning of ‘decision in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 In the list 
of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda
	4 are included the Praśnin, the Abhi-praśnin, and the 
Praśna-vivāka; it is quite likely that here the three parties to a 
civil case are meant — the plaintiff, the defendant, and the 
arbitrator or judge (Madhyamaśī). 1) ii. 5, 8, 5; 11, 9. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 6, 2; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 28. 3) v. 14. 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 10; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 6, 1.

प्रष्टि
प्रष्टि,
 like Pṛṣṭyā, denotes a ‘side horse,’ which, however, 
possibly
	1 did not necessarily mean a horse running beside the 
yoke-horses, but may also have meant a third horse yoked in 
front as a leader. This seems to be indicated by the reference 
in the Rigveda
	2 to the Praṣṭi — here applied to the Maruts’ 
team — leading (vahati) the team (rohitaḥ). In an obscure 
passage of the Atharvaveda
	3 there is a reference to the Praṣṭis 
in connexion with a pañca-vāhī, ‘drawn by five,’ but it is 
impossible to gain any clear idea of what is meant. The 
Praṣṭi is not rarely referred to elsewhere.
	4 In one passage
	5 the 
dhuryau and the praṣṭyau are mentioned together; this probably 
means the two horses yoked to the pole, with two others 
fastened in some way one on each side. The adjectives praṣṭi- 
mant,
	6 praṣṭi-vāhana,
	7 praṣṭi-vāhin,
	8 are all used of Ratha, ‘chariot,’ 
meaning ‘drawn by a side horse (or horses)’ in addition to the 
yoke-horses. Cf. Ratha. 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) i. 39, 6; viii. 27, 8. In i. 100, 17, 
praṣṭibhiḥ seems to refer to the assistants 
or comrades of Ṛjrāśva (cf. Lāṭyāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 12, 14); but Ludwig 
thinks that the word refers to the steeds 
by which a victory was won. 3) x. 8, 8. Cf. Whitney, Translation

what is offered.

प्रस्कण्व
प्र-स्कण्व
 is the name of a Ṛṣi who is credited by the 
Anukramaṇī (Index) with the authorship of certain hymns of 
the Rigveda,
	1 where
	2 he is mentioned several times. The 
statement in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	3 that he obtained 
bounty from Pṛṣadhra Medhya Mātariśvan is apparently a 
blunder.

प्रस्तोक
प्र-स्तोक
 is the name of a generous donor in the Rigveda,
	1 
where Ludwig
	2 identifies him with Divodāsa Atithigva and 
Aśvattha or Aśvatha. According to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra,
	3 Bharadvāja obtained gifts from Prastoka Sārñjaya, 
‘descendant of Sṛñjaya.’ 1) vi. 47, 22. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158. 3) xvi. 11, 11.

प्रस्तोतृ
प्र-स्तोतृ
 is the name of an assistant of the Udgātṛ priest 
who sings the Prastāva,
	1 or prelude of the Sāman chant. His 
not being mentioned by name in the Rigveda is merely an 
accident, for he is clearly referred to in one passage,
	2 and in the 
later literature
	3 he is a frequent figure. Ludwig
	4 erroneously 
thinks that Praśāstṛ is the earlier name of the Prastotṛ. 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xii. 10, 7;

 is the name of a teacher in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 
(xxvi. 4) according to Lindner's edition. Cf. Prāvahi.

प्राचीनतान
प्राचीन-तान
 denotes the ‘warp’ of a piece of cloth in the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vi. 1, 1, 4). Cf. Prācīnātāna.

प्राचीनयोगीपुत्र
प्राचीन-योगी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Prācīna
yoga,’ is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Sāṃjīvīputra in the 
last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension 
of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 32).

प्राचीनयोग्य
प्राचीन-योग्य,
 ‘descendant of Prācīnayoga,’ is the name 
of a teacher, a pupil of Pārāśarya, in the first Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 A Prācīnayogya 
is mentioned also in the Chāndogya
	2 and the Taittirīya
	3 
Upaniṣads, and the same patronymic is found in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	4 and in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (see 
Puluṣa, Satyayajña,
	5 Somaśuṣma). 1) ii. 6, 2 (Kāṇva) . 2) v. 13, 1. 3) i. 6, 2. 4) (Of Satyayajña Pauluṣi) x. 6, 1, 5; 
(of Śauceya) xi. 5, 3, 1. 8 (cf. Gopatha 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 11). Cf. Weber, Indische 
Studien, 1, 61; 2, 213; 3, 274. 5) Called Prācīnayoga in i. 39, 1, but 
this is probably merely a blunder of 
the manuscript.

प्राचीनवंश
प्राचीन-वंश
 as an adjective denotes ‘having the support
ing beam of the roof facing the east’ in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	2 The reference is 
to the central beam running from the middle of the western 
end of a hall to the middle of the eastern end. This beam was 
possibly higher than those at the side. 1) iii. 1, 1, 6. 7; 6, 1, 23; iv. 6, 8,

mentioned in the same Upaniṣad.
	3 1) v. 11, 1. See Mahāśāla. 2) iii. 7, 2; 10, 2. 3) iii. 10, 1.

प्राचीनातान
प्राचीनातान,
 denoting the ‘warp’ of a piece of cloth, is 
found in the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 Cf. Prācīnatāna. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 12, 3; 
17, 2; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 5 
(cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 20, 
n. 2).

प्राचीनावीत
प्राचीनावीत
 
	1 denotes the wearing of the sacred thread of the 
Āryan over the right shoulder and under the left arm, Prācīnā
vītin
	2 being the name for the man so wearing the thread. 
Tilak,
	3 however, thinks that these terms do not imply the 
wearing of a thread, but of a garment. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 11, 1. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 6, 6; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 2, 2.

has the same sense in Av. ix. 1, 
24. 3) Orion, 146, citing Taittirīya Āraṇ
yaka, ii. 1.

प्राच्य
प्राच्य
 denotes in the plural ‘dwellers in the east.’ They 
are mentioned in the list of peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 
It is very probable that the Kāśis, Kosalas, Videhas, and 
perhaps Magadhas, are meant, as Oldenberg
	2 supposes. In 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 the Easterns are said to call Agni 
by the name of Śarva, and their mode of making tombs is 
there
	4 referred to with disapproval. The Lāṭyāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	5 explains the Vipatha, ‘rough car,’ of the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	6 as a car of the Easterns (prācya-ratha). In the 
Saṃhitopaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	7 reference is made to the Prācya
Pāñcālas. 1) viii. 14. 2) Buddha, 393, n. 3) i. 7, 3, 8. 4) xiii. 8, 1, 5; 2, 1. Cf. also ix. 5, 
1, 64. These passages render improb
able the earlier view of Weber (Indian 
Literature, 132, 133) that this Brāhmaṇa 
is a product of the Eastern peoples, and 
support his later view that the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, like the other great 
Brāhmaṇas, belongs to the Madhyadeśa 
(see Kuru, n. 1). 5) viii. 6, 9. 6) xvii. 1. 7) 2; Weber, Indian Literature, 34, 
n. 25.

प्रजापत्य
प्रजापत्य,
 ‘descendant of Prajāpati,’ is only a patronymic 
of mythical persons like Āruṇi Suparṇeya (‘descendant of 
Suparṇā’) in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (x. 79), or of Prajāvant 
in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (i. 21).

प्राण
प्राण,
 properly denoting ‘breath,’ is a term of wide and 
vague significance in Vedic literature. It is frequently men
tioned from the Rigveda
	1 onwards; in the Āraṇyakas and 
Upaniṣads it is one of the commonest symbols of the unity of 
the universe.
	2 In the narrow sense Prāṇa denotes one of the 
vital airs, of which five are usually
	3 enumerated — Prāṇa, 
Apāna, Vyāna, Udāna, and Samāna; but often only two, 
Prāṇa and Apāna,
	4 or Prāṇa and Vyāna,
	5 or Prāṇa and Udāna;
	6 
or three, Prāṇa, Apāna, and Vyāna,
	7 or Prāṇa, Udāna, and 
Vyāna,
	8 or Prāṇa, Udāna, and Samāna;
	9 or four, Prāṇa, 
Apāna, Vyāna, and Samāna,
	10 or Prāṇa, Apāna, Udāna, 
Vyāna.
	11 The exact sense of each of these breaths when all 
are mentioned cannot be determined.

प्राण
प्राण
 is also used in a wider sense to denote the organs of 
sense,
	13 or as Sāyaṇa
	14 puts it, the ‘orifices of the head,’ etc. 
These are given as six in one passage of the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa,
	15 presumably the eyes, ears, and nostrils. More 
frequently there are stated to be seven in the head, the mouth 
being then included.
	16 Sometimes again they are mentioned 
as nine,
	17 or as seven in the head and two below.
	18 Ten are 
counted in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	19 and the Jaiminīya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	20 while even eleven are mentioned in the Kāṭhaka 
Upaniṣad,
	21 and twelve in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	22 where the 
two breasts are added. Exactly what organs are taken to 
make up the numbers beyond seven is not certain.
	23 The tenth 
is the navel (nābhi) in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā;
	24 when eleven 
are named the Brahma-randhra
	25 (suture in the crown) may be 
included; in the Atharvaveda,
	26 as interpreted by the Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	27 the seventh and eighth are the organs 
of taste and speech respectively. But usually these make one 
only, and the eighth and ninth are either in the breast
	28 or 
below (the organs of evacuation).
	29 
The word Prāṇa has sometimes merely the general sense of 
breath, even when opposed to Apāna.
	30 But its proper sense 
is beyond question ‘breathing forth,’ ‘expiration,’ and not as 
the St. Petersburg Dictionary explains it, ‘the breath inspired,’ 
a version due to the desire to interpret Apāna as ‘expiration,’ 
a meaning suggested by the preposition apa, ‘away.’ This 
being clearly shown both by the native scholiasts
	31 and by 
other evidence,
	32 Böhtlingk
	33 later accepted the new view. 13) Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays,

	1 the Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka,
	2 the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,

of the priests who sacrificed for the Ātreya Udamaya in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.

	2 
as priests who ‘knew all’ (sacrificial lore). Three Praiya
medhas are referred to in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 In the 
Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	4 they are called Bharadvājas. 1) viii. 22. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, vi. 1 (Indische

प्रोति कौशाम्बेय कौसुरु-बिन्दि
 (‘descendant of Kusuru- 
binda’) is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a pupil 
and contemporary of Uddālaka. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	2 on 
the other hand, Kusurubinda is called Auddālaki, ‘descendant 
of Uddālaka,’ a fact which seems to indicate that little value 
is to be attached to these patronymics and allegations of 
contemporaneousness. 1) xii. 2, 2, 13. In the parallel 
passage, Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 24, 
Predi Kauśāmbeya Kausuravinda is the 
form of the name. 2) vii. 2, 2, 1. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, p. 115.

 denoting perhaps a ‘bench,’ is found in the Rigveda
	1 
in the adjective proṣṭhaśaya, ‘lying on a bench,’ used of women, 
and uncompounded in the Taittīriya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the first 
passage it is distinguished from Talpa and Vahya, but what 
the exact difference was there is not sufficient evidence to 
show. 1) vii. 55, 8. 2) ii. 7, 17, 1. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 154.

infectoria), a large and beautiful tree with small white fruit. 
It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	2 
along with the Nyagrodha and the Parṇa. Its name is altered 
in the latter Saṃhitā
	3 to Prakṣa for the sake of an etymology. 
It is also mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas.
	4 1) v. 5, 5. 2) vii. 4, 12, 1. Cf. iii. 4, 8, 4;

प्लक्षप्रास्रवण
3. Plakṣa Prā-sravaṇa is the name of a locality, forty-four 
days’ journey from the spot where the Sarasvatī disappears. 
It is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In the latter text it is said 
that the middle of the earth is only a span (Prādeśa) to the 
north of it. In the Rigveda Sūtras
	3 the locality is called 
Plākṣa Prasravaṇa, and is apparently meant to designate the 
source of the Sarasvatī rather than the place of its reappearance. 1) xxv. 10, 16. 22; Kātyāyana Srauta

प्लव
2. Plava is the name of an aquatic bird mentioned in the 
list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 Perhaps the ‘pelican’ is meant. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 20, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 15; Vāja

प्लायोगि
प्ला-योगि,
 ‘descendant of Playoga,’ is the patronymic of 
Āsaṅga in the Rigveda.
	1 According to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra,
	2 Āsaṅga was a woman, but became a man. This version, 
repeated by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Rigveda,
	3 is a 
mere blunder based on the fact that an additional verse, tacked 
on to the hymn,
	3 contains the expression śaśvatī nārī, which 
has been taken to mean ‘his wife Śaśvatī,’
	4 instead of merely 
‘every woman.’ 1) viii. 1, 33. 2) xvi. 11, 17. 3) viii. 1, 34. Cf. Hopkins, Religions 
of India, 150. 3) viii. 1, 34. Cf. Hopkins, Religions

प्लाशुक
प्लाशुक
 is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v, 3, 3, 2)

rapidly.’

प्लीहाकर्ण
प्लीहा-कर्ण
 as an epithet of cattle in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās
	1 probably denotes ‘having a spleen-shaped mark 
branded on the ear,’ not as Mahīdhara in his commentary on 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	2 takes it, ‘having a disease called 
Plīhan in the ear.’ 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 13, 5 (cf. iv. 2, 9); Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 24. 2) Loc. cit.

(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,

may be meant. 1) i. 191, 1. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 8;

(i. 2, 6, 6).

फण
फण
 occurs in some manuscripts of the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,
	1 
and is explained as meaning an ‘ornament.’ But it is merely 
a misreading of the correct word phala in the compound phala- 
hastāḥ, ‘bearing fruits in their hands.’ 1) i. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 398; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 
19, n. 1.

फर्वर
फर्वर,
 a word occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 
cannot be interpreted with certainty. It may mean a ‘field in 
bloom.’
	2 Sāyaṇa
	3 explains it as ‘filler,’ and Grassmann as 
perhaps a ‘sower.’
	4 1) x. 106, 2. 2) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 260. 3) In his commentary on Rv. x. 106, 2. 
He explains the intensive form par- 
pharat, occurring in the same hymn 
(x. 106, 7), as from a verb meaning 
to ‘fill.’ 4) Wörterbuch, s.v.

फल
फल,
 denoting ‘fruit’ generally, especially the fruit of a

बकुर
बकुर
 is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
it is said that the Aśvins made light for the Āryan by blowing 
their Bakura against the Dasyus. According to the Nirukta,
	2 
the thunderbolt
	1 is meant; but much more probable is Roth's
	3 
view, that the object blown was a musical instrument. See 
also Bākura. 1) i. 117, 21. 2) vi. 25. Cf. Naighaṇṭuka, iv. 3. 1) i. 117, 21. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

बभ्रु
1. Babhru is the name, in the Rigveda,
	1 of a Ṛṣi who received 
gifts from King Ṛṇaṃcaya. The same Babhru may be meant 
in another passage,
	2 where he is mentioned as a protégé of the

at all in the Atharvaveda.

बम्बा-विश्ववयसौ
 are the names, in the form of a 
compound, of two Ṛṣis who, according to the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās,
	1 invented a certain rite. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6, 8, 4; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā xxix. 7, where the 
reading adopted in the text is Bambhā, 
though the reading of the Berlin manu
script is Bambhār. The name is taken 
to be Bambā by the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary; but Bamba is possible, the 
Dvandva compound accounting for the 
form with ā. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
iv. 7, 3, has Bamba-.

बरासी
बरासी
 is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	1 and the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmana
	2 denoting a garment of some kind. 1) xv. 4. 2) xviii. 9, 16 (where the com

teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) i. 1, 1, 10; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 8 (Mādhyaṃdina = iv. 1, 4 
Kāṇva).

बर्हिस्
बर्हिस्
 is found repeatedly in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 
denoting the litter of grass strewn on the sacrificial ground 
on which the gods are summoned to seat themselves. 1) i. 63, 7; 108, 4; iii. 4, 4, etc. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 4, 5;

बलाका,
 ‘crane,’ is mentioned in the list of victims at the 
Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.

बलास
बलास
 is the name of a disease mentioned several times in 
the Atharvaveda
	1 and occasionally later.
	2 Mahīdhara
	3 and 
Sāyaṇa
	4 interpret the term as ‘consumption.’ Zimmer
	5 supports 
this view on the ground that it is mentioned
	6 as a kind of 
Yakṣma, makes the bones and joints fall apart (asthi-sraṃsa, 
paruḥ-sraṃsa),
	7 and is caused by love, aversion, and the heart,
	8 
characteristics which agree with the statements of the later 
Hindu medicine.
	9 It is in keeping with a demon of the 
character of consumption that Balāsa should appear as an 
accompaniment of Takman.
	10 Grohmann,
	11 however, thought 
that a ‘sore’ or ‘swelling’ (in the case of fever caused by 
dropsy) was meant. Bloomfield
	12 considers that the question 
is still open. Ludwig
	13 renders the word by ‘dropsy.’ 
As remedies against the disease the salve (Āñjasa) from 
Trikakud
	14 and the Jaṅgiḍa
	15 plant are mentioned. 1) iv. 9, 8; v. 22, 11; vi. 14; 1; 127, 1;

बलि
बलि
 occurs several times in the Rigveda
	1 and often later
	2 
in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer
	3 
thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He 
compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus,
	4 where the 
kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents, 
but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground what
ever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of 
monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the 
tribesmen,
	5 but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially 
a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most 
improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods 
was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts. 
Zimmer admits that in the case of hostile tribes
	6 tribute must 
be meant even in the Rigveda. See also Rājan. 1) To a god, Rv. i. 70, 9; v. 1, 10; 
viii. 100, 9; to a king, in the compound

बल्कस
बल्कस
 denotes impure matter given off in the process of 
fermentation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The exact sense 
may be either ‘scum,’ ‘sediment,’
	2 or perhaps more probably 
vegetable matter in the form of ‘husks.’

बल्बज
बल्बज
 is the name of the grass called Eleusine indica. It 
is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and is said in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās
	2 to be produced from the excrements of cattle. In 
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	2 it is stated to be used for the sacrificial 
litter (Barhis) and for fuel. Baskets or other products made 
from this grass are referred to in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) 
in the Rigveda.

बल्हिक
1. Balhika is the name of a people in the Atharvaveda
	1 where 
the fever (Takman) is called upon to go to the Mūjavants, the 
Mahāvṛṣas, and the Balhikas. The Mūjavants are quite 
certainly a northern tribe, and though, as Bloomfield
	2 suggests, 
the passage may contain a pun on Balhika as suggesting 
‘outsider’ (from bahis, ‘without’), still no doubt the name was 
chosen from a northern tribe. But the view of Roth
	3 and 
Weber,
	4 which Zimmer
	5 once accepted, that an Iranian tribe 
is referred to (cf. Balkh), is not at all probable. Zimmer
	6 
shows that there is no need whatever to assume Iranian 
influence. See also Parśu. 1) v. 22, 5. 7. 9. 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 446. 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des

बल्हिकप्रातिपीय
2. Balhika Prātipīya is the name of a Kuru king in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where he appears as having been opposed 
to the restoration of Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana to his hereditary 
sovereignty over the Sṛñjayas, but as having failed to prevent 
the restoration being carried out by Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra 
Sthapati. The epithet Prātipīya is curious: if it connects him 
with Pratīpa (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is 
remarkable, Zimmer
	2 indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya. 
In the Epic and the Purāṇas
	3 he is in the form of Vāhlīka 
made a brother of Devāpi and Śantanu, and a son of Pratīpa. 
To base chronological conclusions on this
	4 would be utterly 
misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa 
and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown 
parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be 
a late figure in the Vedic age, later than Parikṣit, being his 
great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a 
descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name Balhika 
must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort 
regarding it. 1) xii. 9, 3, 3. 2) Altindisches Leben, 432. 3) See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 273 
et seq.; Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda,

Society, 1910, 52.

बल्बूथ
बल्बूथ
 is mentioned in one hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 along 
with Tarukṣa and Pṛthuśravas, as a giver of gifts to the singer. 
He is called a Dāsa, but Roth
	2 was inclined to amend the text 
so as to say that the singer received a hundred Dāsas from 
Balbūtha. Zimmer's
	3 suggestion that he may have been the 
son of an aboriginal mother, or perhaps an aboriginal himself, 
seems probable.
	4 If this was the case, it would be a clear 
piece of evidence for the establishment of friendly relations 
between the Āryans and the Dāsas. 1) viii. 46, 32. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. dāsa. 3) Altindisches Leben, 117. 4) Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual,

	1 and the later 
literature.
	2 1) i. 161, 13. The passage is unin
telligible; for a guess, see Tilak, Orion, 
166 et seq., and cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische

बाणवत्|बाणवन्त्
बाणवन्त्
 in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iii. 8, 2) denotes 
an ‘arrow’ like Bāṇa. Its more normal sense is ‘quiver’ (lit., 
‘containing arrows’), which is its sense in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā (xvi. 10) and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 3, 1, 11).

of Śunaḥśepa
	2 the Kāpileyas and the Bābhravas are enumerated 
as the descendants of Śunaḥśepa under his adoptive name of 
Devarāta Vaiśvāmitra. A Sāman, or Chant, of Babhru is 
mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

metaphorical sense the term is used in the Upaniṣads of the 
classes of beings according to origin, of which the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad

	4 four. The former 
list includes aṇḍa-ja, ‘egg-born,’ jīva-ja, ‘born alive,’ and 
udbhij-ja, ‘produced from sprouts,’ ‘germinating,’ while the 
latter adds sveda-ja, ‘sweat-born’ — that is, ‘generated by hot 
moisture,’ an expression which is glossed to comprise flies, 
worms, etc. Cf. Kṛṣi. 1) x. 94, 13; 101, 3. Cf. metaphoric

	2 Upaniṣads, he was 
a contemporary of Janaka of Videha, and, according to the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 of Aśvapati, the Kekaya king. He is 
also mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.^4 1) v. 11, 1; 16, 1. 2) v. 15, 11 (Mādhyaṃdina = v. 14, 
8 Kāṇva). 3) x. 6, 1, 1. Cf. iv. 6, 1, 9. 
vi. 30.

बुधसौमायन
बुध सौमायन,
 ‘descendant of Soma,’ is the name of a 
teacher mentioned in a verse in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxiv. 18, 6. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts 
and Sciences, 15, 55, n. 2.

बुन्द
बुन्द
 means ‘arrow’ in a few passages of the Rigveda.
	1 1) viii. 45, 4; 77, 6. 11. Cf. Nirukta, vi. 32.

बृबु
बृबु
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 where he is 
described as a most generous giver (sahasra-dātama), and as at 
the head of the Paṇis. According to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra,
	2 Bharadvāja received gifts from Bṛbu Takṣan and 
Prastoka Sārñjaya, a fact alluded to in the Mānava Dharma 
Śāstra,
	3 where takṣan is treated as a descriptive attribute, 
‘a carpenter.’ Apparently Bṛbu was a Paṇi, though the words 
of the Rigveda
	1 might be taken to mean that he was one who 
had overthrown them entirely. If so, Paṇi must here certainly 
mean a merchant in a good sense, Bṛbu being then a merchant 
prince.
	4 According to Weber,
	5 the name suggests connexion 
with Babylon, but this conjecture must be regarded as 
quite improbable. Hillebrandt
	6 sensibly expresses no opinion 
as to Bṛbu, while Brunnhofer's
	7 attempt to recognize a 
people named , and to connect them with the 
Vedic word takṣan, is valueless, especially considering the 
fact that Takṣan is not found as an epithet of Bṛbu in the 
Rigveda. 1) vi. 45, 31. 33. 2) xvi. 11, 11. 3) x. 107. 1) vi. 45, 31. 33. 4) Cf. Griffith, Hymns of the Rigveda,

Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1898, 
563, n. 1; Indische Studien, 17, 198. 
The Bāveru Jātaka, on which stress is 
laid in connexion with the Indian know
ledge of Babylon, being of quite un
known date, has no cogency as evidence 
for any early period. Cf. Bühler, Indische 
Palœographie, 17-19; Indische Studien, 3, 
79 et seq.; Weber, Indian Literature 3;

बृसय
बृसय
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda, being in the first 
passage
	1 connected with the Paṇis, and in the second
	2 with the 
Pārāvatas and the Paṇis. According to the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, the word is the name of a demon,
	3 but is in the 
second passage
	2 used as an appellative, perhaps meaning 
‘sorcerer.’
	4 Hillebrandt
	5 thinks that a people is meant 
locating them in Arachosia or Drangiana with the Pārāvatas 
and the Paṇis, and comparing , satrap of Arachosia 
and Drangiana in the time of Darius.
	6 But this theory is not 
probable. 1) i. 93, 4. 2) vi. 61, 3. 3) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Rv., loc., cit. 2) vi. 61, 3. 4) Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v., follow

बृसी
बृसी,
 denoting a ‘cushion’ of grass, is mentioned in the 
Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	1 and the Sūtras.
	2 The incorrect forms 
Vṛśī and Vṛṣī also occur occasionally. 1) i. 2, 4; v. 1, 3, with Keith's note;

6, 6; Kātyāyana Srauta Sūtra, xiii. 3, 1.

बृहच्छन्दस्
बृहच्-छन्दस्
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 
as an epithet of Śālā, ‘house.’ It is apparently
	2 an error for 
bṛhad-chadis, ‘broad-roofed,’ which in any case is the sense.
	3 1) iii. 12, 3. 2) Cf. Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 105. 3) Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharva- 
veda, 345.

बृहत्सामन्
बृहत्-सामन्
 is mentioned in the Atharvaveda (v. 19, 2) as 
an Āṅgirasa who was oppressed by Kṣatriyas. The latter are 
said to have been ruined in consequence. Cf. Sṛñjaya and 
Bārhatsāmā.

बृहदुक्थ
बृहद्-उक्थ
 is mentioned in an obscure hymn of the 
Rigveda
	1 as a priest; in two hymns of the tenth Maṇḍala
	2 he 
is definitely a Ṛṣi. He is also mentioned in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	3 as having consecrated Durmukha Pāñcāla, and 
is called Vāmadeva's son in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	4 In the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	5 he appears as Vāmneya, ‘descendant 
of Vāmnī.’ Hopkins
	6 suggestion that he may have been there 
thought of as Vāmadevya also is quite probable.

is parallel with xiv. 9, 38.

बृहद्गिरि
बृहद्-गिरि
 is said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (viii. 1, 4) 
to have been one of the three Yatis who survived the slaughter 
of them by Indra. A Sāman, or Chant, of his is mentioned in 
the same Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 4, 15-17).

बृहद्दिव
बृहद्-दिव
 appears in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as its author, 
calling himself an Atharvan. He is mentioned in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 and is named in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the 
Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	3 as a pupil of Sumnayu. 1) x. 120, 8. 9. 2) iv. 14. 3) xv. 1. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 133; Macdonell, Vedic Myth- 
ology, p. 141.

बृहद्रथ
बृहद्-रथ
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda,
	1 in both 
cases beside Navavāstva. The name may thus be an epithet 
of Navavāstva. 1) i. 36, 18; x. 49, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 147, 148.

बृहद्वसु
बृहद्-वसु
 is the name of a teacher in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 374.

बृहस्पति
बृहस्पति,
 ‘lord of prayer,’ is the name of a god in the 
Vedic texts. The view of Thibaut,
	1 that the name designates 
the planet Jupiter, is certainly not supported by good evidence. 
Oldenberg
	2 seems clearly right in rejecting it. 1) Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathe- 
matik. 6. 2) Nachrichten der königlichen Gesellschaft 
der Wessenschaften zu Göttingen, 1909, 568,

बृहस्पतिगुप्तशायस्थि
बृहस्पति-गुप्त शायस्थि
 is mentioned in the Vaṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 as a pupil of Bhavatrāta Śāyasthi. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

बृहस्पतिसव
बृहस्पति-सव
 is the name of a sacrifice by which, according 
to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 the priest who desired to become 
a Purohita obtained that office. According to the Āśvalāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra,
	2 it was the sacrifice to be performed by a priest 
after the Vājapeya, while the king performed the Rājasūya. In 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 on the other hand, the Bṛhaspati
sava is identified with the Vājapeya; but such identity is 
clearly not primitive.

बेकनाट
बेकनाट
 occurs only once in the Rigveda,
	1 when Indra is 
said to overcome all the Bekanāṭas and the Paṇis. The natural 
sense, therefore, seems to be ‘usurer,’ the explanation given by 
Yāska.
	2 The word has a foreign appearance, but its provenance 
can hardly be determined: it might just as well be aboriginal 
as Babylonian.
	3 Hillebrandt
	4 thinks Brunnhofer is right in 
identifying Bekanāṭa with Bikanir. 1) viii. 16, 10. 2) Nirūkta, vi. 26. 3) Hopkins, Journal of the American

बेकुरा
बेकुरा
 occurs in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where it may 
mean ‘voice’ or ‘sound,’ the sense assigned to the word in the 
Naighaṇṭuka.
	2 It is, however, possibly, like Bakura, the name 
of a musical instrument. In the Taittirīya
	3 and the Kāṭhaka
	4 
Saṃhitās the words Bekuri and Vekuri occur as epithets of 
Apsarases, or celestial nymphs, meaning, perhaps, ‘melodious’; 
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	5 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	6 the 
variations Bhakuri and Bhākuri are found. 1) i. 3, 1; vi. 7, 6; Jaiminīya Brāh

बैजवाप
बैज-वाप,
 ‘descendant of Bījavāpa,’ is the name of a 
teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the 
Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 
20; iv. 5, 26).

बैजवापायन
बैज-वापायन,
 ‘descendant of Baijavāpa,’ is the name of 
a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the 
Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 
20; iv. 5, 26). The name is also spelt Vaijavāpāyana.

बैजवापि
बैज-वापि,
 ‘descendant of Bījavāpa, or Bījavāpin,’ is the 
name of a teacher in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (i. 4, 7).

बैन्द
बैन्द
 is the name of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 According to the 
commentator Mahīdhara, the word denotes a Niṣāda, but 
according to Sāyaṇa a catcher of fish. See Mṛgayu. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1.

बोध
बोध
 is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Mantra Pāṭha.
	1 He is 
mentioned with Pratibodha in the Atharvaveda,
	2 but Whitney
	3 
thinks that in the second passage, at least, the word is an 
ordinary noun meaning ‘the wakeful one.’ 1) ii. 16, 14. Cf. Winternitz, Mantra- 
pāṭha, xiv. 2) v. 30, 10; viii. 1, 13. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 474.

बौधायन
बौधायन,
 ‘descendant of Budha or Bodha,’ is the name 
of a teacher who is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra,
	1 and under whose name are current a Śrauta Sūtra 
described
	2 and in part edited by Caland,
	3 and a Dharma Sūtra 
which has been edited
	4 and translated,
	5 while the Gṛhya Sūtra 
is still unedited. 1) iv. 11, etc. 2) Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana,

See his Introduction, xxix et seq., where, 
however, he tends to overestimate con
siderably the age of Baudhāyana.

बौधीपुत्र
बौधी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Bodha,’ is the 
name of a pupil of Śālaṅkāyanīputra in the last Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) of the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāranyaka 
Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 31).

ब्रह्मचर्य
ब्रह्म-चर्य
 denotes the condition of life of the Brahma- 
cārin
	1 or religious student. The technical sense is first found in 
the last Maṇḍala of the Rigveda.
	2 The practice of studentship 
doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom 
as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in 
the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of 
Vedic society 
The Atharvaveda
	3 has in honour of the Brahmacārin a hymn 
which already gives all the characteristic features of religious 
studentship. The youth is initiated (upa-nī) by the teacher
	4 
into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair 
grow long;
	5 he collects fuel,
	6 and begs,
	7 learns, and practises 
penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature. 
The student lives in the house of his teacher (ācārya-kula-vāsin;
	8 
ante-vāsin);
	9 he begs,
	10 looks after the sacrificial fires,
	11 and 
tends the house.
	12 His term of studentship might be long 
extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years,
	13 but much 
longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned.
	14 The 
age at which studentship began varied.
	15 Śvetaketu com
menced at twelve and studied for twelve years.
	16 
It is assumed in the Gṛhya Sūtras that the three Āryan castes 
were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But 
that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain. 
No doubt individuals of the Kṣatriya or Vaiśya caste might go 
through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys 
of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students. 
This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda
	17 to the 
king guarding his country by Brahmacarya — though that is 
susceptible of a different interpretation — and more clearly by 
the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	18 to a rite intended to 
benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied (vidyām 
anūcya), but had not gained renown, and by references in the 
Upaniṣads to kings who like Janaka studied the Vedas and the 
Upaniṣads.
	19 Normally, however, the Kṣatriya studied the art 
of war.
	20 
One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity. But 
reference is in several places
	21 made to the possibility of mis
conduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is 
any very severe penance imposed in early times — later it is 
different — for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required 
a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure 
fertility.
	22 
Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the 
story of Āruṇi shows.

A Mantra in the Āśvalāyana Gṛhya 
Sūtra, i. 22, 1. 2, and elsewhere, sums 
up the duties of the Brahmacārin as 
‘thou art a Brahmacārin: eat water; 
perform thy duty; sleep not in the 
daytime; obedient to thy teacher study 
the Veda (brahmacāry asy; apo ‘śāna; 
karma kuru; divā mā svāpsīr; ācāry- 
āyādhīno vedam adhīṣva).’ One duty 
specially referred to in the Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka, iii. 1, 6; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇ
yaka, vii. 19, and the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad, iv. 5, 5, was the guarding 
of the teacher's cattle when they were 
grazing on their pasture grounds. From 
these grounds, too, the pupil would, 
no doubt, bring dried dung for fuel, as 
well as any available sticks. As regards 
obedience to the teacher, cf. Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 6. 13) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 10; 
vi. 1, 2. 14) Ibid., viii. 7, 3 (thirty-two years); 
15 (for life), etc. 15) See Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 21. 
The Sūtras allowed for a Brāhmaṇa the 
ages 8-16; for a Kṣatriya, 11-22; for a 
Vaiśya, 12-24. The difference between 
the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, com
pared with that between the Kṣatriya 
and the Vaiśya, shows that the two 
latter castes were in a different position 
from the Brāhmaṇa. 16) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 1, 2. 17) xv. 5, 17. Cf. Lanman in Whit

ब्रह्मज्य
ब्रह्म-ज्य,
 
	1 ‘oppressor of a Brahmin,’ and Brahma-jyeya,
	2 
‘oppression of a Brahmin,’ are terms mentioned several times 
in the Atharvaveda as expressing a heinous crime which 
involves its perpetrator in ruin. See Brāhmaṇa. 1) v. 19, 7. 12; xii. 5, 15 et seq.; xiii. 3, 1. Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 9, 2. 2) Av. xii. 4, 11.

ब्रह्मदत्तचैकितानेय
ब्रह्म-दत्त चैकितानेय
 (‘descendant of Cekitāna’) is the 
name of a teacher in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (i. 3, 26). 
He is mentioned also in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad (i. 38, 1; 
59, 1) as patronized by Abhipratārin, the Kuru king.

ब्रह्मन्
1. Brahman (neut.) denotes the priestly class as opposed to 
the warrior class and the people (Kṣatra and Viś). The term 
is found in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and repeatedly later on.
	2 For the 
position, etc., of this class, see Brāhmaṇa. 1) ii. 15, 4; ix. 7, 9; xii. 5, 8; xv. 10,

Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, vi. 3; vii. 21, etc. 
See also Varṇa and Kṣatra.

ब्रह्मन्
2. Brahman is found in many passages of the Rigveda and 
later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda
	1 
he is referred to as praising the gods; in others
	2 the sense of 
‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases
	3 the priesthood as a 
profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt
	4 
that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member 
of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to 
the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical 
sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is 
undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir
	5 and Roth
	6 
recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner,
	7 how
ever, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages, 
and insists that the Purohita was normally a Brahman in the 
narrower sense. Oldenberg,
	8 on the other hand, holds with 
greater probability that in most of the passages adduced 
Brahman means simply ‘priest,’ and that the Purohita, who 
was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacri
ficing priests (Ṛtvij), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice, 
more usually the Hotṛ priest, and only later became the 
Brahman. This change he regards as having taken place when 
the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was 
laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice 
as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice.
	9 
In the later literature both senses of the word are quite 
common.

This seems rather doubtful; more probably the sense should be 
‘having a Brahman priest as Purohita,’ unless the word merely 
means ‘having the priesthood superior to it,’ as an epithet of 
Kṣatra, the ‘warrior caste,’ which seems to be Weber's view.

ब्राह्मण
1. Brāhmaṇa, ‘descendant of a Brahman’ (i.e., of a priest), is 
found only a few times in the Rigveda,
	1 and mostly in its latest 
parts. In the Atharvaveda
	2 and later
	3 it is a very common 
word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division 
of the castes in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) of the 
Rigveda.
	4 
It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Brāhmaṇa, or 
Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior 
and agricultural castes.
	5 The texts regularly claim for them a 
superiority to the Kṣatriya caste,
	6 and the Brahmin is able by 
his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and 
the warriors
	7 or the different sections of the warriors.
	8 If it 
is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the 
Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the Rājasūya,
	9 
nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so 
as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it 
is expressly recognized that the union of the Kṣatriya and 
the Brāhmaṇa is essential for complete prosperity.
	10 It is 
admitted
	11 that the king or the nobles might at times oppress 
the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain 
swiftly to follow. 
The Brahmins are gods on earth,
	12 like the gods in heaven, 
but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda.
	13 
In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	14 the Brahmin is said to be the 
‘recipient of gifts’ (ādāyī) and the ‘drinker of the offering’ 
(āpāyī). The other two epithets applied, āvasāyī and yathā- 
kāma-prayāpya, are more obscure; the former denotes either 
‘dwelling everywhere’
	15 or ‘seeking food’;
	16 the latter is usually 
taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the 
power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin. 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	17 the prerogatives of the Brah
min are summed up as (1) Arcā, ‘honour’; (2) Dāna, ‘gifts’; 
(3) Ajyeyatā, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyatā, 
‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties 
are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’; 
(6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and 
(7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching). 
1. Respect paid to Brahmins. — The texts are full
	18 of references 
to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled 
bhagavant,
	19 and is provided with good food
	20 and entertain
ment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him 
from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood 
according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	21 
2. Gifts to Brahmins. — The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a 
recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets 
for Dakṣiṇās, or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts
	22 
themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting (Nārā- 
śaṃsī) was often false to please the donors. It was, however, 
a rule
	23 that Brahmins should not accept what had been 
refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of 
cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to 
receive gifts that the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	24 has to explain 
how Taranta and Purumīḷha became able to accept gifts by 
composing a Rigvedic hymn.
	25 The exaggerations in the 
celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious 
result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest (Daśan). 
In some passages
	26 certain gifts — those of a horse or sheep — are 
forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed. 
3. Immunities of Brahmins. — The Brahmin claimed to be 
exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When 
a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift 
does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	27 The king censures all, but not the 
Brahmin,
	28 nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than 
an ignorant priest.
	29 An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide 
(or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal 
dispute.
	30 
The Brahmin's proper food is the Soma,
	31 not Surā
	32 or 
Parisrut,
	33 and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh.
	34 
On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of 
the sacrifice,
	35 for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume 
food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot 
be a physician,
	36 he helps the physician by being beside him 
while he exercises his art.
	37 His wife
	38 and his cow
	39 are both 
sacred. 
4. Legal Position of Brahmins. — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	40 
lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown) 
for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but 
if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only 
real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the 
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	41 The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks 
above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing 
an embryo (bhrūṇa) in the Yajurveda;
	42 the crime of slaying an 
embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying 
a Brahmin.
	43 The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only 
by the horse sacrifice,
	44 or by a lesser rite in the late Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka.
	45 The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the 
later ceremonial,
	46 and hinted at in the curious legend of 
Śunaḥśepa;
	47 and a Purohita might be punished with death for 
treachery to his master.
	48 
5. Purity of Birth. — The importance of pure descent is seen 
in the stress laid on being a descendant of a Ṛṣi (ārṣeya).
	49 But, 
on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine, 
which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true 
criterion of Ṛṣihood.
	50 In agreement with this is the fact 
that Satyakāma Jābāla was received as a pupil, though his 
parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had 
been connected with several men,
	51 and that in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	52 the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required 
merely the name of the pupil. So Kavaṣa is taunted in the 
Rigveda Brāhmaṇas
	53 as being the son of a female slave (Dāsī), 
and Vatsa cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire 
ordeal.
	54 Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove 
doubts as to origin.
	55 In these circumstances it is doubtful 
whether much value attaches to the Pravara lists in which the 
ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the 
sacrifice by the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu priests.
	56 Still, in 
many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more genera
tions was needed,
	57 and in one ceremony
	58 ten ancestors who 
have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of 
the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual 
variations in schools, like those of the Vasiṣṭhas and the 
Viśvāmitras. 
6. The Conduct of the Brahmin. — The Brahmin was required 
to maintain a fair standard of excellence.
	59 He was to be kind 
to all
	60 and gentle,
	61 offering sacrifice and receiving gifts.
	62 
Especial stress was laid on purity of speech;
	63 thus Viśvan- 
tara's excuse for excluding the Śyāparṇas from his retinue was 
their impure (apūtā) speech.
	64 Theirs was the craving for 
knowledge
	65 and the life of begging.
	66 False Brahmins are 
those who do not fulfil their duties
	67 (cf. Brahmabandhu) . 
But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a 
very light and unimportant character.
	68 
7. Brahminical Studies. — The aim of the priest is to obtain 
pre-eminence in sacred knowledge (brahma-varcasam), as is 
stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature.
	69 Such 
distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king 
has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate 
to the Kṣatriya.
	70 Many ritual acts are specified as leading to 
Brahmavarcasa,
	71 but more stress is laid on the study of the 
sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly 
insisted upon.
	72 
The technical name for study is Svādhyāya: the Satapatha 
Brāhmaṇa is eloquent upon its advantages,
	73 and it is asserted 
that the joy of the learned Śrotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to 
the highest joy possible.
	74 Nāka Maudgalya held that study 
and the teaching of others were the true penance (tapas).
	75 The 
object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ (trayī vidyā), that of the 
Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman,
	76 a student of all three Vedas being 
called tri-śukriya
	77 or tri-śukra,
	78 ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects 
of study are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	79 in the 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,
	80 the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	81 etc. (See 
Itihāsa, Purāṇa; Gāthā, Nārāśaṃsī; Brahmodya; Anuśās- 
ana, Anuvyākhyāna, Anvākhyāna, Kalpa, 2. Brāhmaṇa; 
Vidyā, Kṣatravidyā, Devajanavidyā, Nakṣatravidyā, Bhūta- 
vidyā, Sarpavidyā; Atharvāṅgirasaḥ, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya, 
Rāśi; Sūtra, etc.) 
Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given 
in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	82 and in the Sūtras. If study is 
carried on in the village, it is to be done silently (manasā); if 
outside, aloud (vācā). 
Learning is expected even from persons not normally com
petent as teachers, such as the Carakas, who are recognized in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	83 as possible sources of information. 
Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning 
from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the 
priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in 
their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these 
notices any real and independent study on the part of the 
Kṣatriyas.
	84 Yājñavalkya learnt from Janaka,
	85 Uddālaka 
Āruṇi and two other Brahmins from Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,
	86 
Dṛptabālāki Gārgya from Ajātaśatru,
	87 and five Brahmins 
under the lead of Aruṇa from Aśvapati Kaikeya.
	88 A few 
notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars 
went through the country
	89 and engaged in disputes and 
discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants.
	90 
Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned 
of the Brahmins;
	91 Ajātaśatru was jealous of his renown, and 
imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several 
times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas.
	92 
A special form of disputation was the Brahmodya, for which 
there was a regular place at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
	93 
and at the Daśarātra (‘ten-day festival’).
	94 The reward of 
learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’
	95 
8. The Functions of the Brahmin. — The Brahmin was required 
not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give 
others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a 
sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita. 
As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of 
instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual.
	96 
The texts give examples of this, such as Āruṇi and Śvetaketu,
	97 
or mythically Varuṇa and Bhṛgu.
	98 This fact also appears 
from some of the names in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	99 of the 
Sāmaveda and the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka.
	100 On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the 
Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa show that a father often 
preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The 
relation of pupil and teacher is described under Brahmacarya. 
A teacher might take several pupils,
	101 and he was bound to 
teach them with all his heart and soul.
	102 He was bound to 
reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was 
staying with him for a year (saṃvatsara-vāsin),
	103 an expression 
which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily 
change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning 
kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumer
ated.
	104 The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately 
laid down in the Sūtras,
	105 but not in the earlier texts. 
As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices; 
the simple domestic (gṛhya) rites could normally be performed 
without his help, but not the more important rites (śrauta). 
The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests 
to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see Ṛtvij), but other 
rites could be accomplished with four,
	106 five,
	107 six,
	108 seven,
	109 
or ten
	110 priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins
	111 had a seventeenth 
priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because 
he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one 
rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	112 adds three more to the sixteen, a 
second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual 
places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is 
probably not the early view (see Brahman). 
The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the 
advantages of the sacrificer (yajamāna),
	113 but the priest shared 
in the profit, besides securing the Dakṣiṇās. Disputes between 
sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of 
Viśvantara and the Śyāparṇas,
	114 or Janamejaya and the 
Asitamṛgas;
	115 and the Aiṣāvīras are referred to as undesirable 
priests.
	116 Moreover, Viśvāmitra once held the post of Puro
hita to Sudās, but gave place to Vasiṣṭha. 
The position of Purohita differed considerably from that of 
the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate 
at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices 
of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did, 
obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular 
importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as 
opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on 
the Purohita. 
There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later 
prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahma
cārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an 
ascetic
	117 (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha, 
‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's 
case
	118 shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all 
its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and 
family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen
	119 
applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are 
here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities.
	120 
The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings, 
in the Epic tradition,
	121 of retiring to the forest when active life 
is over. 
From the Greek authorities
	122 it also appears — what is 
certainly the case in the Buddhist literature
	123 — that Brahmins 
practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say 
how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the 
Druids
	124 — in some respects very close — suggests that the 
Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional 
tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy
	125 
and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence, 
for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda
	126 says he is a 
poet, his father a physician (Bhiṣaj), and his mother a grinder 
of corn (Upala-prakṣiṇī). This would seem to show that a 
Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the 
ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take 
the field to assist the king by prayer, as Viśvāmitra,
	127 and 
later on Vasiṣṭha
	128 do, but this does not show that priests 
normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been 
agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept 
cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's 
cattle.
	129 It is therefore needless to suppose that they could 
not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercan
tile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be 
remembered that in all probability there was more purity of 
blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the 
Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic 
sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute. 
It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, repre
sented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas, 
if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary 
degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that 
the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the 
epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this 
character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been 
preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A 
legend in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	130 shows clearly that the 
Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only: 
Kosala and Videha, no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only 
rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious 
Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical 
tribes (see Vrātya) had attained intellectual as well as material 
civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization 
was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of 
Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins — not by arms, but 
by mind — of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond 
the pale. 1) i. 164, 45; vi. 75, 10; vii. 103, 1.

ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन्
ब्राह्मणाच्-छंसिन्
 (‘reciting after the Brāhmaṇa — i.e., 
Brahman’) is the name of a priest in the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 In the 
technical division of the sacrificial priests (Ṛtvij) he is classed 
with the Brahman,
	2 but it is clear that he was really a Hotraka 
or assistant of the Hotṛ.
	3 According to Oldenberg,
	4 he was 
known to the Rigveda as Brahman. This is denied by 
Geldner,
	5 who sees in Brahman merely the ‘superintending 
priest’ or the ‘priest.’ 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vi. 4, 2; 6, 3.

भगिनी
भगिनी,
 ‘sister,’ literally the ‘fortunate one’ in so far as 
she has a brother, occurs in the Nirukta (iii. 6).

भगीरथऐक्ष्वाक
भगी-रथ ऐक्ष्वाक
 (‘descendant of Ikṣvāku’) is the 
name of a king in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iv. 6, 
1. 2). It is important to note that he is regarded as being on 
friendly terms with the Kuru-Pañcālas, which points to the 
Ikṣvākus being allied to that people, and not belonging (as is 
the case in the Buddhist books) to the east of India.

भङ्ग
भङ्ग,
 ‘hemp,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda.
	1 In the 
Rigveda
	2 it is an epithet of Soma, presumably
	3 in the sense of 
‘intoxicating,’ which then came to designate hemp.

āyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 14, but not prob
ably. 2) ix. 61, 13. 3) Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 299. 4) Hence the modern ‘Bang’ or

dried leaves and small stalks of hemp, 
taken either by smoking or by eating 
when mixed up into a sweetmeat.

भजेरथ
भजे-रथ
 is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 
where Ludwig
	2 thinks a place-name is meant. Griffith
	3 is 
doubtful whether the word is the name of a place or a man.

भद्रसेनआजातशत्रव
भद्र-सेन आजातशत्रव
 (‘descendant of Ajātaśatru’) is 
the name of a man, presumably a prince, whom Uddālaka is 
said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 5, 5, 14) to have bewitched.

भयदआसमात्य
भय-द आसमात्य
 (‘descendant of Asamāti’) is the name 
of a king in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Oertel,
	2 
however, seems to take the name as Abhayada, but this is not 
probable, for Bhayada is a name in the Purāṇas. 1) iv. 8, 7. 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 247.

भयमान
भयमान
 is, according to Sāyaṇa, the name of a man in 
one hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 which is ascribed by the Anukra
maṇī (Index) to his authorship. The interpretation is, how
ever, uncertain. 1) i. 100, 17. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 266.

भरत
भरत
 is the name of a people of great importance in the 
Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear 
prominently in the third and seventh Maṇḍalas in connexion 
with Sudās and the Tṛtsus,
	1 while in the sixth Maṇḍala they 
are associated with Divodāsa.
	2 In one passage
	3 the Bharatas 
are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the Pūrus: there can be little 
doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and 
and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg
	5 
considers that the Tṛtsus are the Vasiṣṭhas, the family singers 
of the Bharatas; while Geldner
	6 recognizes, with perhaps more 
probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas. 
That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer
	7 
holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the 
Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view
	8 occupied the country to the east of 
the Paruṣṇī (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be 
regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas 
the Rigveda
	9 recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the Sarasvatī, 
Āpayā, and Dṛṣadvatī — that is, in the holy land of India, the 
Madhyadeśa. Hillebrandt
	10 sees in the connexion of the 
Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not 
supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion 
some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in 
connexion with the Bharadvāja family, while Sudās, his son, 
^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172 
et seq. 
or perhaps grandson (cf. Pijavana), is connected with the 
Vasiṣṭhas and the Viśvāmitras. 
In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially 
famous. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	11 mentions Bharata Dauḥ
ṣanti as a king, sacrificer of the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 
and Śatānīka Sātrājita, as another Bharata who offered that 
sacrifice. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	12 mentions Bharata Dauḥ
ṣanti as receiving the kingly coronation from Dīrghatamas 
Māmateya, and Śatānīka as being consecrated by Somaśuṣman 
Vājaratnāyana, a priest whose name is of quite late origin. 
The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly 
shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the 
Kāśis, and make offerings on the Yamunā (Jumna) and Gaṅgā 
(Ganges).
	13 Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclama
tion for the people, the variants recorded
	14 include Kuravaḥ, 
Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ, and Bharatāḥ; and the Mahābhārata 
consistently recognizes the royal family of the Kurus as a 
Bharata family.
	15 It is therefore extremely probable that 
Oldenberg
	16 is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times 
of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-Pañcāla people. 
The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	17 the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	18 the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	19 and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	20 Already 
in the Rigveda
	21 there is mention made of Agni Bhārata (‘of 
the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns
	22 occurs a goddess 
Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the 
Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvatī reflects 
the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvatī in the 
Rigveda.
	9 Again, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	23 Agni is 
referred to as brāhmaṇa Bhārata, ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and 
is invited to dispose of the offering Manuṣvat Bharatavat, ‘like 
Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’
	24 
In one or two passages
	25 Sudās or Divodāsa and, on the 
other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly 
relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg
	26 suggests, to the 
union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus. 
A Bharata is referred to in the fifth Maṇḍala of the Rig
veda:
	27 who he was is uncertain. 1) iii. 53, 9. 12, 24; 33, 11, 12 (Viśvā 
mitra, who is accordingly hailed as 
Bharata-ṛṣabha, ‘bull of the Bharatas,’ 
in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 17, 7); 
vii. 8, 4; 33, 6, in which passage a 
defeat of the Bharatas, and their rescue 
by the aid of Vasiṣṭha, is clearly referred 
to; not, as was formerly thought (e.g., 
Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 354; Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 127), a defeat of the 
Bharatas by the Tṛtsus. 2) vi. 16, 4. 5. Cf. verse 19. 3) vii. 8, 4. 5) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 207. In 
Buddha, 405 et seq., he accepted the 
identification of Ludwig. 6) Vedische Studien, 2, 136 et seq. 7) Altindisches Leben, 127. This is also 
Bloomfield's view (see Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42). 8) Op. cit., 124. 9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 Devasravas 
and Devavāta are mentioned as 
Bhāratas, Oldenberg, Buddha, 410, n., 
mentions that in the Mahābhārata, 
iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvatī 
is called Kauśikī, and the Kuśikas are, 
of course, the family of Viśvāmitra, 
whose connexion with the Bharatas is 
beyond question. 10) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 111. His 
view is that Sudās and the Bharatas 
were later comers than the Tṛtsus, who 
joined them as one people, the Vasiṣṭhas 
becoming the priests of the Bharatas. 
He suggests that the Vasiṣṭhas were 
not originally adherents of the Indra
Soma cult, but were specially devoted 
to the Varuṇa cult; but there is 
no decisive evidence for either sug
gestion. Cf. Bloomfield, as cited in 
n. 7. 11) xiii. 5, 4. 12) viii. 23 and 21. 13) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 
11. 21. 14) In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 
10, 2, and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 7, 4, 2, the phrase is eṣa vo, Bharatā, 
rājā; the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, in the 
Kāṇva recension, xi. 3, 3; 6, 3, has Kura- 
vaḥ, Pañcālāḥ (evidently as a joint people); 
Āpastamba, xviii. 12, 7, gives Bharatāḥ, 
Kuravaḥ, Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ, and 
janatāḥ, as alternatives, according to 
the people to whom the king belongs; 
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 7, and the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 7, read esa te 
janate rājā. See Weber, Indian Litera- 
ture, 114, n.; von Schroeder, Indiens 
Literatur und Cultur, 465. 15) Oldenberg, Buddha, 409. 16) Op. cit., 408. He points out 
(409, n.) that in the Satapatha Brāh
maṇa, xiii. 5, 4, only the Kuru king. 
Janamejaya, and the Bharata kings 
are mentioned without specification of 
the peoples over whom they ruled. 17) xiv. 3, 13; xv. 5, 24, and perhaps 
xviii. 10, 8, on which see Weber, 
Indische Studien, 10, 28, n. 2; below, p. 98. 18) ii. 25; iii. 18. The sense ‘mer
cenary soldier,’ here seen by the St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2 (no longer 
mentioned in the Dictionary of Böht
lingk), cannot be accepted. See Weber, 
Indische Studien, 9, 254; Oldenberg, 
Buddha, 407, n. On the other hand, 
there is no mention of the Bharatas in 
the geographical lists of the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa (viii. 14). in the Mānava 
Dharma Śāstra, or in the Buddhist 
texts. This means that the Bharatas 
were no longer a people, but a family 
or sub-tribe in a larger people. 19) v. 4, 4, 1. 20) i. 27, 2. 21) ii. 7, 1. 5; iv. 25, 4; vi. 16, 19; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 9, 1; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 2, 2. Roth thinks 
this epithet of Agni perhaps means 
‘warlike,’ but this is unlikely. 22) Rv. i. 22, 10; 142, 9; 188, 8; 
ii. 1, 11; 3, 8; iii. 4, 8, etc. 9) iii. 23, 4: in verse 2 Devasravas 
and Devavāta are mentioned as 
Bhāratas, Oldenberg, Buddha, 410, n., 
mentions that in the Mahābhārata, 
iii. 6065, a tributary of the Sarasvatī 
is called Kauśikī, and the Kuśikas are, 
of course, the family of Viśvāmitra, 
whose connexion with the Bharatas is 
beyond question. 23) i. 4, 2, 2. 24) i. 5, 1, 7. 25) i. 112, 14; vii. 19, 8. 26) Op. cit., 410. 27) v. 54, 14.

भरद्वाज
भरद्-वाज
 is the name of the reputed
	1 author of the sixth 
Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. The attribution is so far correct that 
Bharadvāja
	2 and the Bharadvājas
	3 are repeatedly mentioned as 
singers in that Maṇḍala. Judging by the tone of the references 
to Bharadvāja, he can hardly be deemed to have been a con
temporary of any of the hymns.
	4 According to the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa,
	5 he was the Purohita of Divodāsa. This interpreta
tion is to be preferred to that of Roth,
	6 who suggests that he 
and Divodāsa were identical. His connexion with the house of 
Divodāsa also appears from the statement of the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā
	7 that Bharadvāja gave Pratardana the kingdom. It 
is unnecessary to suppose that the same Bharadvāja was meant 
in both cases, and that Pratardana was a son of Divodāsa: the 
later Saṃhitās refer to Bharadvāja, like the other great sages, 
irrespective of chronology. 
The Bharadvājas in their poems mention Bṛbu, Bṛsaya, and 
the Pārāvatas.
	8 Hillebrandt
	9 has pointed out that they are also 
connected with the Sṛñjayas. In particular, the Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra
	10 mentions that Bharadvāja gained largesse from 
Prastoka Sārñjaya and Bṛbu. But it is very doubtful if it is 
correct to place all these people and Divodāsa in Arachosia 
and Drangiana. 
Bharadvāja as an author and a seer is frequently referred to 
in the later Saṃhitās
	11 and the Brāhmaṇas.

	2 ‘husband’ is certainly the most 
natural sense, but, as Delbrück

‘father’ may be meant, since ‘mother’ is here and there

in the battle of the ten kings (Dāśarājña), not opposed to 
them, as Roth,

view. 1) vii. 18, 7. 2) Hopkins, Journal of the American

भावयव्य
भावयव्य
 See Bhāvya.

भाव्य
भाव्य
 is the name of a patron, as it seems, in the Rigveda.
	1 
In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 the form given is Bhāva
yavya, being a patronymic of Svanaya, who is the patron of 
Kakṣīvant. This combination is borne out by the Rigveda, 
where Kakṣīvant and Svanaya are mentioned in the same 
verse,
	3 while Svanaya must be meant in the verse of the same 
hymn,
	4 where Bhāvya is mentioned as ‘living on the Sindhu’ 
(Indus). Roth's
	5 view that Bhāvya here is perhaps a gerundive 
meaning to be ‘reverenced’ is not probable. Ludwig
	6 thinks 
Svanaya was connected with the Nahuṣas. 1) i. 126, 1; Nirukta, ix. 10. 2) xvi. 11, 5. Cf. Bṛhaddevatā, iii. 140. 3) i. 126, 3. 4) i. 126, 1. 5) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

भाषा
भाषा
 in the Nirukta
	1 and Pāṇini
	2 denotes the ordinary 
speech of the day as opposed to Vedic language. Cf. Vāc. 1) i. 4, 5. Cf. ii. 2. 2) iii. 2, 108; vi. 1, 181. Cf. Franke, 
Bezzenberger's Beiträge, 17, 54 et seq., 
who distinguishes the Bhāṣā as the 
speech of conversational use from the 
language regulated by Pāṇini's rules.

भास
भास
 is the name of a bird of prey in the Adbhuta Brāh
maṇa,
	1 and often in the Epic. 1) vi. 8, See Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 40.

भिक्षा
भिक्षा,
 ‘begging,’ is one of the duties of the Brahmacārin 
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The word has also 
the sense of ‘alms,’ as that which is obtained by begging, in 
the Atharvaveda.
	2 According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary,
	3 
it has this sense in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	4 also, but the 
correct reading there is probably Āmikṣā. 1) xi. 3, 3, 7. Cf. a Mantra in 
Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 9, etc.; 
and bhikṣācarya, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upani
ṣad, iii. 4, 1; iv. 4, 26. 2) xi. 5, 9. 3) s.v. 2. 4) viii. 8, 5, where the scholiast ex
plains the word by ‘perfumes, garlands, 
food,’ etc. (gandhamālyānnādi).

भिक्षु
भिक्षु,
 ‘beggar,’ is a term not found in Vedic literature. 
The begging of the Brahmacārin is quite a different thing from 
the duties of the Bhikṣu in the later system of the Āśramas 
(religious stages of life), when the Brahmin in the last stage of 
his life, after leaving his home and family, lives on alms alone. 
See 1. Brāhmaṇa.

भित्ति
भित्ति
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes a mat made of 
split reeds. 1) iii. 5, 3, 9. Cf. Sāṅkhāyana Srauta Sūtra, viii. 3, 24.

भिषज्
भिषज्,
 ‘physician,’ is a word of common occurrence in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 There is no trace whatever in the former 
text of the profession being held in disrepute: the Aśvins,
	3 
Varuṇa,
	4 and Rudra
	5 are all called physicians. On the other 
hand, in the Dharma literature
	6 this profession is utterly 
despised. This dislike is found as early as the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās,
	7 where the Aśvins are condemned because of their 
having to do with the practice of medicine (bheṣaja), on the 
ground that it brings them too much among men, an allusion 
to the caste dislike of promiscuous contact. 
The Rigveda
	8 contains a hymn in which a physician cele
brates his plants and their healing powers. Moreover, wonder
ful cures are referred to as performed by the Aśvins: the 
healing of the lame
	9 and of the blind;
	10 the rejuvenation of the 
aged Cyavana
	11 and of Puraṃdhi's husband;
	12 the giving of an 
iron leg (jaṅghā āyasī) to Viśpalā,
	13 a deed only more wonderful 
if we assume that Viśpalā was a mare, as has been suggested by 
Pischel.
	14 It would in all probability be a mistake to assume
	15 
that the Vedic Indians had any surgical skill: they no doubt 
applied simples to wounds,
	16 but both their medicine and their 
surgery must have been most primitive. All that the Atharva
veda shows in regard to medicine is the use of herbs combined 
with spells,
	17 and of water (cf. Jalāṣa), remedies Indo-European 
in character, but not of much scientific value. On the other 
hand, the knowledge of anatomy shown (see Śarīra), though 
betraying grave inaccuracies, is not altogether insignificant; 
but that was due no doubt mainly to the practice of dissecting 
animals at the sacrifice. 
There is some evidence in the Rigveda
	18 that the practice of 
medicine was already a profession; this is supported by the 
inclusion of a physician in the list of victims at the Puruṣa
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	19 According to 
Bloomfield,
	20 a hymn of the Atharvaveda
	21 contains a physician's 
deprecation of the use of home-made remedies instead of 
reliance on his professional training. 1) ii. 33, 4; vi. 50, 7; ix. 112, 1;

भीम वैदर्भ
 (‘prince of Vidarbha’) is mentioned in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 34) as having received instruction 
regarding the substitute for the Soma juice, through a succession 
of teachers, from Parvata and Nārada.

भुज्यु
1. Bhujyu denotes, according to the St. Petersburg Dic
tionary, an ‘adder’ in two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 and one of 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	2 But the sense is uncertain in all 
these passages. 1) iv. 27, 4; x. 95, 8. 2) xviii. 42. 
Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 126, 
who takes bhujyu in Rv. x. 95, 8, as 
meaning ‘ardent,’ ‘rutting.’

भुज्यु
2. Bhujyu is the name of a man, son of Tugra, who is 
repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as saved from the deep 
by the Aśvins. According to Bühler,
	2 the passages refer to 
Bhujyu being saved from shipwreck during a voyage in the 
Indian Ocean, but the evidence is inadequate to support this 
conclusion. Cf. Samudra. 1) i. 112, 6, 20; 116, 3; 117, 14; 
119, 4; vi. 62, 6; vii. 68, 7; 69, 7;

भुज्यु लाह्यायनि
 (‘descendant of Lahyāyana’) is the name 
of a teacher, a contemporary of Yājñavalkya, in the Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad (iii. 3, 1).

भुरिज्
भुरिज्
 (used in the dual only) is a word of somewhat 
doubtful sense. Roth
	1 regarded it as meaning in some 
passages
	2 ‘scissors,’ and in others
	3 an apparatus consisting of 
two arms used by the chariot-maker for fixing the wood at 
which he worked, being of the nature of a carpenter's vice. See 
also Ksura 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. 
Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 466. 2) Rv. viii. 4, 16; Av. xx. 127, 4. 3) Rv. iv. 2, 14; ix. 26, 4; 71, 5. 
where Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 239
243, considers that the shafts of the 
chariot are meant (cf. Gobhila Gṛhya 
Sūtra, iii. 4, 31, whence it appears that 
the chariot-pole, spoken of as having 
two arms, was forked). The same view 
regarding the passages cited in n. 2 
gives the sense of a stropping apparatus, 
consisting of two pieces of wood, be
tween which a grindstone moves. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 252, 
255.

भूतविद्या
भूत-विद्या
 is one of the sciences enumerated in the Chān
dogya Upaniṣad.
	1 It seems to mean the ‘science of creatures’ 
that trouble men, and of the means of warding them off, 
‘demonology.’ 1) vii. 1, 2. 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 115.

भूतवीर
भूत-वीर
 is the name of a family of priests who, according 
to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 were employed by Janamejaya to 
the exclusion of the Kaśyapas. A family of the latter, the 
Asitamṛgas, however, won back the favour of Janamejaya, and 
ousted the Bhūtavīras. 1) vii. 27. Cf. Roth, Zur Litteratur 
und Geschichte des Weda, 118; Eggeling, 
Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, n. 3;

भूतांश
भूतांश
 is in the Rigveda
	1 the name of a poet, a descen
dant of Kaśyapa. 1) x. 106, 11. See Nirukta, xii, 41; Bṛhaddevatā. viii. 18. 19; Ludwig,

भूति
भूति
 is the term used in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 for 
‘prosperity.’ 1) viii. 59, 7. Cf. i. 161, 1 (both late 
passages). 2) Av. ix. 6, 45; x. 3, 17; 6, 9; xi. 7, 
22; 8, 21; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 
1, 1; 3, 5, etc.; bhūti-kāma, ‘desiring 
prosperity,’ Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 
1, 1; 2, 3, 3; v. 1, 9, 1, etc.

भूमि
भूमि
 or Bhūmī is a common word for ‘earth’ in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 being practically a synonym of Pṛthivī. 
It is also used of the land given by the god to the Āryan,
	3 and 
of grants of land.
	4 1) i. 64, 5; 161, 14; ii. 14, 7, etc. 
So in x. 18, 10, ‘mother earth’ receives 
the remains of the dead. 2) Av. vi. 2, 1, where it is said that 
the Bhūmi is the highest of the three 
earths (Pṛthivī); xi. 7, 14, where nine 
earths and seas are mentioned; ii. 9, 4; 
vi. 8, 2, etc. 3) Rv. iv. 26, 2. Cf. vi. 47, 20. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 4, 24;

भूमि-दुन्दुभि,
 ‘earth drum,’ denotes a pit covered with a 
hide used at the Mahāvrata rite, and mentioned in the Saṃ
hitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas.

भूमिपाश
भूमि-पाश,
 ‘earth net,’ is the name of a plant in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, probably some sort of creeper. 
^1 xiii. 8, 1, 16. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 427, n. 1.

भृगवाण
भृगवाण
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 
apparently
	2 as a name of a man who is called Śobha. Ludwig,
	3 
however, thinks that his name was Ghoṣa. Elsewhere the 
word appears as an epithet of Agni, doubtless in allusion to his 
cult by the Bhṛgus. 1) i. 120, 5. 2) Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 4; 2, 92. 3) Über Methode bei Interpretation, 4.

भृगु
भृगु
 is a sage of almost entirely mythical character in the 
Rigveda and later. He counts as a son of Varuṇa,
	1 bearing 
the patronymic Vāruṇi.
	2 In the plural the Bhṛgus are 
repeatedly
	3 alluded to as devoted to the fire cult. They are 
clearly
	4 no more than a group of ancient priests and ancestors 
with an eponymous Bhṛgu
	5 in the Rigveda, except in three 
passages,
	6 where they are evidently regarded as an historic 
family. It is not clear, however, whether they were priests or 
warriors: in the battle of the ten kings the Bhṛgus appear with 
the Druhyus, perhaps as their priests, but this is not certain.
	7 
In the later literature the Bhṛgus are a real family, with sub
divisions like the Aitaśāyana, according to the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa.
	8 The Bhṛgus are mentioned as priests in connexion 
with various rites, such as the Agnisthāpana
	9 and the Daśa
peyakratu.
	10 In many passages they are conjoined with the 
Aṅgirases.
	11 the close association of the two families is shown 
by the fact that Cyavana is called either a Bhārgava or an 
Āṅgirasa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	12 In the Atharvaveda
	13 
the name of Bhṛgu is selected to exemplify the dangers incurred 
by the oppressors of Brahmans: the Sṛñjaya Vaitahavyas 
perish in consequence of an attack on Bhṛgu. In the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	14 also Bhṛgu has this representative character. Cf. 
Bhṛgavāṇa and Bhārgava. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 6, 1, 1; 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, ix. 1. Cf. Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 9, 2; Nirukta, 
iii. 17. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 34, and 
n. 14. For a different form of the legend, 
cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 5. 3) Rv. i. 58, 6; 127, 7; 143, 4; ii. 4, 2; 
iii. 2, 4; iv. 7, 1, etc. See Macdonell, 
Vedic Mythology, 51. The legend of 
their chariot-making (Rv. iv. 16, 20; 
x. 39, 14) may be due, as Roth, St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., suggests, 
to a confusion with the Ṛbhus. It 
may, however, be an allusion to the 
historic Bhṛgus, whom we find in the 
battle of the ten kings. 4) As shown by the legend of fire 
having been brought to them by 
Mātariśvan, Rv. iii. 5, 10. 5) i. 60, 1, where, however, Roth, 
loc. cit., takes the singular in a collective 
sense, an interpretation which may be 
correct, but is not necessary. 6) Rv. vii. 18, 6; viii. 3, 9; 6, 18, to 
which list, given by Macdonell, loc. cit., 
Roth adds viii. 102, 4, Aurva-Bhṛgu-vat, 
‘like Aurva and Bhṛgu.’ Cf. the fact 
that the Aurvas, in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa, vi. 33, take the place of the Bhṛgus 
of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxx. 5. 7) In viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; 102, 4, the 
reference to a priestly family is the 
more natural; in vii. 18, 6, warriors 
may be meant. Cf. Hopkins, Journal 
of the American Oriental Society, 15, 
262, n., where he cites ix. 101, 13, as 
perhaps denoting the same thing. 8) xxx. 5. See n. 6. 9) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 5, 2; 
v. 6, 8, 6; Av. iv. 14, 5; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, i. 4, 1 (p. 48). 10) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 18; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2, 5; Pañcavimśa 
Brāhmaṇa, xviii. 9, 2. 11) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 1, 7, 2;

first and last of which passages the 
Atharvans also occur. See Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxvii. n. 2. 
Hence, in the Atharvanic ritual texts,

भेद
1. Bheda, one of the enemies of Sudās and the Tṛtsu- 
Bharatas, was defeated by the former in the Yamunā (Jumna),
	1 
apparently in a second conflict fought after the battle of the ten 
kings, in which Sudās successfully defended his western frontier 
against the confederate foes. The Ajas, Śigrus, and Yakṣus, 
who are mentioned as also defeated, may have been united 
under his leadership if he was a king; or the Bhedas may have 
been a separate people, as Roth
	2 thinks. Hopkins'
	3 opinion 
that the defeat was on the Paruṣṇī, Yamunā being another 
name of that stream, is most improbable; nor is the view that 
Bheda was one of the ten kings essential.

भेद
2. Bheda is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 as having come 
to a bad end because he refused a cow (vaśā) to Indra when 
asked for it. That he is different from the preceding Bheda, as 
Roth
	2 assumes, is not certain. Indeed, it may very well be 
that his defeat led to his being chosen as the representative of 
the evil end of the wicked man. Moreover, the irreligious 
character of Bheda may be ascribed to his being a leader of 
non-Āryan folk, if the Ajas and Śigrus, with whom in the 
Rigveda he is connected or associated were, as is possible, 
though by no means certain, un-Āryan tribes of totemists.

p. 153, who inclines to see in them 
totemistic tribes, but the names furnish 
the sole support of this conjecture. On 
this supposition they were probably 
non-Āryan. Cf. Aja.

भेषज
1. Bheṣaja, denoting a ‘remedial agent,’ ‘medicine,’ is often 
mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 being also used in a 
figurative sense.
	3 Plants,
	4 waters,
	5 and spells
	6 are repeatedly 
enumerated as medicines. Most of the medical practices of the 
Atharvaveda are merely examples of sympathetic magic. For 
example, in one hymn
	7 the yellow of jaundice is entreated to 
pass into yellow birds. In another
	8 fever is to be banished by 
means of a frog; for the frog, being a potent means of cooling 
fire
	9 (because of its association with water), is regarded as 
analogously effective in banishing the fire of fever. See Bhiṣaj. 1) i. 89, 4; ii. 33, 2, etc. 2) Av. v. 29, 1; vi. 21, 2, etc. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 3, 1, 1;

Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 9, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāh
maṇa, xvi. 7, etc. Possibly there is 
some truth in Zimmer's view, Altin-

to the beneficial effects of bathing. 6) Exemplified in the medical spells 
of the Atharvaveda and the Kauśika

they are regarded as having ‘healing’ powers. 1) xi. 6, 14. 2) Āśvalāyana Srauta Sūtra, x. 7, 3;

भ्रातृ
भ्रातृ
 is the common designation of ‘brother’ from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards. The word is also applied to a relation or 
close friend generally,
	2 but here the persons concerned are, it 
should be noted, in the Rigveda
	3 deities, who are brothers of 
one another or of the worshipper. Thus in the early literature 
the word has not really lost its precise sense. The derivation 
from the root bhṛ, ‘support,’ is probably correct, designating 
the brother as the support of his sister. This harmonizes with 
the fact that in Vedic literature the brother plays the part of 
protector of his sister when bereft of her father, and that 
maidens deprived of their brothers (abhrātṛ) meet an evil fate.
	4 
The gradation of the relations in the home is shown by the 
order in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	5 where father, mother, 
brother, and sister are successively mentioned. Strife between 
brothers is occasionally referred to.

Atharvaveda, 72.

भ्रातृव्य
भ्रातृव्य
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	1 
where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an 
expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's) 
brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’
	2 this meaning alone accounting for the 
sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda,
	3 
and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.
	4 In 
an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily 
develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may, 
however, have been ‘nephew,’
	5 as the simple etymological 
sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account 
for the later meaning so well. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	6 pre
scribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhrātṛvya, who, further, 
is often given the epithets ‘hating’ (dviṣan) and ‘evil’ (apriya, 
pāpman) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.
	7 The Athar
vaveda
	8 also contains various spells, which aim at destroying or 
expelling one's ‘rivals.’ 1) v. 22, 12, and perhaps x. 3, 9. 2) The word is rendered ‘cousin’ by 
Whitney in his Translation of the 
Atharvaveda (x. 6, 1; xv. 1, 8). 3) ii. 18, 1; viii. 10, 18. 33; x. 9, 1. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 5, 9, 2,

13. 5) Whitney, in his Translation of the 
Atharvaveda (ii. 18, 1), while rendering 
the word by ‘adversary,’ explains it in 
a note as meaning literally ‘nephew,’ 
or ‘brother's son.’ 6) xxvii. 8. 7) See several of the passages given 
in n. 4. 8) ii. 18, 1; x. 9, 1, etc. Cf. Tait 
tirīya Saṃhitā, i. 3. 2, 1, etc. 
Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtschaftsnamen, 501, 506, 507, 
who thinks it means a kind of brother, 
and through early family conditions 
was restricted to cousins; Böhtlingk 
and Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v.; Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 307.

भ्रूणहन्
भ्रूण-हन्,
 ‘slaying an embryo’; Bhrūṇa-hatyā, ‘the 
slaying of an embryo,’ are terms expressing a crime which is 
repeatedly and severely censured in the later Saṃhitās,
	1 where 
it is said to be the greatest of all crimes, and one of which the 
guilt cannot be removed. In many later passages
	2 the same 
crime is referred to, always with reprobation: this fact alone 
shows the erroneousness of the theory
	3 that daughters could be 
allowed, once born, to die if their fathers so desired. 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 1, 9;

मकक
मकक,
 a word occurring once in the Atharvaveda (viii. 6, 
12), may be the name of some unknown animal; but it is 
possibly an adjective having some such sense as ‘bleating.’

मकर
मकर
 is the name of an animal, probably the ‘crocodile,’
	1 
which is included in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	2 1) The Makara, as a Hindu sculptural 
ornament, originally represented a 
crocodile. Cf. Cousen's article in the 
Annual Report of the Archaological Survey 
of India for 1903-4, pp. 227-231 (where 
the Makara appears as the vehicle of 
Varuṇa and of Gaṅgā). Cf. also op. cit.,

मक्ष,
 ‘fly,’ is found in the Rigveda

ferred to.

मख
मख
 appears to designate a person in two passages of the 
Rigveda,
	1 but in neither passage does the context explain who 
he was. Probably a demon of some kind is meant. In the 
later Saṃhitās
	2 mention is also made of the ‘head of Makha,’ 
an expression which has become unintelligible to the Brāh
maṇas.
	3 1) ix. 101, 13, where the Bhṛgus are 
mentioned as opposed to Makha (cf.

मगध
मगध
 is the name of a people who appear throughout 
Vedic literature as of little repute. Though the name is not 
actually found in the Rigveda,
	1 it occurs in the Atharvaveda,
	2 
where fever is wished away to the Gandhāṛis and Mūjavants, 
northern peoples, and to the Aṅgas and Magadhas, peoples of 
the east. Again, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,
	3 the Māgadha, or man of 
Magadha, is included as dedicated to ati-kruṣṭa, ‘loud noise’(?), 
while in the Vrātya hymn of the Atharvaveda
	4 the Māgadha is 
said to be connected with the Vrātya as his Mitra, his Mantra, 
his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the 
Śrauta Sūtras
	5 the equipment characteristic of the Vrātya is 
said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the Āryan 
Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in Magadha 
(brahma-bandhu Māgadha-deśīya), but this point does not occur 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	6 On the other hand, respectable 
Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the Kauṣītaki Āraṇyaka
	7 
mentions Madhyama, Prātībodhī-putra, as Magadha-vāsin, 
‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg,
	8 however, seems clearly right 
in regarding this as unusual. 
The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudhāyana and 
other Sūtras,
	9 possibly also in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
	10 It is 
therefore most improbable that Zimmer
	11 can be right in 
thinking that in the Yajurveda
	3 and the Atharvaveda
	4 the 
Māgadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed 
caste produced by a Vaiśya marrying a Kṣatriya woman.
	12 
But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some 
doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously 
tribal names as Māgadha. The fact that the Māgadha is 
often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the 
assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and 
that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more 
western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste, 
inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established 
castes. 
The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since 
the Kīkaṭas were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was 
in all probability due, as Oldenberg
	13 thinks, to the fact that 
the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in 
accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	14 that 
neither Kosala nor Videha were fully Brahminized at an early 
date, much less Magadha. Weber
	15 suggests two other grounds 
that may have influenced the position — the persistence of 
aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter 
consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the 
Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if 
substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion, 
would have some force. The former motive, despite Olden
berg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter
	16 has gone so 
far as to suggest that in Magadha the Āryans met and mingled 
with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there 
is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reason
able to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated, 
the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines. 
Modern ethnology confirms this a priori supposition in so far as 
it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the 
eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not 
decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India. 1) See Kikaṭa. 2) v. 22, 14, where the Paippalāda

interesting to note that, while Vaideha,

as a name of a mixed caste, Kausalya 
is not so degraded (Oldenberg, 399, n.). 15) See Indische Studien, 1, 52, 53;

मगुन्दी
मगुन्दी
 is the name of some pest occurring in a verse of an 
Atharvaveda hymn
	1 employed to exorcise evil influences. By 
that verse the ‘daughters of the Magundī’ are to be expelled 
from the cowstall, the wagon, and the house. It is uncertain 
whether an animal, insect, or demoness is meant.
	2 1) ii. 14, 2. 2) Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 58.

मघ
मघ
 in the Rigveda
	1 denotes ‘bounty,’ and Maghavan
	2 is 
the regular Vedic name for the ‘generous giver’ of bounties to 
priests. It is doubtful whether the Maghavans were more than 
this, or had any special rank as a class in Vedic society. See 
Sabhā. 1) i. 11, 3; 104, 5; iii. 13, 3; 19, 1; 
iv. 17, 8; v. 30, 12; 32, 12, etc.; 
Nirukta, v. 16. Very rarely later, e.g., 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xx. 67. 2) Rv. i. 31, 12; ii. 6, 4; 27, 17; 
v. 39, 4; 42, 8; vi. 27, 8, etc. So 
Magha-tti, ‘giving of gifts,’ Rv. iv. 37,

deya, ‘giving of gifts,’ vii. 67, 9; 
x. 156, 2; Maghavat-tva, ‘liberality,’ 
vi. 27, 3. The word Maghavan is the 
epithet par excellence of Indra in the 
Rv. (iii. 30, 3; iv. 16, 1; 31, 7; 42, 5, 
etc.), and survives in post-Vedic litera
ture as a name of Indra; otherwise, 
even in the later Saṃhitās, it is very 
rare, occurring practically as a divine 
epithet only (of Indra, Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, iv. 4, 8, 1; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upani
ṣad, i. 3, 13; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, 
ii. 11).

मङ्गल
मङ्गल
 is the name of a teacher in the Baudhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra (xxvi. 2).

मङ्गीर
मङ्गीर
 is found in an obscure verse in the Vaitāna
	1 and 
other
	2 Sūtras with reference to cows. It is quite uncertain 
whether a river or a man
	3 is meant. The Gaṅgā (Ganges) and 
the Yamunā (Jumna) are mentioned in the same verse. The 
correct form of the word is doubtful.

मञ्जिष्ठा,
 ‘madder,’ is mentioned in the Aitareya (iii. 2, 4)

मटची
मटची
 occurs in a passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	1 
where reference is made to the Kurus being overwhelmed by 
Maṭacīs.
	2 Śaṅkara interprets the word by ‘thunderbolts’ 
(aśanayaḥ), while Ānandatīrtha in his commentary gives, as an 
alternative rendering, pāṣāṇa-vṛṣṭayaḥ — i.e., ‘hailstones,’ which 
may be the sense. The Śabdakalpadruma,
	3 agreeing with 
Ānandatīrtha,
	4 says that Maṭacī means, ‘a kind of small red 
bird’ (rakta-varṇa-kṣudra-pakṣi-viśeṣa, reading -pakṣī-), and 
Jacob
	5 suggests that the ‘locust’ is meant. 1) i. 10, 1. 2) Maṭacī-hata. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) On Brahmasūtra, iii. 4, 28. 5) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,

मणि
मणि
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 of a ‘jewel’ used 
as an amulet against all kinds of evil. That either ‘pearl’
	3 or 
‘diamond’
	4 is denoted is not clear.
	5 It is evident that the 
Maṇi could be strung on a thread (sūtra), which is referred to 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	6 and elsewhere;
	7 the Maṇi was 
certainly also worn round the neck, for in the Rigveda
	8 occurs 
the epithet maṇi-grīva, ‘having a jewel on the neck.’ An 
amulet of Bilva is celebrated in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	9 
and many varieties of amulet are there enumerated.
	10 The 
‘jeweller’ (maṇi-kāra) is mentioned in the list of victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	11 1) i. 33, 8. 2) Av. i. 29, 1; ii. 4, 1, 2; viii. 5,

xxxv. 15; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6; 
Nirukta, vii. 23, where Durga, in his 
commentary, takes Maṇi as āditya-maṇi, 
or ‘sun-stone,’ while the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v., suggests that a crystal 
used as a burning glass may be meant. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 4) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben 
53. 5) The expression hiraṇya maṇi in Rv 
i. 33, 8, might possibly mean ‘gold a 
an ornament,’ but ‘gold (and) jewels 
is more probable. Cf. Av. xii. 1, 44, 
where maṇiṃ hiraṇyam must mean a 
jewel (and) gold.’ 6) xx. 16, 6. 7) Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,

Proceedings of the Berlin Academy, 1891, 
796. Weber is inclined to detect a 
Babylonian origin of Maṇi (cf. Manā), 
but the evidence is not convincing.

मणिक
मणिक
 in the late Adbhuta Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Sūtras
	2 
denotes a large ‘water bottle.’ 1) Weber, Omina und Portenta, 316. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 9, 3;

मण्ड
मण्ड,
 n., is found in the compound nau-maṇḍa (du.), 
denoting the two ‘rudders’ of a ship in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) ii. 3, 3, 15. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 12, 345, n. 3, who, 
following the commentary, accepts 
‘sides’ as the meaning; Caland, Über 
das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 60.

मण्डूक
मण्डूक
 is the name of ‘frog’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 
the feminine Maṇḍūkī also occurring.
	3 The famous frog hymn 
of the Rigveda
	4 compares with Brahmins the frogs croaking 
as they awake to activity at the beginning of the rains. It has 
been explained by Max Müller
	5 as a satire on the Brahmins. 
Geldner,
	6 agreeing with this view, thinks that it is directed by 
its Vasiṣṭha composer against rival Brahmins, probably the 
Viśvāmitras.
	7 The view, however, which interprets the hymn 
as a rain charm
	8 seems on the whole more likely. The frog, 
from its connexion with water, was considered to have cooling 
properties. Thus after the burning of the dead body the frog 
is invited to come to the spot where the cremation has taken 
place in order to cool it down.
	9 Similarly the frog is invoked 
in the Atharvaveda against the fire of fever.

मत्स्य
1. Matsya, ‘fish,’ is mentioned only once in the Rigveda,
	1 
but frequently later.
	2 1) x. 68, 8. 2) Av. xi. 2, 25; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
iii. 9, 5; 14, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxiv. 21, 34; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 
6, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 1, 1 
(the famous fish of the deluge legend); 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, i. 4, 3; Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad, i. 2; mahā-matsya, ‘great 
fish,’ Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 
18. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 
3, 12 (cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
x. 7, 8; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
xvi. 2, 23), a Matsya Sāṃmada is 
personfied as the king of the fishes.

मत्स्य
2. Matsya appears to be the name of a people in one passage 
of the Rigveda,
	1 where they are ranged with the other enemies 
of Sudās, although it is possible to see merely the sense of 
‘fish’ in that passage. In the list of Aśvamedhins, ‘offerers of 
the horse sacrifice,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 Dhvasan 
Dvaitavana is mentioned as a Matsya king (Mātsya). The 
Matsyas as a people occur also in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad
	3 in 
connexion with the Vaśas,
	4 and in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	5 in 
connexion with Śālvas. In Manu
	6 the Kurukṣetra, the 
Matsyas, the Pancālas, and the Śūrasenakas comprise the 
land of the Brahmin Ṛṣis (brahmarṣi-deśa). There is no 
reason to doubt that the Matsyas occupied much the same 
territory as in Epic times, say Alwar, Jaipur, Bharatpur.
	7 1) vii. 18, 6. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 9. 3) iv. 1. 4) This is the most probable reading, 
which results from a comparison with 
Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 9, where 
Śālva-Matsyeṣu is followed by savaśa- 
Uśīnareṣu (misprinted śavaśa-). See 
Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 
1908, 367. The older view was Satvan- 
Matsyeṣu, Max Müller, Sacred Books of 
the East, 1, lxxvii, following Cowell; 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Satvant. 5) i. 2, 9. 6) ii. 19; vii. 193. 7) See Vincent Smith, Zeitschrift der

und Cultur, 166; Weber, Indische Studien,

मदावती
मदा-वती,
 ‘intoxicating,’ is the name of a plant in the 
Atharvaveda.
	1 1) vi. 16, 2; cf. iv. 7, 4. Cf. Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 292; 
Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
465; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72.

मदुघ
मदुघ,
 ‘honey-plant,’
	1 is the name of a sweet herb in the 
Atharvaveda.
	2 The spelling is somewhat uncertain, since 
many manuscripts read Madhugha.
	3 1) The literal meaning is probably 
‘yielding honey,’ the word being, ac
cording to the commentator, derived 
from madhu-dugha, a word actually 
occurring in the Rigveda (vi. 70, 1. 5). 2) i. 34, 4; vi. 102, 3. Cf. Weber, 
Indische Studien, 5, 386, n.; 404; 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 34, 35, 355; Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 275; Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 69. 3) These two forms probably stand 
by haplology for ma[dhu]-dugha and 
madhu-[du]gha. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic 
Grammar, 64, 1a.

मद्गु
मद्गु,
 ‘diver’ (from the root majj,
	1 ‘dive’), is the name of 
some aquatic bird which is included in the list of victims at the 
Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	2 and 
is occasionally mentioned elsewhere.

Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

मद्य
मद्य,
 ‘intoxicating liquor,’ is not mentioned until the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad,
	1 where it occurs in the compound 
madya-pā, ‘drinking intoxicating liquor.’ 1) v. 11, 5. The word is found in the Epic and often in the Dharmaśāstras, as 
well as in medical texts.

मद्र
मद्र
 denotes a people who are mentioned in the Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad;
	1 Kāpya Patañcala was then living among 
them. Their name appears elsewhere in Vedic literature, only 
in that of a branch, the Uttara Madras, the ‘northern Madras,’ 
who are referred to in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	2 as living 
beyond the Himālaya (pareṇa Himavantam) in the neigh
bourhood of the Uttara Kurus, probably, as Zimmer
	3 con
jectures, in the land of Kaśmīr. The Madras mentioned in 
the Upaniṣad were, like the Kurus, probably settled some
where in Kurukṣetra in the Madhyadeśa or ‘Middle Land.’

मद्रगारशौङ्गायनि
मद्र-गार शौङ्गायनि
 (‘descendant of Śuṅga’) is the 
name of a teacher, whose pupil was Kāmboja Aupamanyava in 
the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Zimmer
	2 concludes, with probability, 
that these names point to a connexion of the Kambojas and the 
Madras. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. 2) Altindisches Leben, 102.

मधु
मधु
 denotes anything sweet used as food, and especially 
drink, ‘mead,’
	1 a sense often found in the Rigveda.
	2 More 
precisely it denotes either ‘Soma’
	3 or ‘milk,’
	4 or less often 
‘honey,’
	5 which, however, is the most definite sense in the 
later literature. Taboos against the use of honey are recorded.
	6 1) The word is etymologically identical 
with Greek , ‘intoxicating drink,’ 
and Anglo-Saxon medu, ‘mead.’ 2) Used as an adjective, ‘sweet,’ in 
Rv. i. 90, 6. 8; 187, 2; iii. 1, 8;

derived from an instrument provided with thongs for whipping 
milk, a ‘milk-whip.’ 1) Rv. i. 22, 3; 157, 4, Av. x. 7, 19;

मध्य-देश,
 the ‘Middle Country,’ is, according to the 
Mānava Dharma Śāstra,
	1 the land between the Himālaya in 
the north, the Vindhya in the south, Vinaśana in the west, 
and Prayāga (now Allahabad) in the east — that is, between the 
place where the Sarasvatī disappears in the desert, and the 
point of the confluence of the Yamunā (Jumna) and the Gaṅgā 
(Ganges). The same authority
	2 defines Brahmarṣi-deśa as 
denoting the land of Kurukṣetra, the Matsyas, Pañcālas, and 
Śūrasenakas, and Brahmāvarta
	3 as meaning the particularly 
holy land between the Sarasvatī and the Dṛṣadvatī. The 
Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra
	4 defines Āryāvarta as the land east 
of Vinaśana; west of the Kālaka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather 
Kanakhala, near Hardvār; south of the Himālaya; and north 
of the Pāriyātra or the Pāripātra Mountains; adding that, in 
the opinion of others,
	5 it was confined to the country between 
the Yamunā and the Gaṅgā, while the Bhāllavins
	6 took it as 
the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras 
vatī)
	7 and the region where the sun rises. The Mānava 
Dharma Śāstra,
	8 in accord with the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,
	9 
defines Āryāvarta as the region between the Vindhya and the 
Himālaya, the two ranges which seem to be the boundaries of 
the Āryan world in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad also.
	10 
The term Madhyadeśa is not Vedic, but it is represented in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	11 by the expression madhyamā pratiṣṭhā 
diś, ‘the middle fixed region,’ the inhabitants of which are 
stated to be the Kurus, the Pañcālas, the Vaśas, and the 
Uśīnaras. The latter two peoples practically disappear later 
on, the Madhyadeśa being the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, 
the land where the Brāhmaṇas and the later Saṃhitās were 
produced, bounded on the east by the Kosala-Videhas, and on 
the west by the desert. The western tribes are mentioned with 
disapproval both in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	12 and the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	13 while the tradition of the Brahminization of the 
Kosalas and the Videhas from the Kuru-Pañcāla country is 
preserved in the former Brāhmaṇa.

i. 8. 5) Baudhāyana, i. 2, 10; Vasiṣṭha, 
i. 12. See on Kanakhala, Hultzsch, 
Indian Antiquary, 34, 179. 6) Baudhāyana, i. 2, 11. 12; Vasiṣṭha, 
i. 14. 15, quoting in each case a verse 
of the Nidāna (what work is referred 
to is not certain; there is similar doubt 
as to the quotation in the Nidāna of 
the Bhāllavi Brāhmaṇa, according to 
the Bṛhaddevatā, v. 23, where see 
Macdonell's note, and cf. Bühler, Sacred 
Books of the East, 14, 3, n.). 7) The readings are doubtful, varying 
between sindhur vidhāraṇī or vidharaṇī 
and sindhur vicaraṇī or visavaṇī. The 
latter expression must refer to the 
Sarasvatī; the former may, but not 
necessarily. Conceivably the Sindhu 
(Indus) is meant; for it was a great 
boundary, with Āryan tribes to the east 
of it. 8) ii. 22. 9) i. 9. 10) ii. 13. Cf. Keith, Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka, 28, n. 1. 11) viii. 14, 3. The Uśīnaras may be 
recognized as in the north, for the 
Buddhist texts give Usīragiri as the 
northern boundary of the middle 
country. See Hultzsch, Indian Anti- 
quary, 34, 179. 12) ix. 3, 1, 8. 13) iii. 44, 3; Ludwig, Translation of 
the Rigveda, 3, 245. 14) i. 4, 1. 
Cf. Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, 
14, 2, 3; 146, 147, who points out that 
the Pāripātra Mountains are a part of 
the Vindhya range in Mālvā, and who 
suggests that the western boundary was 
originally the Ādarśa Mountains; for 
the reading of the manuscripts, and 
of the scholiast Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, in the 
Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra, i. 8, is prāg 
ādarśanāt, not adarśanāt (corresponding 
with the Vinaśana of Baudhāyana 
Dharma Sūtra, i. 2, 9), and the Mahā
bhāṣya on Pāṇini, ii. 4, 10, has prāg 
ādarśāt. See also for the Buddhist 
‘Middle Country’ an article by Rhys 
Davids, Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1904, 83 et seq., with Fleet's 
corrections, ibid., 1907, 657; and cf. 
Keith, ibid., 1908, 1143; Max Müller, 
Sacred Books of the East, 32, 58, 59; 
Indian Empire, 1, 303, 304, where the 
extraordinary theory is adopted that 
the Madhyadeśa was peopled by a new 
race of immigrant Āryans, who, travel
ling viā Chitral and Gilgit, and bringing 
no women with them, married Dravidian 
women, and produced the so-called 
Āryo-Dravidians. It is quite impossible 
to find any support for this theory in 
Vedic literature. To say, as is there 
said, that the ‘Vedic hymns contain 
no reference to the route by which the 
Āryans entered India or to their earlier 
settlements on the Indus,’ and that this 
is explained by the theory of the entry 
of the Vedic Indians viā Chitral, is to 
assert absurdities. The theory is based 
on the later dialects and their affinities 
(see Grierson, Indian Empire, 1, 357 
et seq.); it can probably not be regarded 
as at all valid for any period — at any 
rate, it is not cogent for the eighth 
century, B.C.

मध्यन्दिन|मध्यंदिन
मध्यं-दिन,
 ‘mid-day,’ is a frequent designation of time 
in the Rigveda,
	1 the later Saṃhitās,
	2 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	3 
Cf. Ahan. 1) iv. 28, 3; viii. 1, 29; 13, 13; 27, 
19; x. 151, 5, etc. 2) Av. ix. 6, 46; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
vi. 2, 5, 4, etc. 3) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xv. 9, 16;

patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 3, 9; Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad, ii. 9, 6; 14, 1, etc. The 
word is sometimes used as an abbrevia
tion for the ‘midday libation’ (like 
mittag in German for ‘midday meal’) 
in Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 2, 5; 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxix. 8.

मध्यमवह्
मध्यम-वह्
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 as an 
epithet of the chariot. The exact interpretation is doubtful. 
Roth
	2 assigns to it the expression the sense of ‘driving with a 
single horse between the shafts.’ According to Sāyana's 
explanation, it means ‘driving with middling speed.’ It might 
mean ‘driving in the middle’ — that is, ‘only half-way.’^3 1) ii. 29, 4. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 210. 
The context seems to require the sense 
of ‘keeping away’ from the sacrifice. 
Cf. Pūrvavah.

मध्यमशी
मध्यम-शी
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
Roth
	2 assigns to the word the meaning of intercessor, which 
Zimmer
	3 accepts, in the sense of ‘mediator’ or ‘arbiter,’ as a 
legal term, but which Roth may, as Lanman
	4 suggests, have 
intended to express ‘adversary’ or ‘preventer’ of the disease 
referred to in the hymn. Whitney
	5 thinks that it means ‘mid 
most man’ or ‘chief’ as the one round whom his followers 
encamp.
	6 Geldner,
	7 however, thinks that a third king, who is 
‘neutral’ between two enemies, is intended. 1) x. 97, 12 = Av. iv. 9, 4 = Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xii. 86. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Altindisches Leben, 180. Cf. Dharma. 4) In Whitney's Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 159. But see Roth, Sie- 
benzig Lieder, 174, which Lanman may 
have overlooked, since he does not 
refer to it. 5) Loc. cit. 6) Madhyamaśivan, in the Jaiminīya 
Brāhmaṇa, ii. 408, is obscure. 7) Rigveda, Glossar, 131; Kommentar, 
196 (where he seems to decide in favour 
of derivation from śī, not śṛ).

मध्यमस्थ
मध्यम-स्थ,
 
	1 Madhyame-ṣṭha,
	2 in the later Saṃhitās 
denotes the chief in his relation to his followers (sajāta). Cf. 
Madhyamaśī. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxvii. 5. 2) Av. iii. 8, 2, and cf. Madhyama- 
stheya, ‘position of chief,’ Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 5, 1. 
Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 96.

मध्यावर्ष
मध्या-वर्ष,
 the ‘middle of the rains,’ is specially 
mentioned as a time of the year in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	1 
and in the Sūtras.
	2 1) i. 3. 2) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iii. 5, 5. 7, etc.

मनस
मनस,
 occurring in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 seems 
clearly to be the name of a Ṛṣi, in accordance with Sāyaṇa's 
interpretation. 1) v. 44, 10. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 139.

मना
मना
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 in an enumera
tion of gifts, where it is described as ‘golden’ (sacā manā 
hiraṇyayā). It therefore seems to designate some ornament, or 
possibly a weight, and has accordingly been compared
	2 with 
the Greek  (Herodotus has ), the Latin mina. All three 
words have been considered Semitic in origin, as borrowed from 
the Phœnicians
	3 in the case of Greece, from Carthage by way 
of Etruria or Sicily in the case of Rome, and from Babylon in 
the case of India. The identification as regards Manā is very 
conjectural, depending merely on the probabilities of Babylonian 
borrowing
	4 seen — e.g., in the legend of the flood, and in the 
system of the Nakṣatras. On the other hand, Mahā may very 
well be identical with the word manā which occurs several 
times in the Rigveda
	5 in the sense of ‘desire’ (from the root 
man, ‘think’), and which may have in this one passage the 
concrete sense of ‘desirable object.’ It is to be noted that in 
Böhtlingk's Dictionary a single word Manā appears, to which 
the only senses assigned are ‘wish,’ ‘desire,’ ‘jealousy.’ 1) viii. 78, 2. 2) As. e.g., by Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 50, 51; Weber, Indische Studien, 
5, 386; 17, 202, 203; Wackernagel, 
Altindische Grammatik, 1, xxii; Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
16, 278. 3) Or perhaps from Babylon viā 
Asia Minor. The part played by the 
Phœnicians in Greek life is now reduced 
within narrow limits; in the case of 
the mina, probably their commercial 
activities may be considered as likely to 
have caused the adoption of the term. 4) See, e.g., for borrowing, Oldenberg,

Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 
50, 43 et seq.; Bühler, Indian Studies, 3,

India, 160; Macdonell, Vedic Mythology,

(as regards the Ādityas). 5) i. 173, 2; iv. 33, 2, x. 6, 3; Vāja

There are also the derivatives manā-ya, 
‘think of,’ ‘be zealous’: Rv. i. 133, 4; 
ii. 26, 2; manā-ya, ‘desirous’: Rv. 
i. 92, 9; iv. 24, 7; manā-vasu, ‘rich in 
devotion’: Rv. v. 74, 1.

मनावी
मनावी,
 ‘wife of Manu,’ is mentioned in the Kāṭhaka Saṃ
hitā
	1 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 See Manu. 1) xxx. 1 (Indische Studien, 3, 462). 2) i. 1, 4, 16.

मनु
मनु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 has no claim to historical 
reality. He is simply the first man, father of the race, and its 
guide in all matters, sacrificial and other. Hence the views of 
the texts on inheritance are foisted on Manu and his youngest 
son, Nābhānediṣṭha.
	3 He also plays the part of the hero in the 
Vedic legend of the flood.
	4 
Manu is called Vivasvan
	5 or Vaivasvata,
	6 ‘son of Vivasvant’ 
(the god); Sāvarṇi,
	6 ‘descendant of Savarṇā’ (the substitute of 
Saraṇyū in the legend of her wedding); and Sāṃvaraṇi,
	7 
‘descendant of Saṃvaraṇa.’ The first name is, of course, 
mythical. The other two have been regarded as historical, 
Sāvarṇi being taken by Ludwig
	8 as a king of the Turvaśas, but 
this is very doubtful. 1) i. 80, 16; ii. 33. 13; viii. 63. 1;

 is the name, in the Śatapatha Brāh

the verse parts of the Saṃhitās, but also the prose formulæ 
that betray by their style their special and archaic character.

मन्था
मन्था
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 seems to mean a 
‘churn.’ So the root math denotes to ‘churn’ in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā.

मन्थावल
मन्थावल
 is the name of an animal in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa,
	1 a sort of snake according to the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary. Sāyaṇa
	2 understands it to be a kind of animal 
which hangs head downwards from the branches of trees, 
meaning, presumably, the flying fox.

	1 and later
	2 denotes Soma juice 
mixed with meal (Saktu) by stirring. 1) iii. 32, 2; ix. 46, 4. Tilak's con

मन्दीर
मन्दीर
 is perhaps the name of a man whose cattle, according 
to a Mantra in the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xiii. 3, 21), did 
not drink the water of the Gaṅgā (Ganges). See Maṅgīra.

मन्धातृ
1. Mandhātṛ occurs in several passages of the Rigveda,
	1 in 
all of which Roth
	2 takes the word as merely an adjective used 
substantively, ‘the pious man.’ In one passage
	3 the word, 
being applied to Agni, is thus used, but in another
	4 Mandhātṛvat 
being parallel with Aṅgirasvat, ‘like Aṅgiras,’ is naturally to be 
understood as a proper name, which is probably also the sense 
of the word in the preceding hymn.
	5 A different Mandhātṛ
	6 
may be meant in the first Maṇḍala,
	6 where he is mentioned as 
a protégé of the Aśvins, and evidently as a king. To equate 
these persons, and make a Rājarṣi out of Mandhātṛ, as Ludwig
	7 
and Griffith
	8 do, is unnecessary and improbable. 1) i. 112, 13; viii. 39, 8; 40, 12;

where he attributes Rv. viii. 39-42 to 
him as a Nābhāka, ‘descendant of 
Nabhāka.’ 8) Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 147.

मन्धातृयौवनाश्व
2. Mandhātṛ Yauvanāśva (‘descendant of Yuvanāśva’) is 
in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 the name of an emperor who was 
instructed by Vicārin, son of Kabandha Ātharvaṇa. 1) i. 2, 10 et seq. Cf. Bloomfield, Atharvaveda, 111.

मन्या
मन्या
 (plur.), ‘nape of the neck,’ occurs in a passage of the 
Atharvaveda
	1 directed against a disease which Bloomfield
	2 
regards as scrofulous swellings on the neck. He compares the 
disease Manskunder, ‘tumours of the neck’ (which looks like 
a combination of the words manyā and skandhyā, ‘pains of the 
neck and shoulders,’ both occurring in verses 1 and 3 of the 
Atharvan hymn), mentioned by Wise.

ममता
ममता
 is, according to Sāyaṇa, in one passage of the 
Rigveda,
	1 the wife of Ucathya and the mother of Dīrghatamas. 
But the word may be merely an abstract noun meaning ‘self
interest,’ a sense which it often has in the later language. 
Oldenberg
	2 finds a mention of Mamata (masc.) in a verse of 
the Rigveda
	3 as the name of a Bharadvāja. 1) vi. 10, 2. Cf. Mahābhārata, i. 4179 
et seq. 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
lāndischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212. 3) vi. 50, 15, where the reading of the 
received text is mama tasya.

मय
मय
 is found once in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xxii. 19) in 
the sense of ‘horse.’

मयु
मयु
 occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse 
sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 The commentator on 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 explains the word as meaning either 
an ‘ape’ (kiṃpuruṣa) or a ‘forest peacock’ (āraṇya-mayūra). 
The former sense is supported by another passage of the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	2 where the Mayu, being a substitute for 
the man, must be an ape. This sense also suits the word in 
the other passage
	3 where it occurs. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; Vājasanevi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1: Vājasanevi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. 2) viii. 47; mayu āraṇya in Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 10, 1. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 5, 2, 22. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 246.

मयूख
मयूख
 denotes, from the Rigveda onwards,
	1 a ‘peg,’ 
especially as used for keeping a web stretched.
	2 Cf. Otu. 1) Rv. vii. 99, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
ii. 3, 1, 5; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 6; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 15, 9. etc. 2) Rv. x. 130, 2 (in a metaphor); 
Av. x. 7, 42; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 6; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 5, 5, 3, etc.

मयूर
मयूर,
 ‘peacock,’ occurs in the Rigveda in the compounds 
describing Indra's horses, mayūra-roman,
	1 ‘with hair like pea
cocks’ feathers,’ and mayūra-śepya,
	2 ‘with tails like those of 
peacocks.’ The peacock also appears in the list of victims at 
the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	3 
The pea-hen, Mayūrī, is mentioned in the Rigveda
	4 and the 
Atharvaveda,
	5 in both cases with reference to the bird's 
efficacy against poison, a curious superstition to be compared 
with the modern dislike of peacocks' feathers. 1) Rv. iii. 45, 1. 2) Rv. viii. 1, 25. 3) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 4; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23. 27. 4) i. 191, 14 (a late hymn). 5) vii. 56, 7. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 90.

मरीचि
मरीचि
 in the plural denotes according to Weber,
	1 the 
‘particles of light’ or ‘shining motes’ that fill the air, as 
opposed to rays of light (raśmi). This meaning adequately
suits the passages in the early Vedic literature
	2 where the 
word occurs; but the sense of ‘ray’ is quite clearly found in 
the Upaniṣads,
	3 as well as the older sense.
	4 1) Indische Studien, 9, 9, accepted by 
the St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) Rv. x. 57, 12; 177, 1; Av. iv. 38, 5 
(where raśmi and marīci are opposed); 
v. 27, 10; vi. 113, 2; Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, vi. 4, 5, 5 (marīci-pa, ‘drinking 
atoms of light,’ said of the gods); 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 9, 2 (where 
Sāyaṇa's version, sarvatra-prasṛta- 
prabhā-dravya, refers to the light as 
everywhere diffused), etc. 3) Praśna Upaniṣad, iv. 2. Cf. Taittirīya Upaniṣad, i. 1, 2; 2, 1; Maitrāyaṇī 
Upaniṣad, vi. 31. 4) Aitareya Upaniṣad, i. 2.

मरु
मरु,
 in the plural, is mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,
	1 
as the utkara (‘mound of earth thrown up’ from the excavation 
of the altar
	2 ) of Kurukṣetra. This seems to mean that the 
Maru deserts (the later Maru-sthala)
	3 were so called because 
they stood to the ‘altar,’ Kurukṣetra, in the same relation as 
the waste earth of the utkara to the altar at the sacrifice. 1) v. 1, 1. 2) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 
xii. 25, 54. 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 48, 
and Dhanvan. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78.

मरुत्तआविक्षित
मरुत्त आवि-क्षित
 (‘descendant of Avikṣit’) Kāma-pri 
(‘descendant of Kāmapra’) is the name of a king who was 
anointed by Saṃvarta according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 account of the same king he is 
called Āyogava. 1) viii. 21, 12. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 6. Cf. also Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 9, 14. 16; Maitrāyaṇī 
Upaniṣad, i. 4.

मरुद्वृधा
मरुद्-वृधा
 
	1 is the name of a stream mentioned in the 
Nadīstuti (‘Praise of Rivers’) in the Rigveda
	2 along with the 
Asiknī (Akesines) and the Vitastā (Hydaspes). Roth
	3 con
siders that the Marudvṛdhā denotes the stream formed by the 
combined waters of these two rivers down to its junction with 
the Paruṣṇī (Ravi), a view accepted by Zimmer.
	4 On the 
other hand, Ludwig
	5 thinks that the Marudvṛdhā designates 
the stream formed by the junction of the Paruṣṇī with the 
combined waters of the Asiknī and Vitastā, a view which 
seems less likely. 1) Literally, ‘rejoicing in the Maruts’ 
-i.e., ‘swollen by the rainy winds.’ 
The misspelling of the name as Marud
vṛddhā in Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 
pp. 80, 88, is corrected in the Index 
and the Addenda of that work. On 
the accentuation of the name, see 
Vārttika 2 on Pāṇini, vi. 2, 106. 2) x. 75, 5. 3) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des 
Weda, 138 et seq. 4) Altindisches Leben, 11, 12. 5) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
200.

मर्क
1. Marka is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
Roth
	2 sees in the expression sūro markaḥ the ‘eclipse of the 
sun.’ Sāyaṇa
	3 thinks the meaning is ‘purifying.’
	4 1) x. 27, 20. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. He 
thinks, however, that if the word means 
‘eclipse,’ it cannot be derived from the 
root mṛc, ‘injure.’ 3) As from the root mṛj, derivation 
from which is not phonetically justified. 4) Ludwig cites this passage, in his 
essay on eclipses in the Rigveda (Pro
ceedings of the Bohemian Academy, 
1885), as a proof that the Vedic Ṛṣis 
knew of the moon as eclipsing the sun; 
but see Whitney's reply, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 13, lxi et seq., 
and Sūrya.

मर्क
2. Marka is mentioned in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 and else
where
	2 as the Purohita, along with Śaṇḍa, of the Asuras, 
while Bṛhaspati is, of course, the Purohita of the gods. Marka 
is mentioned elsewhere also.
	3 The name may quite possibly 
have Iranian affinities, as believed by Hillebrandt
	4 and by 
Hopkins.
	5 Hillebrandt
	6 also sees in a Gṛdhra mentioned in 
the Rigveda
	7 and elsewhere
	8 a prototype of Marka. 1) vi. 4, 10, 1. 2) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 3; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 5; Śata

26, 279 et seq.

मर्कट
मर्कट,
 ‘ape,’ is enumerated in the list of victims at the 
Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 It 
is classified in the same Saṃhitās
	2 with man and the elephant 
as ‘taking hold by the hand’ (hastādāna) instead of ‘taking 
hold by the mouth’ (mukhādāna). The animal is mentioned 
several times elsewhere also.
	3 Cf. Puruṣa Hastin, Mayu. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 11, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 11; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 5, 7;

Āraṇyaka, iii. 11, 32, etc. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 85.

मर्य
1. Marya in the Rigveda
	1 denotes a ‘man’ especially re
garded as young and a lover, being constantly mentioned as in 
company with maidens (yuvatī). 1) iii. 31, 7; 33, 10; iv. 20, 5; ix. 96, 20, etc.; marya-śrī, ‘adorred as a lover,’ 
ii. 10, 5. Cf. Nīrukta, iii. 15; iv. 2.

मर्य
2. Marya 
	1 in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 denotes a 
‘stallion.’
	2 It is once
	3 described as pastyāvant, ‘a stalled 
horse’ — that is, one carefully tended, and not allowed out to 
graze. 1) vii. 56, 16; viii. 43, 25. 1) vii. 56, 16; viii. 43, 25. 2) This is, of course, only a specialized 
sense of 1. Marya as meaning a ‘male’ 
(cf. Lat. mas, maritus). The specialized 
meaning is somewhat analogous to the 
use of ‘sire’ in English. 3) Rv. ix. 97, 18. Roth, St. Peters
burg Dictionary, s.v. 2, thinks Rv. i. 91, 
13, may have the same sense.

मर्यक
मर्यक,
 occurring only once in the Rigveda,
	1 seems to 
denote the bull which is described as separated from the cows. 1) v. 2. 5. Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 313.

मर्यादा
मर्यादा,
 ‘boundary,’ is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 
referring to the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas. 
Usually the word is metaphorically employed.
	2 1) i. 4, 1, 17. Cf. xiii. 8, 4, 12. 2) Rv. iv. 5, 13; x. 5, 6; Av. vi. 81, 2 
(of an amulet). In the Atharvaveda 
passage Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 392, suggests, owing to 
the very curious use of the word, the 
emendation marya-dā, ‘giver of a son.’

मल
मल
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 is used of the garments 
of the Munis. The St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean 
a ‘leathern garment,’
	2 but Ludwig and Zimmer
	3 think it 
means only ‘soiled’ raiment, which, of course, suits the ordinary 
sense of the word (‘dirt’) in the Atharvaveda,
	4 and the character 
of the long-haired (keśin) hermit (Muni). Cf. Malaga. 1) x. 136, 2. 2) If this were correct, the word might 
be derived from mlā in the sense of 
‘to tan.’ Cf. Carman, especially notes 
6 and 7. 3) Altindisches Leben, 262. 4) vi. 115, 3; vii. 89, 3; x. 5, 24, etc. 
Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 
333, n.

मलग
मल-ग
 in one passage of the Atharvaveda
	1 denotes a cleanser 
of clothes, a ‘washerman,’ but the origin of the word is some
what uncertain.
	2 1) xii. 3, 21. 2) It may, perhaps, have primarily 
meant ‘concerned with dirt.’ See the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. ga 1, on 
the use of ga as forming compounds; 
and cf. Mala. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 262; Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 188.

मलिम्लु
मलिम्लु
 in the Yajurveda Saṃhitā
	1 denotes a ‘robber,’ 
specifically, according to the commentator Mahīdhara, a burglar 
or housebreaker. Cf. Tāyu, Taskara, Stena, and Deva- 
malimluc. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 2, 6; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xi. 78. 79; Av. 
xix. 49, 10.

मलिम्लुच
मलिम्लुच
 is the name of an intercalary month in the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	1 See Māsa. 1) xxxv. 10; xxxviii. 14. Cf. Weber, Jyotiṣa, 100, 102; Naxatra, 2, 350.

मशक
1. Maśaka denotes a ‘biting fly’ or ‘mosquito,’ being de
scribed in the Atharvaveda
	1 as ‘quickly(?) biting’ (tṛpra- 
daṃśin), and as having a poisonous sting. The elephant is 
mentioned
	2 as particularly subject to its stings. The insect 
is often referred to elsewhere.
	3 Cf. Daṃśa. 1) vii. 56, 3. 2) Av. iv. 36, 9. 3) Av. xi. 3, 5; at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’), Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
iii. 14, 8; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 29; 
xxv. 3; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 3, 
24 (Mādhyaṃdina = i. 3, 22 Kāṇva); 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, vi. 9, 3; 10, 2. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 97.

मशकगार्ग्य
2. Maśaka Gārgya (‘descendant of Garga’) is the name of 
a teacher, a pupil of Sthiraka Gārgya, in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 
He is also mentioned in the Sūtras
	2 of the Sāmaveda, and is 
the reputed author of an extant Kalpa Sūtra. 1) Indische Studien, 4, 373, 382. 2) Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 9, 14;

Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 241.

 occurring in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 8, 14, 6), 
is, according to the commentator, the name of a grain of the 
north country.

मस्तु
मस्तु
 in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 
denotes ‘sour curds.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 1, 4;

veda (iv. 15, 1).

महर्षि
मह-र्षि,
 a ‘great Ṛṣi,’ is mentioned in the Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka (i. 9, 6). Cf. Mahābrāhmaṇa.

महाकुल
महा-कुल,
 ‘sprung from a great family,’ is the designation 
of a bowl or cup (Camasa) in the Rigveda (i. 161, 1). The 
metaphorical use of this word shows that the high position of 
certain families was already recognized in the times of the 
Rigveda.

महाकौषीतक
महा-कौषीतक,
 the ‘Great Kauṣītaka (Brāhmaṇa),’ is the 
name of a Vedic text in the Rigveda Gṛhya Sūtras.
	1 1) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 4, 4; 
Mahākauṣītaki, the teacher, in Śāṅkh
āyana Gṛhya Sūtra, iv. 10; vi. 1, etc.

Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 1, 2).

महाधन
महा-धन
 in the Rigveda denotes either a ‘great fight’
	1 
or a ‘great prize’
	2 as the result of a fight. In many cases the 
fight may mean merely the contest of the chariot race. 1) Rv. i. 7, 5; 40, 8; 112, 17; vi. 59, 7, etc. 2) ix. 86, 12.

महानग्नी
महा-नग्नी
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 denotes a ‘courtesan.’ The 
masculine, Mahā-nagna,
	2 ‘paramour,’ is probably secondarily. 
derived from the feminine Mahānagnī.
	3 1) xiv. 1, 36; xx. 136, 5 et seq.; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 27, 1. 2) Av. xx. 136, 11; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, xii. 24, 14. Cf. Whitney, Trans
lation of the Atharvaveda, 747; Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 1, 280, n. 1. 3) As sa-patna, ‘rival,’ is unmistakably 
formed from sa-patnī, ‘co-wife.’

महानाग
महा-नाग,
 a ‘great snake,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa (xi. 2, 7, 12), where it is plainly mythical.

महानिरष्ट
महा-निरष्ट,

Dakṣiṇā, or ‘sacrificial fee,’ in the house of the Sūta at the 
Rājasūya (‘royal consecration’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.

 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 denotes the ‘high road’ 
between two villages. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 17, 8; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 6, 2. Cf. Weber, 
Indische Studien, 1, 271, n.

महापुर
महा-पुर
 in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 
denotes a great fortress.
	1 Probably the only difference between 
the Pur and the Mahāpura was size. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 3, 1; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiv. 10; Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 8, 1. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 23, 2;

consequence. Cf. Maharṣi.

महाभिषेक
महाभिषेक,
 ‘great consecration,’ is mentioned in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and described as a ceremony performed 
for great kings, a list of whom is given. It is equivalent to 
the Rājasūya. 1) viii. 14, 4; 19, 2. Cf. Weber, Episches 
im vedischen Ritual, 8. The list is Janam- 
ejaya Pārikṣita, whose friend was

Cyavana Bhārgava; Satānīka Sātrājita 
and Somaśuṣma Bhārgava; Ambarīṣa 
and Parvata and Nārada; Yudhāṃ-

	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 18, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 22.

महाराज
महा-राज,
 a ‘great king,’ is frequently referred to in the 
Brāhmaṇas.
	1 It seems to mean no more than a king, or rather 
perhaps a reigning and powerful king, as opposed to a mere 
prince, who would also be called Rājan. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 34, 9; 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, v. 5; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 4, 21; ii. 5, 4, 9;

et seq.; Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad, ii. 1,

of the night, after midnight and before dawn. 1) ii. 9; xi. 8. 2) Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, vi. 2, 1; xvii. 7, 1, etc.

महार्णव
महार्णव,
 a ‘great ocean,’ is a phrase not found before 
the late Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad (i. 4), where the drying up of 
‘great oceans’ is one of the marvels enumerated. Cf. Samudra.

महावीर
महा-वीर
 (‘great hero’) is the name in the later Saṃhitās 
and the Brāhmaṇas
	1 of a large earthenware pot which could 
be placed on the fire, and which was especially employed at 
the introductory Soma ceremony called Pravargya. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 14; Sata

महावृक्ष
महा-वृक्ष
 a ‘great tree,’ is mentioned sometimes in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (vii. 6, 15; xiv. 1, 12) and in the 
Sūtras.

महावृष
महा-वृष
 is the name of a tribe mentioned along with the 
Mūjavants in the Atharvaveda
	1 as a locality to which fever is 
to be relegated. It is reasonable to suppose that they were 
northerners, though Bloomfield
	2 suggests that the name may 
be chosen more for its sound and sense (as ‘of mighty strength’ 
to resist the disease) than for its geographical position. In the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	3 the place Raikvaparṇa is said to be in 
the Mahāvṛṣa country. The king of the Mahāvṛṣas in the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	4 is said to be Hṛtsvāśaya. 
The Mahāvṛṣas are also known from a Mantra in the 
Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.

महाशाल
1. Mahā-śāla (lit., ‘having a great house’), a ‘great house
holder,’ is an expression applied in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad 
(v. 11, 1) to the Brahmins who were instructed by Aśvapati, 
no doubt to emphasize their importance. Cf. Mahābrāhmaṇa.

महाशालजाबाल
2. Mahā-śāla Jābāla is the name of a teacher twice men
tioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, once as instructing Dhīra 
Śātaparṇeya,
	1 and once as one of the Brahmins who received 
instruction from Aśvapati.
	2 In the parallel passage of the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad
	3 the name is Prācīnaśāla Aupaman- 
yava.
	4 The word must be considered a proper name rather 
than an adjective (1. Mahāśāla), as it is taken in the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary.

merely as an epithet. Cf. Weber, 
Indian Literature, 161.

the Indus (saindhava) which tears away the peg of its hobble 
(paḍbīśa-śaṅkhu). 1) vi. 2, 13. Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇ

महि-दास ऐतरेय
 (‘descendant of Itara or Itarā’) is the 
name of the sage from whom the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa and 
Āraṇyaka take their names. He is several times referred to in 
the Aitareya Āraṇyaka,
	1 but not as its author. He is credited 
with a life of 116 years in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad

2. Mahiṣī, ‘the powerful one,’ the name of the first of the 
four wives (see Pati) of the king, is mentioned frequently in 
the later literature.
	1 Perhaps even in the Rigveda
	2 the technical 
sense of ‘first wife’ is present. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 1;

महैतरेय
महैतरेय
 is the title of a Vedic text according to the 
Gṛhya Sūtras of the Ṛgveda.

of a teacher, in Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya 
Sūtra, iv. 10; vi. 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka, 39; Oldenberg, Sacred Books 
of the East, 29, 3, 4.

महोक्ष
महोक्ष,
 a ‘great bull,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 1, 2).

मांस
मांस,
 ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something 
quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the 
doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For 
example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods 
will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings.
	1 Again, 
the slaying of a ‘great ox’ (mahokṣa) or a ‘great goat’ (mahāja) 
for a guest was regularly prescribed;
	2 and the name Atithigva 
probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’
	3 The great sage 
Yājñavalkya was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and 
bullocks (dhenv-anaḍuha) if only it was aṃsala (‘firm’ or 
‘tender’).
	4 The slaughter of a hundred bulls (ukṣan) was 
credited to one sacrificer, Agastya.
	5 The marriage ceremony 
was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food.
	6 
That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh 
is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a 
man is performing a vow,
	7 or its use is disapproved, as in 
a passage of the Atharvaveda,
	8 where meat is classed with 
Surā, or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the 
Rigveda
	9 the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the 
Aghās, a deliberate variation for Maghās; but this may be 
the outcome merely of a natural association of death with 
gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question. 
The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this 
world being eaten in the next,
	10 but this is not to be regarded 
as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it 
no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in 
harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which 
becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a deve
loped and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from 
the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its 
fundamentals is later than the Brāhmaṇa period.
	11 
On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the 
road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda,
	12 as is shown 
by the name aghnyā,
	13 ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several 
passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that 
meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical 
considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth 
or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of 
priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes 
than eating was so great as to account adequately for its 
sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to 
Indo-Iranian times.
	14 Moreover, the ritual of the cremation 
of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential 
part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body.
	15 
The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was 
concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims: 
what man ate he presented to the gods — that is, the sheep, the 
goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent 
exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the 
use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being 
the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use 
of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is, 
however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to 
impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to 
the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg
	16 argues. 1) So Agni is called ‘eater of ox and 
cow’ in Rv. viii. 43, 11 = Av. iii. 21, 6 
= Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 3, 14, 7; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 280, 281; 
Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 355. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 1, 2. 
Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, ii. 15, 2. 3) Bloomfield, American Journal of 
Philology, 17, 426; Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 16, cxxiv. Cf. atithinīr 
gāḥ, ‘cows fit for guests,’ Rv. x. 68, 3. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 2, 21. 
The sense of aṃsala is given as sthūla, 
firm,’ in the scholiast. Cf. Kātyāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra, vii. 2, 23-25. Eggeling, 
Sacred Books of the East, 26, 11, has 
tender.’ ‘Off the shoulder’ (aṃsa) is 
also a possible version. 5) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 11, 1; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 14, 5. 6) Q.v. x. 85, 13. Cf. Winternitz, 
Das altindische Hochzeitsrituell, 33. 7) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 1, 8. 
So a Brahmacārin is not to eat flesh. 
See Oldenberg, op. cit., 468, n. 3. The 
blood of an animal is always a some
what mysterious and dangerous sub
stance; hence taboos on meat-eating, 
which in another form arise from fear 
of the spirits of the dead (cf. Oldenberg, 
op. cit., 414, n. 1). See also Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 1, 29; Keith, Journal 
of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1909, 588, n. 4. 8) vi. 70, 1. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 493. 9) x. 85, 13. In the Atharvaveda, 
xiv. 1, 13, the ordinary word Maghās 
is found, and is, no doubt, really to be 
preferred. See Weber, Proceedings of 
the Berlin Academy, 1894, 807. 10) Cf. the story of Bhṛgu Vāruṇi in

is, however, quite possible. Weber, 
op. cit., 17, 281, tries to derive the 
word from ahanya, ‘bright-coloured 
like dya,’ a derivation that must be 
regarded as illegitimate. 14) Cf. Macdonell, Sanskrit Literature,

मातरिश्वन्
मातरिश्वन्
 is mentioned in a Vālakhilya hymn of the 
Rigveda
	1 as a sacrificer along with Medhya and Pṛṣadhra. 
He seems to be mentioned also in one other passage, possibly 
in two.
	2 In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	3 a patron, Pṛṣadhra 
Medhya Mātariśvan or Mātariśva is created by a misunder
standing of the Rigvedic text. 1) Rv. viii. 52, 2. 2) Rv. x. 48, 2; 105, 6. The former 
reference is much more probable than 
the latter. 3) xvi. 11, 26; Weber, Episches im

scripts vary between Mātariśvan and 
Mātariśva.

veda, 3, 163.

मातुर्भ्रात्र
मातुर्-भ्रात्र
 is a curiously formed compound, occurring 
once in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	1 as a designation of the 
‘maternal uncle,’ who in the Sūtra period bears the name of 
Mātula. Thus little is heard of the maternal uncle in the 
Vedic period: it is not till the Epic
	2 that traces appear of his 
prominence as compared with the paternal uncle (pitṛvya). 
This fact is significant for the ‘patriarchal’ character of the 
early Indian family organization.

Oriental Society, 13, 141. 3) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Ver-

मातुल
मातुल,
 
	1 ‘maternal uncle,’ is found only in the Sūtras
	2 and 
later. 1) This peculiarly formed word was 
presumably a dialectic form which 
made its way into the written speech. 2) Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra, i. 24, 4, 
etc.

मातृ
मातृ
 is the regular word for ‘mother’ from the Rigveda 
onwards,
	1 being a formation probably developed under the 
influence of an onomatopœtic word mā,
	2 used like Ambā
	3 
and Nanā.
	4 
The relations of wife and husband, as well as of mother and 
children, are treated under Pati. It remains only to add that 
details are given in the Sūtras
	5 of the respectful attention paid 
to a mother, and of the ceremonies in which she is concerned. 
The mother also appears interested in the fate of her children 
as in the story of the sale of Śunaḥśepa for adoption by 
Viśvāmitra in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	6 
In the household the mother ranked after the father (see 
Pitṛ). Occasionally mātarā is used for ‘parents,’ as are also 
pitarā and mātarā pitarā
	7 and mātā-pitaraḥ.

मातृवध
मातृ-वध,
 ‘matricide,’ is mentioned as a very grave crime 
in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad (iii. 1), but as one that can be 
expiated by the knowledge of the truth.

मातृहन्
मातृ-हन्,

मान
1. Māna as a measure of weight is said to be the equivalent

(Abrus precatorius). It occurs in compounds in the later 
Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.

मान
2. Māna is the name of a man occurring in several passages 
of the Rigveda. In one place
	1 express mention is made of his 
son (sūnu), by whom, despite Bergaigne's view to the contrary,
	2 
Agastya must be meant. In another passage,
	3 apparently the 
same meaning applies to Māna — that is, Agastya as ‘a Māna.’ 
In a third passage
	4 the expression sūnave Mānena has been 
held by Sieg
	5 to be an inversion of Mānasya sūnunā, ‘by the 
son of Māna’ — i.e., Agastya; but it seems more likely
	6 that 
either sūnor Māna is the fuller form of Agastya's name (‘pride 
of the son,’ with reference to his high ancestry), or that the 
son
	7 of Māna (= Agastya) is alluded to as interested in 
Viśpalā. 
The Mānas — that is, the descendants of Māna, are in several 
passages alluded to as singers.

later.

मास
मास
 denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly men
tioned in the Rigveda and later. 
The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were 
those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and 
‘of the full moon,’ Paurṇa-māsī. Two hymns of the Atharva
veda
	1 celebrate these days respectively. A personification of 
the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sinīvālī,
	2 
the day before new moon; Kuhū,
	3 also called Guṅgū,
	4 the 
new moon day; Anumati,
	5 the day before full moon; and 
Rākā,
	6 the day of new moon. The importance of the new and 
full moon days is seen in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals 
of the new and full moon days respectively. 
One special day in the month, the Ekāṣṭakā, or eighth day 
after full moon, was important. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	7 
there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned 
between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of 
new moon. But one Ekāṣṭakā is referred to in the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās and elsewhere
	8 as of quite special importance. This 
was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the 
eighth day after the full moon of Māgha. It marked the end 
of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	9 places the winter solstice in the new 
moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon 
preceding full moon in Māgha,
	10 not the new moon following 
full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for 
the importance of the Ekāṣṭakā as being the first Aṣṭakā 
after the beginning of the new year. 
It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether 
from the day after new moon to new moon — the system known 
as amānta, or from the day after full moon to full moon — the pūr- 
ṇimānta system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North 
India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi
	11 
argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and 
that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Nakṣatra could 
the month be known. Oldenberg
	12 points to the fact that the 
new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full 
moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with 
the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of 
the month into the former (pūrva) and latter (apara) halves, 
the first being the bright (śukla), the second the dark (kṛṣṇa) 
period. Thibaut
	13 considers that to assume the existence of 
the pūrṇimānta system for the Veda is unnecessary, though 
possible. Weber
	10 assumes that it occurs in the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably 
be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the 
amānta system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at 
least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as 
beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded 
full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the 
beginning of the month. 
That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the 
conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is 
given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the 
earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to.
	14 
It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas,
	15 and must be 
regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized. 
No other month is mentioned as such in the Brāhmaṇa 
literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different 
length occur. The Sāmaveda Sūtras
	16 refer to (1) years with 
324 days — i.e., periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each; 
(2) years with 351 days — i.e., periodic years with 12 months of 
27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with 
354 days — i.e., 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in 
other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or 
ordinary civil (sāvana) years; (5) years with 378 days, which, 
as Thibaut
	17 clearly shows, are third years, in which, after 
two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about 
correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of 
366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year 
of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotiṣa
	18 and to 
Garga.
	19 
That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of 
354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer,
	20 indeed, 
thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated 
at ten months, or sometimes a year.
	21 But Weber
	22 may be 
right in holding that the month is the periodic month of 
27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken. 
On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits 
the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month, 
so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant. 
The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly 
quite unscientific, Zimmer
	23 is strongly of opinion that it was 
only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took 
place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex, 
normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well 
known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days 
each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one 
in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days, 
or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year 
of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too 
long;
	24 but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the 
Brāhmaṇa period, during which no decision as to the true 
length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The 
references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda
	25 are not even 
reasonably plausible, while the pañcaka yuga, cited by him from 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	26 occurs only in a quotation in 
a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself. 
On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to 
bring the year of 360 days — a synodic lunar year — roughly 
into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra
	27 treats it as a 
solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in 
13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days 
every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But 
Vedic literature, from the Rigveda
	28 downwards,
	29 teems with 
the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month. 
The length is variously given as 30 days,
	30 35 days,
	31 or 
36 days.
	32 The last number possibly indicates an intercalation 
after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for 
this we have no special evidence. There are many references
	33 
to the year having 12 or 13 months. 
The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all 
ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in 
their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the 
fire-altar,’ is described.
	34 These names are the following: 
(1) Madhu, (2) Mādhava (spring months, vāsantikāv ṛtū); 
(3) Śukra, (4) Śuci (summer months, graiṣmāv ṛtū); (5) Nabha 
(or Nabhas),
	35 (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, vārṣikāv ṛtū); 
(7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, śāradāv ṛtū); (9) Saha (or 
Sahas),
	35 (10) Sahasya (winter months, haimantikāv ṛtū); 
(11) Tapa (or Tapas),
	35 (12) Tapasya (cool months, śaiśirāv 
ṛtū). 
There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma 
sacrifice
	36 and of the horse sacrifice,
	37 all of them agreeing in 
essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names,
	38 
but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in 
popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than 
a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu 
and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these 
two are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	39 as if actually 
employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that 
the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary 
use.
	40 
In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned. 
The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	41 is Aṃhasas
pati, while that given in the Taittirīya
	42 and Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitās
	43 is Saṃsarpa. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	44 gives it the 
name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with 
Saṃsarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names.
	45 The 
Atharvaveda
	46 describes it as sanisrasa, ‘slipping,’ owing no 
doubt to its unstable condition. 
The other method of naming the months is from the 
Nakṣatras. It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas, 
but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotiṣa
	47 
mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair 
interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identifica
tion of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the 
view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in 
Citrā, and not that in Phalgunī, is the beginning of the year.
	48 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	49 are found two curious ex
pressions, yava and ayava, for the light and dark halves of the 
month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half. 
Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling
	50 thinks, from yu, 
‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word Parvan 
(‘joint’ = division of time) probably
	51 denotes a half of the 
month, perhaps already in the Rigveda.
	52 More precisely the 
first half, the time of the waxing light, is called pūrva-pakṣa,
	53 
the second, that of the waning light, apara-pakṣa,
	54 Either of 
these might be called a half-month (ardha-māsa).

said is that a tendency to accept five years

was arising, which ultimately appears 
developed in the Jyotiṣa. But we cannot

to Phālguna is, of course, an error; 
for, owing to the precession of the 
equinoxes, Phālguna became the first 
month of spring de facto, while Caitra 
became virtually the last month of the 
preceding season. The truth is that 
the six seasons are an arbitrary division 
of the year, and that either Phālguna 
or Caitra could be regarded as the 
beginning of spring without much im
propriety. See Weber, Indische Studien,

mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 along with other kinds of grasses 
as the lurking-place of venomous creatures. In the same text

the Muñja grass is spoken of as purifying, apparently being 
used as the material of a filter for Soma. The grass is often 
mentioned in the later Saṃhitās

मुद्ग,
 denoting a kind of bean (Phascolus Mungo), occurs 
in a list of vegetables in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	1 A ‘soup of 
rice with beans’ (mudgaudana) is mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka
	2 and the Sūtras. Cf. perhaps Mudgala. 1) xviii. 12. 2) xii. 8. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 240.

मुद्गल
मुद्गल
 and Mudgalanī, ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in 
a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 variously inter
preted by Pischel
	2 and Geldner
	3 and von Bradke
	4 as telling 
of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, Mudgala 
won by his wife's aid. The Indian tradition is as variant as 
the interpretations of modern authorities. Ṣaḍguruśiṣya
	5 
explains that Mudgala's oxen were stolen, that he pursued the 
thieves with the one old ox he had left, and that hurling his 
hammer (dru-ghaṇa) he caught the marauders. Yāska,
	6 on the 
other hand, says that Mudgala won a race with a drughaṇa 
and an ox instead of with two oxen. It is pretty clear that, 
as Roth
	7 observed, the tradition is merely a guess, and a bad 
one, at the meaning of an obscure hymn, and this view is 
accepted by Oldenberg.
	8 Bloomfield
	9 has interpreted the 
legend as one of heavenly, not of human, events. Mudgala, 
probably a variant form of Mudgara,
	10 which in the later 
language means a hammer or a similar weapon, may be meant 
as a personification of the thunderbolt of Indra, rather than 
a real man.

	12 Mudgala is a mythical sage. 1) x. 102. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 124. 3) Ibid., 1, 138; 2, 1-22. 4) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen-

mythical character of the passage. 11) If the name means a real man, it 
may be connected with Mudga, ‘bean.’

मुनि
मुनि
 occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda
	1 where it seems to 
denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus (deveṣita), 
the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This 
agrees with the fact that Aitaśa, the Muni, is in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 regarded by his son as deranged, a view not 
unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa.
	3 
‘Chatter of Aitaśa,’ was really his. The Rigveda
	4 calls Indra 
the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda
	5 refers to a ‘divine 
Muni’ (deva muni), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant. 
In the Upaniṣads
	6 the Muni is of a more restrained type: 
he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute, 
by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith (śraddhā). 
It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute 
distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both 
cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal 
of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the 
Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor 
would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness 
of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was 
an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not 
approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose 
views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni, 
which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the 
desire for children and Dakṣiṇās.

मुनिमरण
मुनि-मरण,
 ‘Saints’ Death,’ is the name of the place 
where, according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 4, 7), the 
Vaikhanasas were slain.

मुलालिन्
मुलालिन्
 (masc.) or Mulālī (fem.) is the name of some part 
of an edible lotus (perhaps the Nymphaea esculenta) in the 
Atharvaveda.

मुषीवन्
मुषीवन्
 denotes ‘robber’ in one passage of the Rigveda 
(i. 42, 3).

मुष्कर
मुष्कर
 occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	1 possibly 
in the sense of a small animal or insect, as suggested by Roth,
	2 
who, however, thought the passage corrupt. Bloomfield

suggests that the reading of the Paippalāda text puṣkaram, 
(‘blue lotus’) is the correct form. 1) vi. 14, 2. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 463, 464.

मुष्टिहन्
मुष्टि-हन्,
 
	1 Muṣṭi-hatyā,
	2 in the Rigveda and the Atharva
veda denote. respectively, the ‘hand to hand fighter’ — that is, 
the ordinary warrior as opposed to the charioteer, and the 
‘fight’ itself. So also in the Atharvaveda
	3 the charioteer 
(rathin) is opposed to the foot-soldier (patti), and in the 
Rigveda
	4 the chariots are opposed to the troops (grāma) of the 
infantry. The parallel of the Greek and other Āryan races 
shows that the Kṣatriyas were the fighters from chariots, while 
the ordinary host fought on foot. 1) Rv. v. 58, 4; vi. 26, 2; viii. 20, 20; Av. v. 22, 4. 2) Rv. i. 8, 2. 3) vii. 62, 1. 4) i. 100, 10.

मुसल
मुसल
 denotes a ‘pestle’ in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and in the 
Brāhmaṇas.

Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 42, 44 (Journal 
of the American Oriental Society, 15, 235, 
237), musalin means a ‘man armed with 
a club.’

मुहूर्त
मुहूर्त
 denotes a division of time, one-thirtieth of a day, 
or an hour of forty-eight minutes, in the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 In the 
Rigveda
	2 the sense of ‘moment’ only is found. Cf. Ahan. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 1, 1

‘moment’ is also common in the 
Brāhmaṇas.

मूचीप
मूचीप
 or Mūvīpa is the variant in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra (xv. 26, 6) of the Mūtiba of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa as 
the name of a barbarian tribe. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 67, n. 1.

मूजवत्|मूजवन्त्
मूजवन्त्
 is the name of a people who, along with the 
Mahāvṛṣas, the Gandhāris, and the Balhikas, are mentioned 
in the Atharvaveda
	1 as dwelling far away, and to whom 
fever is to be banished. Similarly in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	2 
the Mūjavants are chosen as a type of distant folk, beyond 
which Rudra with his bow is entreated to depart. In the 
Rigveda
	3 Soma is described as Maujavata, ‘coming from the 
Mūjavants,’ or, as Yāska
	4 takes it, ‘from Mount Mūjavant.’ 
The Indian commentators
	5 agree with Yāska in taking Mūja
vant as the name of a mountain, and though Hillebrandt
	6 is 
justified in saying that the identification of Mūjavant by 
Zimmer
	7 with one of the lower hills on the south-west of 
Kaśmīr lacks evidence, it is not reasonable to deny that 
Mūjavant was a hill from which the people took their name. 
Yāska
	8 suggests that Mūjavant is equivalent to Muñjavant, 
which actually occurs later, in the Epic,
	9 as the name of a 
mountain in the Himālaya. 1) v. 22, 5, 7, 8. 14. Cf. Baudhāyana

मृग
1. Mṛga has the generic sense of ‘wild beast’ in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 Sometimes it is qualified by the epithet ‘terrible’ 
(bhīma),
	3 which indicates that a savage wild beast is meant. 
Elsewhere the buffalo is shown to be denoted by the epithet 
mahiṣa,
	4 ‘powerful,’ which later becomes the name of the 
buffalo. More particularly the word has the sense of an animal 
of the gazelle type.
	5 In some passages
	6 Roth
	7 sees the sense 
of ‘bird.’ See also Mṛga Hastin, Puruṣa Hastin. 1) i. 173, 2; 191, 4; viii. 1, 20; 5, 36;

Cf. Pischel, Vedische Studien, i. 99;

मृग
2. Mṛga in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes, according to 
Sāyaṇa's commentary, the constellation Mṛgaśiras. But it 
seems more probable
	2 that Mṛga there really covers the whole 
of Orion, not merely the inconspicuous group of stars in the 
head of Orion that make up the Nakṣatra Mṛgaśiras, but also 
the star a in his shoulder, which is reckoned as Ārdrā, and  
in his left shoulder. Tilak,
	3 however, makes Mṛga or Mṛgaśiras 
into a different group, consisting of the belt of Orion, with two 
stars in the knees and one in the left shoulder, which he 
deems to resemble a deer's head with an arrow through it, 
an implausible and unlikely theory. Cf. Mṛgavyādha. 1) iii. 33, 5. 2) See Whitney, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, xcii. 3) Orion, 99 et seq.

मृगहस्तिन्
3. Mṛga Hastin, the ‘animal with a hand,’ is mentioned in 
two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 in which Roth
	2 recognizes that 
the elephant is meant, but concludes that the compound name 
is a proof of the newness of the elephant to the Vedic Indians.
	3 
Later the adjective Hastin alone became the regular name of 
the animal (like Mahiṣa of the ‘buffalo’). The elephant is 
also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mṛga 
Vāraṇa,
	4 the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective vāraṇa 
similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later 
language. Pischel's view
	5 that the catching of elephants by 
the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the 
Rigveda
	6 seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	7 
elephants are described as ‘black, white-toothed, adorned with 
gold.’ 1) i. 64, 7; iv. 16, 14. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.; Nirukta, Erläuterungen, 79. 3) Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 99, 100, 
combats the view that the elephant was 
new to the Vedic Indian, because of 
the similar use of mṛga mahiṣa and 
mṛga sūkara (Av. xii. 1, 48) to denote 
the ‘buffalo’ and the ‘boar’ respec
tively. But Mahiṣa seems rather to 
bear out Roth's conclusion; while 
Sūkara appears alone in the Rigveda, 
and mṛga sūkara, ‘wild hog,’ seems to 
be used in one passage of the Av. 
(xii. 1, 48) to distinguish it from Varāha, 
‘boar,’ in the same verse. 4) Rv. viii. 33, 8; x. 40, 8. 5) Vedische Studien, 2, 121-123; 317

2, 122.

मृगय
मृगय
 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 as 
defeated by Indra. That he was a human foe, as Ludwig
	2 
thinks, seems unlikely: more probably he was a demon, as 
Mṛga unquestionably is.

मृगयु
मृगयु,
 ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the 
Brāhmaṇas,
	2 but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	3 
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	4 however, in the list of victims 
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of 
names which seem to be those of persons who make a liveli
hood by fishing or by hunting, such as the Mārgāra, ‘hunter,’ 
the Kaivarta or Kevarta, Pauñjiṣṭha, Daśa, Maināla, ‘fisher 
man,’ and perhaps the Bainda and the Ānda,
	5 who seem to 
have been some sort of fishermen. 
It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period 
hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the 
Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture (Kṛṣi) were, no 
doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be 
unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done, 
both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for 
protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally 
our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The 
arrow was sometimes employed,
	6 but, as is usual with primitive 
man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls. 
Birds were regularly caught in nets (Pāśa,
	7 Nidhā,
	8 Jāla),
	9 The 
bird-catcher being called nidhā-pati,
	10 ‘master of snares.’ The 
net was fastened on pegs
	11 (as is done with modern nets for 
catching birds). Another name of net is apparently Mukṣījā. 
Pits were used for catching antelopes (Ṛśya), and so were 
called ṛśya-da,
	12 ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured 
as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame 
females (see Mṛga Hastin). Apparently the boar was captured 
in the chase, dogs being used,
	13 but the passage from which 
this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content. 
There is also an obscure reference
	14 to the capture of the 
buffalo (Gaura), but it is not clear whether the reference is to 
shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes, 
perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls,
	15 
or was surrounded by the hunters and slain;
	16 one very obscure 
passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which 
perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit.
	17 
The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only 
evidence available are the explanations of the various names 
mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sāyaṇa
	18 says that Dhaivara is 
one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Dāśa and 
Śauṣkala do so by means of a fish-hook (baḍiśa); Bainda, 
Kaivarta, and Maināla by means of a net (jāla); Mārgāra 
catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in 
pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); Parṇaka 
by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these 
explanations can claim much authority. 1) Av. x. 1, 26; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,

मृगव्याध
मृग-व्याध,
 ‘the hunter,’ is the name of Sirius in the 
legend of Prajāpati's daughter in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 
Prajāpati (Orion) pursues his daughter (Rohiṇī), and is shot 
by the archer Sirius. The transference of the legend of 
Prajāpati to the sky is no doubt secondary, caused by the 
obvious similarity of the constellation in question to the idea 
of an archer. 1) iii. 33, 5. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 2, 205, n. 1, 208, n. 3; Tilak,

मृड

 is found only in compounds in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,

मृत्यु
मृत्यु,
 ‘death,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and later
	2 as a thing of terror. There are a hundred and one 
forms of death, the natural one by old age
	3 (jarā), and a 
hundred others, all to be avoided.
	4 To die before old age 
(purā jarasaḥ)
	5 is to die before the allotted span (purā āyuṣaḥ),
	6 
the normal length of life being throughout Vedic literature 
spoken of as a hundred years.
	7 On the other hand, the evils 
of old age in the loss of physical strength were clearly realized.
	8 
one of the feats of the Aśvins was to restore old Cyavāna to 
his former youth and powers, and another was the rejuvenation 
of Kali.
	9 The Atharvaveda
	10 is full of charms of all sorts to 
avert death and secure length of years (āyuṣya). 
The modes of disposing of the dead were burial and cremation 
(see Agnidagdha). Both existed in the early Vedic period,
	11 
as in Greece;
	12 but the former method was on the whole less 
favoured, and tended to be regarded with disapproval. The 
bones of the dead, whether burned or not, were marked by the 
erection of a tumulus (Śmaśāna): the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	13 
preserves traces of strong differences of opinion as to the mode 
in which these tumuli should be constructed. There is little 
or no trace
	14 of the custom common in northern lands of 
sending the dead man to sea in a burning ship: the reference 
to a ship
	15 seems to point to mythical perils after death, not to 
the mode of burial. 
The life after death was to the Vedic Indian a repetition of 
the life in this world. He passed into the next world sarva- 
tanuḥ sāṅgaḥ, ‘with whole body and all his members,’
	16 enjoying 
there the same pleasures as he had enjoyed on earth. Even 
in the Rigveda
	17 there are hints of evil awaiting evil-doers, but 
it is not until the Atharvaveda
	18 and the Brāhmaṇas
	19 that 
a hell of punishment is set out, and it is in the Brāhmaṇas
	20 
that good and evil deeds are said to produce happiness or hell 
hereafter. But there is no hint of extinction
	21 in the Rigveda 
as the fate of the wicked, as Roth
	22 inclined to think. The 
Vedic poet not being deeply moral, his verses do not convey, 
as would those of a man convinced of sin, warnings of future 
judgment. 1) vii. 59, 12; x. 13, 4; 18, 1, 2;

मेथि
मेथि
 is found in the Atharvaveda
	1 denoting ‘post.’ The 
word is also found in the marriage ritual,
	2 when the sense is, 
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a post to support 
the pole of a chariot. In one passage of the Rigveda it is 
perhaps used of posts forming a palisade.
	3 In the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	4 it appears in the form of Methī to denote the post 
to which the sacrificial cow is tied. The word is very variously 
spelt, Medhi and Meṭhī also being found. 1) viii. 5, 20. 2) Av. xiv. 1, 40. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, vi. 2, 9, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xxv. 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29, 22;

schaft, 48, 109). 4) xiii. 9, 17. Cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 19, 1 (Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 23, 329).

मेध
मेध
 is a word of uncertain sense occurring in a Vālakhilya 
hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 According to the St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, the proper name of a sacrificer may be meant. 1) viii. 50, 10 (cf. viii. 49, 10), where, as a rule, the sense of ‘sacrifice’ is 
accepted as adequate.

मेधातिथि
मेधातिथि,
 
	1 Medhyātithi
	2 (‘having a guest at the sacrifice’) 
appear to be the names of one and the same man, a descendant 
of Kaṇva and a famous Vedic Ṛṣi, to whom the authorship of 
various hymns
	3 is attributed in the Anukramaṇī (Index). To 
him Indra is said in the Rigveda
	4 to have come in the form 
of a ram: this myth is perpetuated in the Subrahmaṇyā 
formula
	5 recited by the priest while the Soma is being carried 
within the sacrificial enclosure, when Indra is hailed as ‘ram 
of Medhātithi.’ He appears also as a rival of Vatsa, whom he 
accused of low birth, but who convinced him of his error by 
undergoing a fire ordeal (cf. Divya).
	6 In the Atharvaveda
	7 he 
is mentioned with many other sages, and occurs elsewhere
	8 
also as a sage. 1) This is the form of the later texts 
and of Rv. viii. 8, 20, where he occurs 
with Kaṇva. 2) This is the usual form in the Rv.: 
i. 36, 10. 11. 17; viii. 1, 30; 2, 40; 
33, 4; 49, 9; 51, 1; ix. 43, 3. 3) i. 12-23; viii. 1-3; 22. 23; ix. 41
43. In the ascriptions Medhātithi and 
Medhyātithi are confused. 4) viii. 2, 40. Cf. i. 51, 1, where, 
however, there is no mention of Medhā
ithi. 5) Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 79; Ṣaḍ
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 18; Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka, i. 12, 3. Moreover, the 
legend is alluded to in the Śāṭyāyanaka. 
See Sāyaṇa on Rv. i. 51, 1; viii. 2, 40, 
and Oertel, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 16, ccxl. On the ex
planation of the legend, cf. Weber, 
Indische Studien, 9, 38 et seq. 6) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 6, 6. 7) iv. 29, 6. 8) As a Gṛhapati at the sacrifice of the 
Vibhindukīyas, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,

मेध्य
मेध्य
 is the name of a man, an ancient sacrificer, in a 
hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 he 
is erroneously transmuted into Pṛṣadhra Medhya Mātariśvan, 
the patron of Praskaṇva Kāṇva. 1) viii. 52, 2. 2) xvi. 11, 26.

 See 2. Menā.

मेना
1. Menā in a few passages of the Rigveda denotes ‘woman.’
	1 
The word is also used in the sense of the ‘female’ of an 
animal, either mare
	2 or cow.
	3 1) Rv. i. 62, 7; 95, 6; ii. 39, 2. 2) Rv. i. 121, 2. 3) x. 111, 3. 
Cf. Pischel, Indische Studien, 2, 316, 
317.

मेना
2. Menā 
	1 or Menakā
	2 is mentioned in the Rigveda
	3 and in 
the Brāhmaṇas
	4 as the daughter, or perhaps wife, of Vṛṣaṇaśva. 
The meaning of the legend connected with her is quite 
unknown. Cf. Maināka or Mainaga. 1) This is the ordinary form of the 
name. 2) So Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, where 
the masculine form Mena is the epithet 
of Vṛṣaṇaśva. 3) Rv. i. 51, 13, where Sāyaṇa tells 
the legend from the Śāṭyāyanaka. Cf. 
Oertel, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 16, ccxl. 4) Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, i. 1; Śata

मेष
मेष
 denotes ‘ram’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 while Meṣī 
means ‘sheep.’
	3 Both words are also used to denote the 
‘wool’
	4 of the sheep, especially as employed for the Soma 
filter. A wild (āraṇya) ram is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā.

Oriental Society, 17, 66, 67.

मेहत्नू
मेहत्नू
 is the name of a stream in the Nadīstuti (‘Praise 
of Rivers’) in the Rigveda.
	1 It must apparently have been 
a tributary of the Sindhu (Indus), entering that river before 
the Krumu (Kurum) and Gomatī (Gomal). It may conceivably 
have been a tributary of the Krumu. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 5, 344.

मैत्रायणीयब्राह्मण
मैत्रायणीय ब्राह्मण
 is the name of a text mentioned in 
the Śulba Sūtra of Baudhāyana.
	1 1) Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xxxii. 8. 
Cf. Caland, Über das rituclle Sūtra des 
Baudhāyana, 41, who cannot trace the 
citation in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.

मैत्रेय
मैत्रेय
 is the patronymic or metronymic
	1 of Kauṣārava in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	2 It is also applied to Glāva in the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	3 1) Patronymic from Mitrayu, accord
ing to Pāṇini, vi. 4, 174; vii. 3, 2; 
metronymic from Mitrā, according to 
the commentator on Chāndogya Upani
ṣad, i. 12, 1. 2) viii. 28, 18. 3) i. 12, 1; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1,

मैनाक
मैनाक,
 ‘descendant of Menakā,’ is the name of a mountain 
among the Himālayas in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	1 There is 
a various reading Maināga. 1) i. 31, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 78; Indian Literature, 93.

मैनाल
मैनाल
 occurs in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 It seems clearly to 
mean ‘fisherman’ from Mīna, ‘fish,’ as Sāyaṇa
	2 and Mahī
dhara
	3 explain it. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Tait

मौजवत
 See Mūjavant.

मौद्गल्य
मौद्गल्य,
 ‘descendant of Mudgala,’ is the patronymic of 
several persons, Nāka,
	1 Śatabalākṣa,
	2 and Lāṅgalāyana.
	3 A 
Brahmacārin of the name is mentioned in the Gopatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	4 as disputing with Glāva Maitreya. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 5, 2, 1; 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 4;

मौन,
 ‘descendant of Muni,’ is the patronymic of Aṇīcin 
in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxiii. 5).

मौषिकीपुत्र
मौषिकी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Mūṣikā,’ is 
the name of a teacher, a pupil of Hārikarṇīputra in the last 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30).

म्लेच्छ
म्लेच्छ
 occurs in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 in the sense of 
a barbarian in speech. The Brahmin is there forbidden to 
use barbarian speech. The example
	2 given of such speech is 
lie 'lavo, explained by Sāyaṇa as he 'rayaḥ, ‘ho, foes.’ If this 
is correct — the Kāṇva recension has a different reading
	3 — the 
barbarians referred to were Āryan speakers, though not speakers 
of Sanskrit, but of a Prākṛta form of speech.

यक्ष
यक्ष
 is found several times in the Rigveda
	1 and the Athar
vaveda
	2 in passages in which Ludwig
	3 sees the meaning of a 
feast or holy practice in accordance with the native com
mentators. It is, however, very doubtful whether this sense 
ever occurs.

यक्षु
यक्षु
 is mentioned, once in the singular and once in the 
plural, in the hymn of the Rigveda
	1 which celebrates Sudās 
battle with the ten kings. Who they were and what part they 
played in that conflict is quite uncertain. They seem, from the 
wording of the text, to have taken part in two conflicts, as 
Zimmer
	2 says — one on the Paruṣṇī (Ravi), and one on the 
Yamunā (Jumna) — with the aid of the Ajas and Śigrus, under 
the leadership of Bḥeda. It is, however, at least possible that 
in the former passage Yadu should be read for Yakṣu, or, at 
any rate, Yakṣu be deemed a contemptuous substitute of the 
name of a possibly un-Āryan or unimportant tribe (as their 
allies, the Ajas and Śigrus, clearly were) for the name of the 
certainly famous Yadus, as is suggested by Hopkins.
	3 Cf. 
Turvaśa. 1) vii. 18, 6. 19. 2) Altindisches Leben, 126, 127. 3) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 259 et seq. It is not clear 
however, whether Hopkins thinks that 
the Yadus are alluded to, but it seems 
probable.

यक्ष्म
यक्ष्म
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 frequently 
denotes ‘illness,’ in general, perhaps as rendering the body 
emaciated. A hundred kinds of Yakṣma are referred to in the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,
	3 and a-yakṣma in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	4 
denotes ‘free from disease.’ In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	5 an 
account is given of the origin of Yakṣma, which is distinguished 
as of three kinds — Rāja-yakṣma, ‘royal Yakṣma,’ Pāpa-yakṣma, 
‘evil Yakṣma,’ and Jāyenya, most probably ‘syphilis.’ The 
second of the series is elsewhere unknown, and can hardly be 
defined, for it merely means ‘serious or deadly disease.’ Cf. 
also Ajñātayakṣma. 1) i. 122, 9; x. 85, 31; 97, 11. 12;

यजत
 occurs in a hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 where he is 
apparently a Ṛṣi or a sacrificer. 1) v. 44, 10, 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138.

यजुर्वेद
यजुर्-वेद,
 the ‘Veda of the sacrificial utterance’ (Yajus), 
is mentioned frequently in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 and Upaniṣads.
	2 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 12, 9, 1; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 32, 1; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 5, 8, 3; xii. 3, 4, 9. 2) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 3, 5; 
Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, viii. 3, 8; 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 5, 5; ii. 4. 
10; iv. 1, 2; 5, 11; Chāndogya Upar 
ṣad, i. 3, 7; iii. 2, 1. 2; 15, 7; vii. 
2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1; Āśvalāyana Sra 
Sūtra, x. 7, 2; Sāṅkhāyana Sra 
Sūtra, xvi. 2, 6, etc.

यजुस्
यजुस्
 is repeatedly distinguished from the Ṛc and the Sāman 
in Vedic literature.
	1 The Yajus is the utterance accompanying 
the sacrifice, and may have the form of verse or prose, the tern 
covering both. 1) Rv. x. 90, 9; Av. v. 26, 1; ix. 6, 2; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 3, 1; 9, 4; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 30; iv. 1; 
xix. 28; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 29, 21; 
viii. 13, 2; Śatapatha Brahmaṇa, i. 2, 
1, 7; vi. 5, 1, 2; 3, 4, etc. In the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 33, 
there is a reference to the śuklāni 
Yajūṃṣi, ‘white or pure Yajus,’ as 
promulgated by Vājasaneya Yājña- 
valkya, whence the Vājasaneyi Saṃ
hītā is popularly known as the ‘White 
Yajurveda.’ The theory that this is 
due to the fact that in the Vājasaneyi 
the Mantra parts of the text are not 
accompanied by Brāhmaṇa passages 
is, though accepted by Weber, Indian 
Literature, 103, 104; Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 12, xxvii, and others, 
now to be abandoned. In the Taittirīya 
Āraṇyaka, v. 10, the expression śukra- 
yajāṃṣi seems to refer to books iv. and 
v. of that text. Cf. also Winternitz.

यज्ञगाथा
यज्ञ-गाथा
 denotes a verse (Gāthā) containing a maxim as 
to the sacrifice of any kind or sort,
	1 or, as it is expressed in the 
Mahābhārata,
	2 a ‘verse sung regarding the sacrifice’ (gāthā 
yajña-gītā). 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 43, 5; 
Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, ii. 12, 6; 
Śānkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xvi. 8, 26; 
9, 6, etc. 2) xii. 791. 2316.

यज्ञवचस्राजस्तम्बायन
यज्ञ-वचस् राजस्तम्बायन,
 ‘descendant of Rājastamba,’ 
is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Tura Kāvaṣeya, according 
to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 He is also mentioned in the 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.
	2 1) x. 4, 2, 1; 6, 5, 9; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 5, 4 Kāṇva. 2) iii. 10, 3; iv. 8, 2.

यज्ञसेन
यज्ञ-सेन
 is the name of a teacher with the patronymic 
Caitra or Caitriyāyaṇa mentioned in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 3, 8, 1 (Caitriyāyaṇa); Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 4 
(Caitra).

यज्ञेषु
यज्ञेषु
 is the name of a man in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 
He was made to prosper by his priest Mātsya, who knew the 
exact moment of sacrificing. 1) i. 5, 2, 1. Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 306.

यज्ञोपवीत
यज्ञोपवीत
 denotes the ‘wearing of the Brahminical thread 
over the left shoulder at the sacrifice,’ and is mentioned as early 
as the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Tilak,
	2 however, urges that it 
was not originally a thread that was worn, but a garment of 
cloth (Vāsas) or of deerskin (Ajina). This seems quite probable. 1) iii. 10, 9, 12. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, ii. 5, 11, 1; Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 4, 2, 1; 6, 1, 12; and Prācīnāvīta. 2) Orion, 145 et seq., quoting Tait
tirīya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, and, the view of 
the Mīmāmsists, Jaiminīyanyāyamālā
vistara, iii. 4, 1. This view is not 
prejudiced by the quite implausible 
conjectures as to Orion's belt with 
which it is combined. Cf. Eggeling, 
Sacred Books o the East, 12, 361, 
424.

यति
यति
 is the name of an ancient clan which is connected with 
the Bhṛgus in two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 where the Yatis 
certainly seem to be real persons. In another hymn,
	2 however, 
they already appear as almost mythical. In the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās,
	3 and elsewhere,
	4 the Yatis are a race whom Indra, in 
an evil moment, gave over to the hyænas (Sālāvṛka): exactly 
what is referred to is uncertain. Yati is mentioned with Bhṛgu 
in a verse of the Sāmaveda.

Texts, 12, 437 et seq. 4) ii. 304. In the parallel passage,

possibly an error for Yatīn, or merely 
a blunder. Cf. Muir, op. cit., 5, 49,

Atharvaveda, 44; Āśvalāyana Śrauta

Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 146.

यदु
यदु
 is the name of a tribe and of the king of the tribe. 
They are mentioned repeatedly in the Rigveda,
	1 normally in 
conjunction with Turvaśa. They seem to have taken part in 
the great battle against Sudās:
	2 the Yadu and the Turvaśa 
kings seem to have escaped with their lives, while the Anu and 
the Druhyu kings perished. This is at least the most natural 
explanation of several passages,
	3 though these passages possibly 
refer to a successful raid across the Sarayu, and a defeat of two 
princes, Arṇa and Citraratha.
	4 That Turvaśa was the Yadu 
king, as Hopkins
	5 holds, is most improbable. 1) i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; 
v. 31, 8; vi. 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 
9, 14; 10, 5; 45, 27; ix. 61, 2; x. 49, 8; 
plural, i. 108, 8. See Turvaśa, and 
Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 258 et seq. 2) Whether Yadu should be read in 
Rv. vii. 18, 6, or not, the Yadus seem 
to be meant. Cf. Yakṣu. 3) Rv. i. 174, 9; iv. 30, 17; v. 31, 3; 
vi. 20, 12. 4) Rv. iv. 30, 18. 5) Loc. cit.

यन्तृ
यन्तृ
 in the Rigveda
	1 and in the Sūtras
	2 denotes a ‘driver’ 
of horses or ‘charioteer.’ 1) i. 162, 19; x. 22, 5. 2) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 6, 29, etc.

यम
यम
 denotes ‘twins,’ the birth of which is frequently 
alluded to in Vedic literature.
	1 Twins of different sex seem to 
be indicated by the expression yamau mithunau.
	2 There are 
traces of the belief — widely spread among negro and other 
races — that twins are uncanny and of evil omen,
	3 but there are 
also vestiges of the opposite opinion, that twins are lucky.

यमसू
यम-सू,
 a ‘bearer of twins,’ is one of the victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 15; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 11, 1.

यमुना
यमुना,
 ‘twin,’ the name of a river, so called as running 
parallel with the Ganges, is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda,
	1 
and not rarely later. According to the Rigveda,
	2 the Tṛtsus and 
Sudās won a great victory against their foes on the Yamunā; 
there is no reason
	3 whatever to accept Hopkins'
	4 view that the 
Yamunā here was another name of the Paruṣṇī (Ravi). In the 
Atharvaveda
	5 the salve (Āñjana) of the Yamunā (Yāmuna) is 
mentioned along with that of Trikakud (Traikakuda) as of value. 
In the Aitareya
	6 and the Śatapatha
	7 Brāhmaṇas the Bharatas 
are famed as victorious on the Yamunā. Other Brāhmaṇas
	8 
also mention this river. In the Mantrapāṭha
	9 the Sālvas are 
spoken of as dwelling on its banks. 1) v. 52, 17; vii. 18, 19; x. 75, 5. 2) vii. 18, 19. See Bharata and Kuru. 3) The Tṛtsus’ territory lay between 
the Yamunā and the Sarasvatī on the 
east and the west respectively. 4) India, Old and New, 52. 5) iv. 9, 10. 6) viii. 23. 7) xiii. 5, 4, 11. 8) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 4, 11

ययाति
ययाति
 is mentioned twice in the Rigveda,
	1 once as an ancient 
sacrificer, and once as Nahuṣya, ‘descendant of Nahuṣa,’ 
apparently a king. There is no trace whatever of his connexion 
with Pūru, as in the Epic,
	2 the tradition of which must be 
deemed to be inaccurate. 1) i. 31, 17; x. 63, 1. 2) Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 147; Muir, Sanskrit Texts 
12, 232.

यव
1. Yava in the Rigveda
	1 appears to be a generic term for 
any sort of ‘grain,’ and not merely ‘barley.’ The latter sense 
is probably found in the Atharvaveda,
	2 and is regular later. 
The barley harvest came after spring,
	3 in the summer.
	4 That 
barley was cultivated in the period of the Rigveda
	5 is not 
certain, but on the whole very probable.

meaning ‘mixed with grain.’ 1) i. 187, 9; ii. 22, 1; iii. 42, 7; 
viii. 94, 4. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische

यव्यावती
यव्यावती
 is the name of a river in the Rigveda
	1 and in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	2 Hillebrandt
	3 thinks that the river is 
one in Iran, the Djob (Zhobe), near the Iryāb (Haliāb), but 
there is no reason to accept this identification. 1) vi. 27, 6. 2) xxv. 7, 2. 3) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 268, n. 1.

यशस्विन् जयन्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the 
name of a teacher, a pupil of Kṛṣṇarāta Triveda Lauhitya in 
the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāh
maṇa (iii. 42, 1).

यष्टि
यष्टि,

याज्ञवल्क्य
याज्ञ-वल्क्य,
 ‘descendant of Yajñavalkya,’ is repeatedly 
mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 as an authority on 
questions of ritual. He is, however, also given as an authority 
on questions of philosophy in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	2 
but Oldenberg
	3 is, no doubt, right in thinking that no possible 
importance can be attached to the mention of Yājñavalkya in 
the latter capacity. He is said to have been a pupil of 
Uddālaka Āruṇi,
	4 whom he opposed successfully in a dispute.
	5 
His two wives, Maitreyī and Kātyāyanī, are mentioned in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	6 which concludes
	7 with a passage 
ascribing to Yājñavalkya Vājasaneya the ‘white Yajus’ (śuklāni 
yajūṃṣi). It is remarkable that Yājñavalkya is never mentioned 
in any other Vedic text outside the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
except the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	8 where, however, both 
reference are merely transcripts from the Śatapatha.
	9 It has 
been supposed by Oldenberg
	10 and others that Yājñavalkya 
belonged to Videha, but despite the legend of Janaka's patronage 
of him, his association with Uddālaka, the Kuru-Pañcāla, 
renders this doubtful. 1) i. 1, 1, 9; 3, 1, 21. 26; 9, 3, 16; 
ii. 3, 1, 21; 4, 3, 2; 5, 1, 2 (where he

8, 2, 24 (cursed by a Caraka teacher); 
iv. 2, 1, 7; 6, 1, 10; 8, 7, etc. There 
are no references to Yājñavalkya in 
books v-ix, which, on the contrary, 
owe their doctrine to Tura Kāvaṣeya 
and Śāṇḍilya; but the fame of Yājña
valkya revives in books x-xiv — e.g.,

यातुविद्
यातु-विद्,
 denoting in the plural ‘those who know sorcery,’ 
designates the Atharvaveda in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) x. 5, 2, 20. Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, xxii.; Atharvaveda, 
1. 8, 9, 23.

याद्व
याद्व,
 ‘descendant of Yadu,’ is used of the Yadu prince in 
one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 while the largesse of the Yādvas
	2 
is alluded to elsewhere. In another passage a beast (paśu) of 
the Yadus or Yādvas is mentioned.
	3 Cf. Yadu. 1) vii. 19, 8. 2) Rv. viii. 6, 46. Cf. Ludwig, Trans
lation of the Rigveda, 5, 142. 3) Rv. viii. 1, 31.

Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vi. 3, 10; Chān

याम
याम,
 used in the plural, denotes in one passage of the 
Atharvaveda,
	1 according to Roth,
	2 the planets among which the 
sun (bhaga) wanders. But both Bloomfield
	3 and Whitney
	4 
accept the sense — the regular one in the later language — of 
‘night watches.’ 1) vi. 21, 2. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1d. 3) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 30. 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda,

यायावर
यायावर
 
	1 denotes a person of no fixed abode in the Yajur
veda Saṃhitās.
	2 1) Literally, ‘wandering about,’ from 
the intensive of yā, ‘to go.’ 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 1, 7; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 12.

याव
याव
 See Māsa.

यास्क
यास्क
 (‘descendant of Yaska’) is mentioned in the first two 
Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	1 as 
a contemporary of Āsurāyaṇa and a teacher of Bhāradvāja. 
Whether Yāska, author of the Nirukta,
	2 was the same person, 
it is, of course, impossible to say. 1) ii. 5, 21; iv. 5, 27 (Mādhyaṃdina 
= ii. 6, 3; iv. 6, 3 Kāṇva). Cf. Weber, 
Indian Literature, 128. 2) Ṛgveda Prātiśākhya, xvii. 25;

Studien, 1, 17, 103; 3, 396; 8, 243, etc.; 
Indian Literature, 41, n. 30.

यु
यु,
 appearing in the dual in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 
4, 10), seems to mean ‘yoke animals.’

युक्त
युक्त
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (vi. 7, 4, 8; xii. 4, 1, 2) 
denotes a ‘yoke’ of oxen. Cf. 1. Yuga.

युक्ताश्व
युक्ताश्व
 is the name of a man who is mentioned in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the seer of a Sāman, or chant. He 
is said to have exposed a pair of twins,
	2 but Hopkins
	3 thinks 
that the reference is only to an exchange of children. 1) xi. 8, 8. 2) Cf. Weber, Naxatra, 2, 314, n., 
whose view is that of Sāyaṇa on the 
passage. Cf. Yama. 3) Transactions of the Connecticut Academy 
of Arts and Sciences, 15, 61, 62. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie. 
2, 160.

युग
1. Yuga in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘yoke.’ Cf. 
Ratha. 1) i. 115, 2; 184, 3; ii. 39, 4; iii. 53, 
17; viii. 80, 7; x. 60, 8; 101, 3, etc. 2) Av. iv. 1, 40; Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, iii. 5, 1, 24. 34; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 3, etc.

युग
2. Yuga in the Rigveda
	1 frequently denotes a ‘generation’; 
but the expression daśame yuge applied to Dīrghatamas in one 
passage
	2 must mean ‘tenth decade’ of life. 
There is no reference in the older Vedic texts to the five-year 
cycle (see Saṃvatsara). The quotation from the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	3 given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, and by 
Zimmer
	4 and others, is merely a citation from a modern text 
in the commentary on that work. 
Nor do the older Vedic texts know of any series of Yugas or 
ages such as are usual later. In the Atharvaveda
	5 there are 
mentioned in order a hundred years, an ayuta (10,000?), and 
then two, three, or four Yugas: the inference from this seems 
to be that a Yuga means more than an ayuta, but is not very 
certain. Zimmer
	6 adduces a passage from the Rigveda,
	7 
but the reference there, whatever it may be,
	8 is certainly 
not to the four ages (cf. also Triyuga).
	9 The Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa
	10 recognizes long periods of time — e.g., one of 
100,000 years. 
To the four ages, Kali, Dvāpara, Tretā, and Kṛta, there is no 
certain reference in Vedic literature, though the names occur as 
the designations of throws at dice (see Akṣa). In the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	11 the names occur, but it is not clear that the ages 
are really meant. Haug
	12 thought that the dice were meant: 
this view is at least as probable as the alternative explanation, 
which is accepted by Weber,
	13 Roth,
	14 Wilson,
	15 Max Müller,
	16 
and Muir.
	17 Roth, indeed, believes that the verse is an inter
polation; but in any case it must be remembered that the 
passage is from a late book of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. Four 
ages — Puṣya, Dvāpara, Khārvā, and Kṛta — are mentioned in 
the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	18 and the Dvāpara in the Gopatha 
Brāhmaṇa.
	19 1) Yuge-yuge, ‘in every age,’ i. 139, 8; 
iii. 26, 3; vi. 8, 5; 15, 8; 36, 5; ix. 94, 
12; uttarā yugāni, ‘future ages,’ iii. 33, 8; 
x. 10, 10; pūrvāṇi yugāni, vii. 70, 4; 
uttare yuge, x. 72, 1, etc. In i. 92, 11; 
103, 4; 115, 2; 124, 2; 144, 4, etc., the 
phrase ‘generations of men’ (manṣyā, 
manuṣaḥ, janānām) are referred 
to. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 12, 45, 46. 2) i. 158, 6. Wilson, Translation, 2, 
104, n., suggests that yuga here means 
a lustrum of five years; but the tenth 
decade is far more likely, as Dīrgha
tamas is said to be ‘aged’ (jujurvān). 3) xvii. 13, 17. 4) Altindisches Leben, 368. 5) viii. 2, 21. 6) Op. cit., 371. 7) viii. 101, 4 = Av. x. 8, 3. 8) Cf. Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, 1, with 
Keith's note; Griffith, Hymns of the 
Rigveda, 2, 253. 9) In Rv. x. 72, 2, devānāṃ pūrvye 
yuge, ‘in the earlier age of the gods,’ 
occurs. 10) iii. 12, 9, 2. Cf. Muir, 12, 42, 
n. 66. 11) vii. 15, 4 (in the description of the 
merits of exertion): ‘A man while lying 
is the Kali; moving himself, he is the 
Dvāpara; rising, he is the Tretā; 
walking, he becomes the Kṛta’ (Kaliḥ 
śayāno bhavati saṃjihānas tu Dvāparaḥ | 
uttiṣṭhaṃs Tretā bhavati, Kṛtaṃ saṃpad- 
yate caran||). 12) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 2, 464, criti
cized by Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 319. 13) Indische Studien, 1, 286; 9, 315

Māra, 151. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 367
371; Weber, Indische Streifen, 1, 91. 
A quite different theory of the Yugas 
is given by Shamasastry, Gavām Ayana, 
141 et seq., but his whole theory is quite 
impossible. Weber once (Indian Litera- 
ture, 113, n. 127) found the mention of 
the quinquennial Yuga in Rv. iii. 55, 
18, but that passage refers to the five 
or six seasons (see Griffith, Hymns of 
the Rigveda, 1, 382, n.), while i. 25, 8, 
merely alludes to the intercalary month. 
Weber also (op. cit., 70, 247) considers 
that the Yugas are derived from the 
phases of the moon, but this idea was 
long since disposed of by Roth, Die 
Lehre von den vier Weltaltern (Tübingen, 
1860).

युद्ध
युद्ध
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘battle.’ The 
more usual word earlier
	3 is Yudh. 1) x. 54, 2. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 9, 1; 
Aitareva Brāhmaṇa, iii. 39, 1. 2;

युधांश्रौष्टिऔग्रसैन्य
युधां-श्रौष्टि औग्र-सैन्य
 (‘descendant of Ugrasena’) 
is the name, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 of a king who was 
anointed by Parvata and Nārada. 1) viii. 21, 7. Cf. Weber, Episches im vedischen Ritual, 8. The Paurāṇic form is 
Yuddha-muṣṭi.

युध्यामधि
युध्यामधि
 is apparently the name of a king who was 
defeated by Sudās. The mention of him occurring only in the 
verses added at the end of the hymn celebrating the victory of 
Sudās over the ten kings
	1 can claim little authenticity as a 
notice of Sudās. 1) Rv. vii. 18, 24. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173.

युवति
युवति
 is the ordinary expression for a ‘young woman’ or 
‘maiden’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.

यूप
यूप
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 means a ‘post,’ usually that 
to which the sacrificial victim was tied. It also designates the 
post to which the door of the house was attached (Durya).
	3 1) v. 2, 7 (of Sunaḥśepa). 2) Av. ix. 6, 22; xii. 1, 38; xiii. 1, 47;

etc. 3) Rv. i. 51, 14. Cf. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 153.

यूषन्
यूषन्,
 occurring in the description of the horse-sacrifice in 
the Rigveda
	1 and the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	2 denotes the ‘broth’ 
which was made from the flesh of the sacrificial animal, and 
was no doubt used as food. Vessels employed for holding it, 
Pātra and Āsecana, are mentioned. Another form of the word, 
found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	3 is Yūs, which corresponds to 
the Latin jus. 1) i. 162, 13. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 11, 1. 4; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 9. 3) vi. 3, 11, 1. 4. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271; 
Schrader, Prehisteric Antiquities, 316.

येवाष
येवाष
 is the name of a destructive insect in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
The form Yavāṣa is found in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	2 Cf. Vṛṣa. 1) v. 23, 7. 8. 2) xxx. 1 (Indische Studien, 3, 462). 
The same form occurs in the Gaṇas, 
kumudādi and prekṣādi (Pāṇini, iv. 2, 
80). Cf. Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 1, 
where Yavāṣa should be read; Kapi

योक्त्र
योक्त्र
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes the ‘thongs’ used 
for yoking the chariot or cart. 1) iii. 33, 13 v. 33, 2. 2) Av. iii. 30 6; vii. 78, 1; Taittirīya

maṇa, iii. 3, 3, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 3, 1, 13; vi. 4, 3, 7, etc.

योग
योग
 denotes the yoke of oxen or horses drawing a car in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	2 1) vi. 91, 1 (yokes of six or eight); 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 2, etc. Cf. Sīra. 2) iv. 3, 11 (ratha-yogāḥ, ‘chariot 
teams’).

योजन
योजन
 occurs frequently in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 as a 
measure of distance,
	3 but there is no reference defining its real 
length. Later it is reckoned at four Krośas, or about nine 
miles.
	4 1) i. 123, 8; ii. 16, 3; x. 78, 7; 86, 20, 
etc. 2) Av. iv. 26, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
ii. 9, 9; iii. 8, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 4, 2, 7, etc. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 363, who finds in Rv. i. 123, 8, 
yojana as a division of time equivalent 
to the Muhūrta. But this is most 
improbable. 3) That is, the distance driven in 
one ‘harnessing’ (without unyoking), 
a ‘stage.’ 4) Sometimes calculated at 8 krośas, or 18 miles. The estimate of 2(1/2) miles 
is also found.

योध
योध
 in the Rigveda
	1 means ‘fighter,’ ‘warrior,’ ‘soldier.’ 1) i. 143, 5; iii. 39, 4; vi. 25, 5; x. 78, 3.

योषन्
योषन्, योषणा, योषा, योषित्
 all denote ‘young woman,’ 
‘maiden,’ as an object of affection, and as meet for wedlock.
	1 
So these terms are often opposed in the Brāhmaṇas to Vṛṣan, 
‘male,’ in the general sense of ‘female,’
	2 but they also occur in 
the sense of ‘wife,’
	3 or ‘daughter,’
	4 or merely ‘girl.’
	5 See Strī. 1) Yoṣan, Rv. iv. 5, 5; Yoṣaṇā, iii. 52, 3;

यौगं-धरि,
 ‘descendant of Yugaṃdhara,’ is the name of 
a king of the Sālvas in the Mantrapāṭha (ii. 11, 12).

यौवन
यौवन,
 ‘youth,’ is found in the Atharvaveda (xviii. 4, 50), 
where it is opposed to ‘old age.’

रक्षितृ
रक्षितृ,
 ‘protector,’ ‘guardian,’ occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later,
	2 usually in a metaphorical sense. 1) i. 89, 1. 5; ii. 39, 6; guardian of 
Soma, vi. 7, 7; of the dogs of Yama, 
x. 14, 11, etc. 2) Av. iii. 27, 1; xii. 3, 55; xix. 15, 3; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 5, etc.

रघट्
रघट्
 occurs once in the plural in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where 
the Paippalāda recension reads vaghaṭah. Roth
	2 once con 
jectured raghavaḥ, ‘swift,’ as the correct reading. Bloomfield,
	3 
who in his translation explains the word as ‘falcons,’ in his 
notes inclines to think Roth's conjecture likely. Ludwig
	4 
suggests ‘bees’ as the meaning. Possibly some kind of bird 
may be intended.

 as an adjective with Hiraṇya
	1 designates ‘silver,’ and 
ornaments (Rukma),
	2 dishes (Pātra),
	3 and coins (Niṣka)
	4 ‘made

substantive to denote ‘silver.’

रजनकोणेय
रजन कोणेय,
 or Kauṇeya, is the name of a teacher 
mentioned in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 It is said in the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	2 that Kratujit Jānaki successfully sacrificed 
for him when he desired to obtain eyesight. He is also 
mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	3 where the name of 
his son, Ugradeva Rājani, also occurs.

tions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts 
and Sciences, 15, 58, n. 2. 4) He was a leper, and the Rajanī is 
used against leprosy, Bloomfield, Hymns 
of the Atharvaveda, 266.

रजनी
रजनी
 is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it 
denotes some sort of plant, probably so called because of its 
power of ‘colouring’ (from rañj, ‘to colour’). The species 
cannot be identified owing to the untrustworthiness of the later 
authorities who attempt its identification. 1) i. 23, 1. Cf. Roth in Whitney's 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 24; 
Bloomfield, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 
267.

रजयित्री
रजयित्री,
 a ‘female dyer,’ is included in the list of victims at 
the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1.

रजस्
1. Rajas denotes the region of the atmosphere between 
heaven and earth in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 The atmosphere, 
like the sky (Div), is divided into three regions,
	3 but more 
normally into two, the ‘earthly’ (pārthiva)
	4 and the ‘heavenly’ 
(divya or divaḥ).
	5 In some passages
	6 the word refers in the 
plural to the dusty fields on earth. 1) i. 56, 5; 62, 5; 84, 1; 124, 5; 168, 6;

रजस्
2. Rajas in one passage of the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 clearly 
means ‘silver,’ like Rajata. It is also taken in this sense in 
one passage of the Rigveda
	2 by Zimmer,
	3 but this interpretation 
is doubtful. 1) Rajaḥ-śaya, Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,

रजस
रजस
 occurs once in the Atharvaveda,

or perhaps demon, slain by Indra for Piṭhīnas. 1) vi. 26, 6. Cf. Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 156; St. Petersburg

 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (vi. 7, 1, 28) den 
‘cord’ or ‘rope.’

रज्जु
रज्जु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘rope.’ In the 
Atharvaveda
	3 the serpent is called the ‘toothed rope’ (rajju 
datvatī). 1) i. 162, 8 (śīrṣaṇyā raśanā rajjuḥ, 
referring to the horse presumably means 
the head harness). 2) Av. iii. 11, 8; vi. 121, 2; Taittirīya

रत्न
रत्न
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a precious object, 
not specifically a ‘jewel,’ as in post-Vedic literature. 1) i. 20, 7; 35, 8; 41, 6; 125, 1; 
140, 11; 141, 10; ii. 38, 1, etc. 2) Av. v. 1, 7; vii. 14, 4; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 1, 1.

रत्नि
रत्नि,
 ‘ell,’ occurring in the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (iv. 4) is a 
corruption of Aratni.

रत्निन्
रत्निन्,
 ‘receiving gifts,’ is the term applied to those people 
of the royal entourage in whose houses the Ratna-havis, a 
special rite, was performed in the course of the Rājasūya or 
‘royal consecration.’ The list given in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 consists of the Brahman (i.e., 
the Purohita), the Rājanya, the Mahiṣī (the first wife of the 
king), the Vāvāta (the favourite wife of the king), the Parivṛktī 
(the discarded wife), the Senānī, ‘commander of the army’; the 
Sūta, ‘charioteer’; the Grāmaṇī, ‘village headman’; the 
Kṣattṛ, ‘chamberlain’; the Saṃgrahītṛ, ‘charioteer’ or 
‘treasurer’; the Bhāgadugha, ‘collector of taxes’ or ‘divider 
of food’; and the Akṣāvāpa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or 
‘thrower of dice.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 the order is 
Senānī; Purohita; Mahisī; Sūta; Grāmaṇī; Kṣattṛ; Saṃ
grahitṛ; Bhāgadugha; Akṣāvāpa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of 
cows’ or ‘huntsman’; and Pālāgala, ‘courier’; the ‘discarded 
wife’ being mentioned as forbidden to stay at home
	4 on the 
day of the ceremony of offering a pap for Nirṛti in her house. 
In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	5 the list is Brahman (i.e., Puro
hita); Rājan; Mahiṣī; Parivṛktī; Senānī; Saṃgrahītṛ; Kṣattṛ; 
Sūta; Vaiśyagrāmaṇī; Bhāgadugha; Takṣa-Rathakārau, ‘car
penter and chariot-maker’; Akṣāvāpa; and Go-vikarta. The 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	6 substitutes Go-vyacha for Govikarta, and 
omits Takṣa-Rathakārau. 
It will be seen that the list is essentially that of the royal 
household, and of the king's servants in the administration of 
the country, though the exact sense of Saṃgrahītṛ, Bhāga- 
dugha, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, is open to reasonable doubt, 
mainly as to whether public officers or private servants
	7 are 
meant, for the names are of uncertain significance. A briefer 
list of eight Vīras, ‘heroes,’ as among the friends of the king, 
is given in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa:
	8 brother, son, Purohita, 
Mahiṣī, Sūta, Grāmaṇī, Kṣattṛ, and Saṃgrahītṛ. 1) i. 8, 9, 1 et seq. 2) i. 7, 3, 1 et seq. 3) v. 3, 1, 1 et seq. 4) According to Kātyāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, xv. 3, 35, she goes to a Brahmin's 
house, where she shares his inviolability 
and exemption from jurisdiction. 5) ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8. 6) xv. 4. 7) Similarly Akṣāvāpa is either the 
man who dices for the king — i.e., a 
professional dicer who plays with the 
king or watches his play — or a public 
officer who superintends the gambling 
halls of the state and collects the 
revenue, as was regularly done later on. 
Early English history shows similar 
evolution of household officers into 
ministers of state. 8) xix. 1, 4.

रथ
रथ
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘chariot’ as 
opposed to Anas, ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute. 
Of differences in the structure of the two we have no informa
tion, except that the Kha, or nave hole, in the wheel of the 
chariot was greater than in that of the cart.
	3 
The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels (Cakra), to which 
reference is frequently made.
	4 The wheel consisted of a rim 
(Pavi), a felly (Pradhi), spokes (Ara),
	5 and a nave (Nabhya). 
The rim and the felly together constitute the Nemi. The hole 
in the nave is called Kha: into it the end of the axle was 
inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether Āṇi denotes 
the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the 
lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes 
a solid wheel was used.
	6 
The axle (Akṣa) was, in some cases, made of Araṭu wood;
	7 
round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached 
the body of the chariot (Kośa). This part is also denoted by 
the word Vandhura, which more precisely means the ‘seat’ 
of the chariot. The epithet tri-vandhura is used of the chariot 
of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its 
epithets, tri-cakra: perhaps, as Weber
	8 thinks, a chariot with 
three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but 
Zimmer
	9 considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. Garta 
also denotes the seat of the warrior. 
At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot (Īṣā, 
Praüga). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either 
side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke (Yuga) being 
laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole 
in the yoke (called Kha
	10 or Tardman),
	11 the yoke and the pole 
then being tied together.
	12 
The horses were tied by the neck (grīvā), where the yoke was 
placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened 
to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the 
ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably 
should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to 
a point at the tip.
	13 The traces seem to be denoted by Raśmi 
and Raśanā. These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were 
fastened to the bit (perhaps śiprā) in the horse's mouth. The 
driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with 
a whip (Kaśā).
	14 The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā.
	15 
The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but 
three or four
	16 were often used. It is uncertain whether, in 
these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the 
side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could 
be employed.
	17 Horses were normally used for chariots, but 
the ass (gardabha)
	18 or mule (aśvatarī)
	19 are also mentioned. 
The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its 
name, Anaḍvāh, from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to 
be content with a single steed, which then ran between two 
shafts.
	20 
In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the 
warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, Savyeṣṭha or 
Savyaṣṭhā,
	21 He could also sit when he wanted, for the 
chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit 
while shooting his arrows. 
The dimensions of the chariot are given in the Śulba Sūtra
	22 
of Āpastamba at 188 Aṅgulis (finger-breadths) for the pole, 
104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in 
its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel.
	23 
Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names 
being often obscure in meaning: see Aṅka, Nyaṅka, Uddhi, 
Pakṣas, Pātalya, Bhurij, Rathopastha, Rathavāhana. 1) i. 20, 3; iii. 15, 5; iv. 4, 10; 16,

Ethnologie 5, 200. Cf. note 21. 9) Op. cit. iii. 10) This seems to be the sense of 
Rv. viii. 91, 7; but it has also been 
taken as the opening in the yoke 
through which the ox's head passed 
(the Homeric ). See Cowell's 
note on Wilson's translation; Griffith, 
Hymns of the Rigveda, 2, 237, n. 11) Av. xiv. 1, 40. 12) Rv. iii. 6, 6; v. 56, 4; x. 60, 8. 13) Zimmer, op. cit., 249, thinks that 
vāṇī in Rv. i. 119, 5, denotes the two 
bars of wood to which the traces were 
fastened. This is also the view of Roth, 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., Böht
lingk's Lexicon, and Grassmann. The 
word may mean ‘two voices’ (Griffith, 
Hymns of the Rigveda, 1, 162). 14) Rv. v. 83, 3; vi. 75, 6. 15) Rv. x. 10, 13; kakṣya-prā, ‘filling 
out the girths’ (i.e., ‘well fed’), is an 
epithet of Indra's horses, i. 10, 3. 16) Three horses are mentioned in 
Rv. x. 33, 5, and Praṣṭi in Rv. i. 39, 6; 
viii. 7, 28, etc., may have the sense of 
‘third horse.’ See also Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, v. 1, 4, 11; 2, 4, 9, etc.; Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12. For four 
horses, cf. Rv. ii. 18, 1; Śatapatha

19; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 12;

with Savyaṣṭhā, and in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, i. 7, 9, 1, savyeṣṭha-sārathi 
occurs as a compound where the sense 
is certainly ‘the warrior and the 
charioteer.’ See also Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, v. 3, 1, 8, and Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 41, 62, n. 1. The 
Greek notices speak of two warriors 
and a charioteer. Cf. the Aśvins' car 
with its three seats. See von Schroeder, 
Indiens Literatur und Cultur, 435. 22) vi. 5 (Bürk, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 56, 344,

रथकार
रथ-कार,
 ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharva
veda
	1 as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming 
to stand generally as an example of the industrial population. 
He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	2 and in the 
Brāhmaṇas:
	3 in all these passages, as well a probably in the 
Atharvaveda also, the Rathakāra already forms a caste. The 
later system
	4 regards the Rathakāra as the offspring of a 
Māhiṣya (the son of a Kṣatriya husband and a Vaiśya wife) and 
a Karaṇī (the daughter of a Vaiśya husband and a Śūdra wife), 
but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is 
historically accurate. The Rathakāras must rather be deemed 
to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt
	5 suggests that 
the Anu tribe formed the basis of the Rathakāra caste, referring 
to their worship of the Ṛbhus, who are, of course, the chariot
makers par excellence. But there is little ground for this view. 1) iii. 5, 6. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 13; Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 5; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xvi. 17; xxx. 6. 3) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 4, 8; 
iii. 4, 2, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 
2, 17. 4) Yājñavalkya, i. 95. On the special 
position, in the later ritual, of the 
Rathakāra as a caste below the Vaiśya, 
but superior to the Śūdra, cf. Weber, 
Indische Studien, 10, 12, 13, and cf. 
Varṇa, see also Fick, Die sociale Glie- 
derung, 209, 210. 5) Vedische Mythologie, 3, 152, 153.

रथगृत्स
रथ-गृत्स
 in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā (xv. 15) and the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 48, 9) denotes a ‘skilled charioteer.’

kṛtsa, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 9.

रथचक्र
रथ-चक्र,
 ‘chariot wheel,’ is often mentioned in the 
Brāhmaṇas.
	1 See Ratha and Cakra. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 43, 4;

xi. 8, 1, 11, etc.

रथचर्षण
रथ-चर्षण
 occurs once in the Rigveda,
	1 where the sense 
is doubtful. Roth
	2 thought that some part of the chariot was 
meant, but the sense is perhaps only the ‘pathway of the 
chariot.’
	3 1) viii. 5, 19. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Cf. also the citation and explana
tion in Durga's commentary on the 
Nirukta, v. 12.

रथजूति
रथ-जूति
 in the Atharvaveda (xix. 44, 3) is either an adjec
tive meaning ‘driving swiftly in a chariot,’
	1 or a proper name, 
as Roth in the St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests. 1) ‘Of chariot-swiftness’ according 
to Whitney, Translation of the Athar 
vaveda, 967. Cf. his note on the 
passage.

रथनाभि
रथ-नाभि,
 the ‘nave of the chariot-wheel,’ is mentioned 
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 and in the Upaniṣads.

रथप्रोतदार्भ्य
रथ-प्रोत दार्भ्य
 (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned 
in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 3) perhaps as a king, but 
possibly as a priest.

रथप्रोष्ठ
रथ-प्रोष्ठ
 occurs as the name of a princely family in 
the Rigveda (x. 60, 5). See Subandhu.

रथमुख
रथ-मुख
 in the later Saṃhitās
	1 denotes the fore-part of 
a chariot. Cf. Rathaśīrṣa. 1) Av. viii. 8, 23; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 3, 2; v. 4, 9, 3, etc.

रथर्वी
रथर्वी
 is the name of a snake in the Atharvaveda (x. 4, 5).

रथवाहन
रथ-वाहन
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 for a 
movable stand to hold the chariot. According to Roth,
	3 it 
corresponds to the Greek , on which the chariot rested 
when out of use. The word Rathavāhana-vāha is employed in 
the sense of the two horses that draw the stand.
	4 Weber
	5 thinks 
it was used to convey the war chariot to the scene of action. 1) vi. 75, 8. 2) Av. iii. 17, 3 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

ii. 2, 1. 5) Über den Vājapeya, 27, n. 2, followed 
by Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 275. 
Weber, however, admits that the Ratha
vāhana may at times have served as a 
mere stand, like the Homeric  
while Geldner expresses the opinion 
that it never has that sense. The use 
of the term Rathavāhanavāha shows 
that the stand was movable.

रथवीतिदार्भ्य
रथवीति दार्भ्य
 (‘descendant of Darbha’) is mentioned 
once in the Rigveda
	1 as residing in places abounding in kine 
(gomatīr anu) far away among the hills, possibly the Himālayas, 
and as the patron of the singer of the hymn. Later the tradition
	2 
makes him the king, whose daughter Śyāsvāśva won for his 
wife by his father's and the Maruts' aid. 1) v. 61, 17. 19. 2) See Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda,

	1 denotes the ‘axle of 
the chariot.’ Its length is given by the scholiast on the Kātyā

agrees with the statement in the Āpastamba Śulba Sūtra.

 (‘good charioteer’) is the name of a teacher 
mentioned in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	1 and the Bṛhad
devatā.

 ‘standing on the chariot,’ denotes in the Rig
veda
	1 the warrior who fights from the chariot, ‘car-fighter.’ 1) i. 173, 4. 5; ii. 17, 3; vi. 21, 1;

रथोपस्थ
रथोपस्थ,
 ‘lap of the chariot,’ in the Atharvaveda
	1 and 
the Brāhmaṇas
	2 seems to denote the ‘bottom’ or lower part on 
which the driver and the fighter stand. 1) viii. 8, 23. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 10, 2; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 3, 12, etc.

रन्ध्र
रन्ध्र
 seems, in the phrase Ukṣṇo Randhra occurring in 
one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 7, 26), to be the name of a 
place, but the sense is very doubtful. In the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 9, 13) Ukṣṇo randhra is the name of a man.

रभि
रभि,
 occurring once in the Rigveda (viii. 5, 29), designates 
some part of the chariot. The term perhaps means ‘supporting 
shaft.’

रम्भ
रम्भ
 seems to mean a ‘staff’ or ‘support’ in one passage 
of the Rigveda (viii. 45, 20). In another place (ii. 15, 9) a man 
is described as Rambhin, apparently as carrying a staff to 
support himself in old age; Sāyaṇa explains this word as 
‘door-keeper’ (like one of the senses of daṇḍin, ‘staff-bearer,’ 
in later Sanskrit).

रम्भिणी
रम्भिणी
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 as being on 
the shoulders of the Maruts. A ‘spear’ seems to be meant, 
perhaps conceived as clinging (rambh = rabk, ‘clasp’) to the 
shoulders of a man. 1) i. 168, 3. Cf. i. 167, 3, and see Max Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 283.

रयि
रयि
 is the common word for ‘wealth’ in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 Special mention is often made of wealth in ‘heroes’ 
(vīra) — i.e., in ‘good sons,’
	3 in horses,
	4 in cattle,
	5 etc. 1) i. 73, 1; 159, 4; ii. 21, 6; iii. 1,

रशना
रशना
 means generally ‘cord’ or ‘rope.’ In the Rigveda 
the word ofter refers to various fastenings of a horse. In one 
passage
	1 the expression śīrṣaṇyā raśanā, ‘head rope,’ perhaps 
means not so much ‘reins’ as ‘headstall.’ In others
	2 the 
sense of ‘traces’ seems certain, though sometimes
	3 ‘reins’ or 
‘traces’ may equally well be intended. Elsewhere the more 
general sense of ‘rope’ for fastening is meant.
	4 1) i. 162, 8. Cf. Rajju. 2) Rv. i. 163, 2. 5; x. 79, 7. 3) Rv. iv. 1. 9; ix. 87, 1; x. 18, 14. 
Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 4, 3. 4) Rv. ii. 28, 5; Av. viii. 78, 1; x. 9, 2; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 46; xxii. 2; 
xxviii. 33; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 6. 
4, 3; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 3. 
10, etc. Cf. the use of Raśanā as 
equivalent to ‘finger’ in Rv. x. 4, 6. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249.

रश्मि
1. Raśmi is not rarely found in the sense of ‘rope’
	1 
generally; but more usually it denotes either the ‘reins’ or 
the ‘traces’
	2 of a chariot, either sense being equally good in 
most passages. 1) Rv. i. 28, 4; iv. 22, 8; viii. 25, 18, 
etc.; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 19, 3, etc. 2) Rv. viii. 7, 8; x. 130, 7, etc.;

Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 4, 2, etc. In Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, ii. 37, 1, the two inner 
(antarau) reins or traces of the chariot 
are mentioned. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 249.

रश्मि
2. Raśmi in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 regularly denotes a 
‘ray’ of the sun. 1) i. 35, 7; iv. 52, 7; vii. 36, 1; 77, 3, 
etc. 2) Av. ii. 32, 1; xii. 1, 15; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1, 1, 1; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 3, 14, etc.

रसा
रसा
 is found in three passages of the Rigveda,
	1 clearly as the 
name of a real stream in the extreme north-west of the Vedic 
territory. Elsewhere
	2 it is the name of a mythic stream at 
the ends of the earth, which as well as the atmosphere it 
encompasses. It is reasonable to assume that, as in the case of 
the Sarasvatī, the literal is the older sense, and to see in the 
river a genuine stream, perhaps originally the Araxes or 
Jaxartes, because the Vendidad mentions the Raṅhā, the 
Avestan form of Rasā. But the word seems originally to allude 
merely to the ‘sap’ or ‘flavour’ of the waters,
	3 and so could be 
applied to every river, like Sarasvatī. 1) i. 112, 12; v. 53, 9; x. 75, 6. In 
v. 53, 9, the phrase rasānitabhā is found. 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
202, is inclined to regard anitabhā as an 
epithet of Rasā, perhaps for amitabhā, 
‘of unmeasured splendour,’ but this is 
hardly probable. It seems better to 
take Anitabhā as the name of an other
wise unknown river. Cf. Max Müller, 
India, 166, 173, n. 2) Rv. v. 41, 15; ix. 41, 6; x. 100, 
1, 2 (cf. Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 348; 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
19, 100 et seq.); 121, 4. 3) Rv. iv. 43, 6; viii. 72, 13.

16; Max Müller, Sacred Books of the 
East, 32, 323; Brunnhofer, Iran und 
Turan, 86; Weber, Proceedings of the 
Berlin Academy, 1898, 567-569.

रसाशिर्
रसाशिर्
 as an epithet of Soma in the Rigveda
	1 means ‘mixed 
with juice’ — i.e., with milk. 1) iii. 48, 1, where Sāyaṇa explains rasa as ‘milk.’ Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 1, 211, n. 5.

रहसू
रह-सू,
 ‘bearing in secret,’ is a term applied in one passage 
of the Rigveda (ii. 29, 1) to an unmarried mother. Cf. Pati 
and Dharma.

रहस्युदेवमलिम्लुच्
रहस्यु देव-मलिम्लुच्
 is the name, in the Pañcavimśa 
Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 4, 7), of a mythical person who at Munimaraṇa 
slew the saintly Vaikhānases.

रहूगण
रहू-गण
 is the name of a family mentioned in the plural 
in one passage of the Rigveda.
	1 According to Ludwig,
	2 they 
were connected with the Gotamas, as is shown by the name 
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa. 1) i. 78, 5. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 110. 
Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen, 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 236, n. 1.

राका
राका
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes the full moon day 
as a personification. Cf. Candramās. 1) ii. 32, 4; v. 42, 12. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 8, 1; iii. 4, 
9, 1. 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xii. 8; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 37, 2, 6; 47, 4, 
etc.; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 13, 1. 
etc.

राजकर्तृ
राज-कर्तृ,
 
	1 or Rāja-kṛt,
	2 ‘king-maker,’ is the term applied 
in the Atharvaveda and the Brāhmaṇas to those who, ‘not 
themselves kings,’
	3 aid in the consecration of the king. In the 
Śatapatha
	2 the persons meant and specified are the Sūta, 
‘charioteer,’ and the Grāmaṇī, ‘village chief,’ probably a repre
sentative chief from the village nearest to the place of consecra
tion, as Eggeling
	4 suggests. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 
according to the commentator's explanation, the father, 
brother, etc., are meant; in the Atharvaveda,
	2 also, the 
meaning of the expression is not stated in the text. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 17, 5. 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. 3) Loc. cit. 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18. 4) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 60, n. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 199 
et seq. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 17. 5. 2) Av. iii. 5, 7; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
iii. 4, 1, 7; xiii. 2, 2, 18.

राजकुल
राज-कुल,
 a ‘kingly family,’ is mentioned in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 28, 4), where, it is to be noted, such a 
family is ranked after, not before, a Brāhmaṇa Kula, a ‘Brah
min family.’

राजन्
1. Rājan, ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rig
veda
	1 and the later literature.
	2 It is quite clear that the 
normal, though not universal form of government, in early 
India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the 
fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory: 
a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of 
Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost 
necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the 
constitution.
	3 The mere patriarchal organization of society 
is not sufficient, as Zimmer
	4 assumes, to explain the Vedic 
kingship. 
Tenure of Monarchy. — Zimmer
	5 is of opinion that while the 
Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown 
by several cases where the descent can be traced,
	6 yet in others 
the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the 
selection by the people was between the members of the royal 
family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It 
must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective 
monarchy is not strong. As Geldner
	7 argues, all the passages 
cited
	8 can be regarded not as choice by the cantons (Viś), but 
as acceptance by the subjects (viś): this seems the more prob
able sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was 
not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member 
of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is 
exemplified by the legend in Yāska
	9 of the Kuru brothers, 
Devāpi and Śantanu, the value of which, as evidence of 
contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend 
itself being of dubious character and validity. 
Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references 
to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to 
recover their sovereignty,
	10 and the Atharvaveda contains spells 
in the interest of royalty.
	11 
The King in War. — Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rig
veda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no 
doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal 
functions. But the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	12 contains the state
ment that the Kuru-Pañcāla kings, who, like the Brahmins of 
those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to 
make their raids in the dewy season. The word Udāja, too, 
with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the 
booty of war. The Rigveda
	13 has many references to Vedic 
wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on 
fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and 
their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence 
was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector 
of the tribe’ (gopā janasya), or, as is said in the Rājasūya 
(‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’
	14 His 
Purohita was expected to use his spells and charms to secure 
the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in 
person: so Pratardana met death in war according to the 
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;
	15 and in the Rājasūya the king is invoked 
as ‘sacker of cities’ (purāṃ bhettā). 
The King in Peace. — In return for his warlike services the 
king received the obedience
	16 — sometimes forced
	17 — of the 
people, and in particular their contributions for the mainten
ance of royalty. The king is regularly
	18 regarded as ‘devouring 
the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that 
he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a 
custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the 
people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also 
probable that the king could assign the royal right of mainten
ance to a Kṣatriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the 
people. Taxation would not normally fall on Kṣatriya or 
Brahmin; the texts contain emphatic assertions of the exemp
tion of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty.
	19In 
the people, however, lay the strength of the king.
	20 See also 
Bali. 
In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself 
immune from punishment (a-daṇḍya), he wields the rod of 
punishment (Daṇḍa).
	21 It is probable that criminal justice 
remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras
	22 
preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal 
jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a 
royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Rājanya is mentioned 
as an overseer (adhyakṣa) of the punishment of a Śūdra in the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	23 In civil justice it may be that the king 
played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final 
appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The Madhyamaśī 
of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private 
judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, how
ever, to some extent supported
	24 by the frequent mention of 
Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the 
human king.
	25 Possibly such spies could be used in war 
also.
	26 
There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise 
of legislative activity by the king, though later it is an essential 
part of his duties.
	27 Nor can we say exactly what executive 
functions devolved on the king. 
In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his Puro- 
hita; he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal 
ministers and attendants (see Ratnin). The local administra
tion was entrusted to the Grāmaṇī, or village chief, who may 
have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs 
of the king's rank were his palace
	28 and his brilliant dress.
	29 
The King as Landowner. — The position of the king with 
regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices,
	30 
in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust, 
since they were collected by observers who were probably little 
used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose 
statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their 
statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare 
that only the king and no private person could own land, while 
in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins
	31 is strongly 
of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection 
-i.e., in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was 
recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual 
or the joint family also owned the land. As against Baden
Powell,
	32 who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner 
was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we 
have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that, 
according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	33 the Vaiśya can be 
devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the Śūdra, not 
killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he 
cites Bṛhaspati and Nārada as clearly recognizing the king's 
overlordship, besides a passage of the Mānava Dharma Śāstra
	34 
which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which 
Bühler
	35 was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning. 
The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought. 
It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely con
ceived — as the English king still is — as lord of all the land in a 
proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea 
was only a gradual development than that it was primitive. 
The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a 
right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in 
South Africa,
	36 where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of 
his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The 
matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the 
parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the 
political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way 
of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins
	37 thinks 
that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first 
sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift 
of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily 
also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are 
hardly decisive one way or the other. 
For the relations of the king with the assembly, see Sabhā; 
for his consecration, see Rājasūya. A-rāja-tā, ‘lack of a king,’ 
means ‘anarchy.’

In the Rājasūya the protection of the

kine (goṣu) of Av. iv. 22, 2, is to be 
referred. It is significant that the 
village and cattle are put on the same

ment that the king was supreme land
owner. See n. 31 below. For the rate

Brāhmaṇa, vii. 31, he is likened to the 
Nyagrodha tree. 30) See Diodorus, ii. 40; Arrian,

Anglo-Saxon times (English Historical 
Review, viii. 1-7). nor in Homeric 
Greece (Lang, Homer and His Age, 236

राजन्
2. Rājan in several passages-means no more than a ‘noble of 
the ruling house,’ or perhaps even merely a ‘noble,’ there being 
1 Cf. Rv. i. 40, 8; 108, 7; x. 42, 10; 
97, 6; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 6, 8, 3; 
v. 7, 6, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xl. 13; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 48; xxvi. 2; 
Av. xix. 62, 1, and possibly ii. 6, 4, etc.; 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
236, 237. Possibly rājñaḥ in Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 5, may be 
taken in this sense. The king there is 
said to be a non-Āryan, but the reading 
is corrupt, and Oertel's conjecture is 
not probable. Cf. Rājya, n. 2. 
no decisive passage. Zimmer
	2 sees traces in one passage of 
the Rigveda
	3 that in times of peace there was no king in some 
states, the members of the royal family holding equal rights. 
He compares this with the state of affairs in early Germany.
	4 
But the passage merely shows that the nobles could be called 
Rājan, and is not decisive for the sense ascribed to it by 
Zimmer. Of course this state of affairs is perfectly possible, 
and is exemplified later in Buddhist times.
	5 2) Altindisches Leben, 176, 177. 3) x. 97, 6. He also compares Av. 
i. 9; iii. 4; iv. 22, where the king is 
referred to as superior to the other 
royal personages. 4) The case of the Cherusci and 
Arminius' attempt to make himself 
king, which his relatives, the royal 
family, foiled (see Tacitus, Annals, ii. 
88). 5) Cf. Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 
19.

राजनि
राजनि,
 ‘descendant of Rajana,’ is the patronymic of Ugra- 
deva in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 3, 17; xxiii. 16, 11) 
and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (v. 4. 12).

राजन्य
राजन्य
 is the regular term in Vedic literature
	1 for a man of 
the royal family, probably including also those who were not 
actually members of that family, but were nobles, though it 
may have been originally restricted to members of the royal 
family. This, however, does not appear clearly from any 
passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles 
irrespective of kingly power. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 
the Rājanya is different from the Rājaputra, who is literally a 
son of the king. The functions and place of the Rājanya are 
described under Kṣatriya, which expression later normally 
takes the place of Rājanya as a designation for the ruling class. 
His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā
	3 he is ranked with the learned Brahmin and the 
Grāmaṇī (who was a Vaiśya) as having reached the height of 
prosperity (gata-śrī). 1) Only once in the Rv. in the late 
Puruṣa-sūkta, x. 90, 12; but often in 
the Av.: v. 17, 9; 18, 2; vi. 38, 4; 
x. 10, 18; xii. 4, 32 et seq.; xv. 8, 1; 
xix. 32, 8; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 
13, 1; 5, 4, 4; 10, 1; v. 1, 10, 3, etc. 
Even in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
where, on the whole, the later use of 
Kṣatriya prevails, the Rājanya is often 
mentioned. See Eggeling's index, Sacred 
Books of the East, 44, 561. 2) Cf. xiii. 4, 2, 17, with xiii. 1, 6, 2. 3) ii. 5, 4, 4. 
Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 258 
et seq.; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
191. It is quite likely that the noble 
families not related to the royal family 
were families of minor princes whose 
rule was merged in that of the king 
on the formation of a powerful tribe, 
as was the case in Germany.

राजन्यबन्धु
राजन्य-बन्धु
 denotes a Rājanya, but usually with a 
depreciating sense. Thus in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 Janaka 
is called by the Brahmins, whom he defeated in disputation, ‘a 
fellow of a Rājanya’; the same description is applied to Pravāh- 
aṇa Jaivali in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	2 for a similar 
reason. On the other hand, in one passage
	3 where reference is 
made to men eating apart from women, princes are said to do 
so most of all: the term Rājanyabandhu cannot here be 
deemed to be contemptuous, unless, indeed, it is the expression 
of Brahmin contempt for princes, such as clearly appears in 
the treatment of Nagnajit in another passage.
	4 Again, in a 
passage
	5 in which the four castes are mentioned, the Vaiśya 
precedes the Rājanyabandhu, a curious inversion of the order 
of the second and third castes.
	6 1) xi. 6, 2, 5. 2) vi. 1, 5. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 5, 2. 10, 
where cf. Eggeling's note, Sacred 
Books of the East, 43, 370, n. 1. A 
similar case is apparently i. 2, 4, 2, 
where any special contempt cannot be 
meant. 4) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 12, 515. 5) i. 1, 4, 12. 6) Eggeling, op. cit., 12, 28.

राजन्यर्षि
राजन्य-र्षि,
 ‘royal sage,’ is a term applied to Sindhukṣit 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The story about him is, 
however, purely mythical. 1) xii. 12, 6. Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell- 
schaft, 42, 235, n. 3, and see Varṇa (p. 261).

राजपति
राज-पति,
 ‘lord of kings,’ is found in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa (xi. 4, 3, 9) as an epithet of Soma. It is not used 
elsewhere as a title of imperial temporal supremacy: see 
Rājya.

राजपितृ
राज-पितृ
 is one of the titles given to the king in the rite of 
the Rājasūya (‘royal consecration’) according to the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa (viii. 12, 5; 17, 5). It probably designates the king 
as ‘father of a king,’ and indicates the hereditary character of 
the monarchy. Possibly the later plan
	1 of associating the 
king's son in the monarchy prevailed in earlier times also. 1) Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 13, 139. The sense of ‘having 
a king as father’ is also possible.

राजपुत्र
राज-पुत्र,
 ‘king's son,’ ‘prince,’ seems to be capable of 
being interpreted literally in every passage of the older litera
ture
	1 in which it is found, though it may also be capable of a 
wider interpretation.
	2 Later the Rājaputra degenerates into a 
mere ‘landowner.’
	3 1) Rv. x. 40, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
vii. 17, 6 (of Viśvāmitra, but probably 
in a mythical sense); Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa, xix. 1, 4; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xiv. 8; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8, 5, 1; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 2, 5; 
5, 2, 5, etc. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 1, may 
be cited as identifying the Rājanya and 
the Rājaputra. 3) Jolly, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 50, 514, who points 
out that in the Rājataraṅgiṇī, vii. 360, 
traces of the older position of the Rāja
putra are seen.

राजपुरुष
राज-पुरुष
 denotes a ‘royal servant’ in the Nirukta (ii. 3). 
Cf. Pūruṣa.

राजभ्रातृ
राज-भ्रातृ,
 the ‘brother of the king,’ is mentioned as 
one of the eight Vīras, or supporters of the monarchy, in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 He is also alluded to elsewhere.
	2 1) xix. 1, 4. Cf. Hopkins, Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 30, n. 2. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 13, 18, etc.

राजमात्र
राज-मात्र
 is found in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxvii. 6) 
and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvii. 5, 3. 4; 15, 3), where 
it seems to include ‘the whole class of persons (who could be 
called) Rājan’ — i.e., the Rājaputras and the Rājanyas.

राजयक्ष्म
राज-यक्ष्म,
 ‘royal sickness,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
and several times later on.
	2 Zimmer
	3 identifies it with con
sumption: this identification seems certain, being supported by 
the later view of the disease.
	4 Bloomfield
	5 suggests ‘king's 
evil,’ or syphilis, as the sense, but this is not probable. 1) i. 161, 1. 2) Av. xi. 3, 39; xii. 5; Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 5, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xi. 3; xxvii. 3; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
ii. 2, 7. 3) Altindisches Leben, 375 et seq. 4) Cf. Wise, System of Hindu Medicine, 
321 et seq.; Jolly, Medicin, 88, 89, n. 2, 
who takes Rājayakṣma as denoting the 
worst of diseases, not the disease cured 
by the king. Cf. Rājāśva. 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 697. But 
contrast ibid., 415.

राजसूय
राज-सूय
 is the name in the Atharvaveda
	1 and the later 
literature
	2 of the ceremony of the ‘royal consecration.’ The 
rite is described at great length in the Sūtras,
	3 but its main 
features are clearly outlined in the Brāhmaṇas,
	4 while the 
verses used in the ceremony are preserved in the Saṃhitās of 
the Yajurveda.
	5 Besides much mere priestly elaboration, the 
ritual contains traces of popular ceremonial. For example, the 
king is clothed in the ceremonial garments of his rank, and 
provided with bow and arrow as emblems of sovereignty. He 
is formally anointed; he performs a mimic cow raid against a 
relative of his;
	6 or engages in a sham fight with a Rājanya.
	7 
A game of dice is played in which he is made to be the victim;
	8 
he symbolically ascends the quarters of the sky as an indication 
of his universal rule; and steps on a tiger skin, thus gaining 
the strength and the pre-eminence of the tiger. 
A list of the consecrated kings is given in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa,
	9 where the royal inauguration is called the ‘great 
unction’ (mahābhiṣeka) connected with Indra. It corresponds 
generally with a list of Aśvamedhins, ‘performers of the horse 
sacrifice,’ given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	10 and the Śāṅkhā
yana Śrauta Sūtra.
	11 1) iv. 8, 1; xi. 7, 7. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 2, 1; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15, 8; Sata
patha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 12, etc. 3) See Weber, Über die Königsweihe, den 
Rājasūya; Hillebrandt, Rituallitteratur, 
144-147; Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, 
472, 491. The relation of the Śunaḥ- 
śepa episode formed part of the ritual. 
That this points to human sacrifice 
having once formed part of the ritual 
of the Rājasūya as supposed by Hille
brandt, loc. cit.; Weber, 47; and Olden
berg, 366, n. 1, seems very doubtful.

Society, 1907, 844, 845. 4) Especially Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,

राजस्तम्बायन
राज-स्तम्बायन,
 ‘descendant of Rājastamba,’ is the patro
nymic of Yajñavacas in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) x. 4, 2, 1 (oxytone), 6, 5, 9 (pro
paroxytone). No stress need be laid 
on the accents of the Satapatha Brāh
maṇa.

राजाधिराज
राजाधिराज,
 ‘king of kings,’ later a title of paramount 
sovereignty, is only found in Vedic literature in the late 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 31, 6) as a divine epithet.

राजाश्व
राजाश्व
 (‘king's horse’) in the Atharvaveda (vi. 102, 2) 
seems merely to denote a powerful horse.

राज्ञी
राज्ञी,
 ‘queen,’ is found in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 and in 
the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 6, 2; 4, 
2, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 8, 3, 9; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 3, 8; Vājasa
neyi Saṃhitā, xiv. 13; xv. 10. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 2, 6, 2; 
iii. 11, 3, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 23, 
2, etc.

राज्य
राज्य
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 regularly denotes 
‘sovereign power,’ from which, as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 
notes, the Brahmin is excluded. 
In addition to Rājya, the texts give other expressions of 
sovereign power. Thus the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	4 contends 
that the Rājasūya sacrifice is that of a king, the Vājapeya that 
of a Samrāj or emperor, the status of the latter (Sāmrājya) 
being superior to that of the former (Rājya). The sitting on a 
throne (Āsandī) is given in the same text
	5 as one of the 
characteristics of the Samrāj. Elsewhere
	6 Svārājya, ‘uncon
trolled dominion,’ is opposed to Rājya. In the ritual of the 
Rājasūya the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	7 gives a whole series of 
terms: Rājya, Sāmrājya, Bhaujya, Svārājya, Vairājya, Pāra
meṣṭhya, and Māhārājya, while Ādhipatya, ‘supreme power,’ is 
found elsewhere.
	8 But there is no reason to believe that these 
terms refer to essentially different forms of authority. A king 
might be called a Mahārāja or a Samrāj, without really being 
an overlord of kings; he would be so termed if he were an 
important sovereign, or by his own entourage out of compli
ment, as was Janaka of Videha.
	9 That a really great monarchy 
of the Aśoka or Gupta type ever existed in the Vedic period 
seems highly improbable.

 the demon that eclipses the sun, seems to be referred 
to in one passage of the Atharvaveda.

Śunaḥśepa's double inheritance, which, 
according to that text, is the learning 
of the Gāthins and the sovereignty of 
the Jahnus; but see Weber, Episches 
im vedischen Ritual, 16, who thinks the 
real succession was to the two houses, 
the Āṅgirasa and the Kuśika). 1) iii. 31, 2, on which cf. Nirukta,

 is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 13, 
3), where she is said to have run round Kurukṣetra, and so to 
have defeated Indra, who understood her challenge to refer to 
the earth proper. The story indicates the connexion of the 
Ruśamas with the Kurus.

रुषती
रुषती
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 denotes, according to 
Ludwig,
	2 a maiden who was married to Śyāva. On the other 
hand, Roth
	3 treats the word as ruśatī, ‘white,’ and ruśatīm 
seems clearly to be the reading of the text. It is doubtful what 
the meaning is, and whether Śyāva is a proper name at all.

रेवा,
 a name of the Narmadā (Nerbudda) river, otherwise 
occurring only in post-Vedic literature, is seen by Weber
	1 in 
the word Revottaras, which is found in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	2 and is certainly a man's name. 1) Indian Literature, 123 (‘a native of the country south of the Revā’). Cf.

doubtful.

रोमशा
रोमशा
 is mentioned in the Bṛhaddevatā
	1 as the wife of king 
Bhāvayavya, and is credited with the authorship of a Rigvedic 
verse.
	2 But in reality the word romaśā in that verse, which is 
the source of the legend, is merely an adjective meaning ‘hairy.’ 1) iii. 156 et seq., with Macdonell's 
notes. 2) i. 126, 7. 
Cf. Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 128.

Mādhyaṃdina recension (v. 12, 1).

लवण
लवण,
 ‘salt,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda, only once 
in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and not after that until the latest part of 
the Brāhmaṇas,
	2 where it is regarded as of extremely high 
value.
	3 This silence in the early period is somewhat surprising 
if the regions then occupied by the Indians were the Panjab 
and the Indus valley, where salt abounds; it would at first 
sight seem less curious if the home of the early Vedic Indian is 
taken to be Kurukṣetra.
	4 It is, however, quite conceivable 
that a necessary commodity might happen to be passed over 
without literary mention in a region where it is very common, 
but to be referred to in a locality where it is not found, and 
consequently becomes highly prized. 1) vii. 76, 1. 2) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7 = 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad, iii. 17, 3. Cf. also

Strabo, xv. 1, 30. 3) It seems to be placed above gold in 
value in Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7. 4) Cf. Map 19 in the Atlas of the

maṇī (Index) of the Rigveda. 1) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 2, 22;

लुशाकपिखार्गलि
लुशाकपि खार्गलि
 (‘descendant of Khṛgala’) is mentioned 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as having cursed Kuṣītaka and 
the Kauṣītakins. He was a contemporary of Keśin Dālbhya 
according to the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.

लोक
लोक
 denotes ‘world’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 Mention 
is often made of the three worlds,
	3 and ayaṃ lokaḥ, ‘this 
world,’
	4 is constantly opposed to asau lokaḥ,
	5 ‘yonder world’ 
-i.e., ‘heaven.’ Loka itself sometimes means ‘heaven,’
	6 
while in other passages several different sorts of world are 
mentioned.
	7 1) Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v. 2, quotes no example of this mean
ing for the Rigveda, where he sees the 
word used only in the sense of ‘place,’ 
‘room,’ ‘free or open space.’ But Rv. 
x. 14, 9, is a fairly certain example of 
the wider sense. 2) Av. viii. 9, 1. 15; iv. 38, 5; xi. 5, 7; 
8, 10, etc.; in ix. 5, 14, the worlds of 
heaven (divya) and of earth (pārthiva) 
are distinguished; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxxii. 11 et seq., etc. 3) Av. x. 6, 31; xii. 3, 20; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 8; Satapatha Brāh

hitā, i. 5, 9, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,

x. 5, 4, 16; xi. 2, 7, 19; and so probably 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 13, 12. 7) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxvi. 4; Kauṣī

लोध
लोध
 occurs in a very obscure verse of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
Roth
	2 conjectures that some sort of ‘red’ animal is meant, and 
Oldenberg
	3 shows some reason for thinking that a ‘red goat’ is 
intended. 1) iii. 53, 23. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 3) Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 255. 
Cf. the obscure adhī-lodha-karṇa in 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 16, 1, 
perhaps meaning ‘having quite red 
ears.’ Yāska, Nirukta, iv. 12, equates 
the word with lubdha, ‘confused,’ but 
this does not suit the context. So also 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84; Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 2, 160; Ṛgveda, Glossar, 
151, who sees in the word the designa
tion of a noble steed.

लोपा
लोपा
 is mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	1 where Sāyaṇa 
explains it as a kind of bird, perhaps the carrion crow (śmaśāna- 
śakuni). 1) v. 5, 18, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 93.

लोपामुद्रा
लोपा-मुद्रा
 appears in one hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
she is seemingly the wife of Agastya, whose embraces she 
solicits.
	2 1) i. 179, 4. 2) The story is differently told in the 
Bṛhaddevatā, iv. 57 et seq., with Mac
donell's notes. See also Oldenberg,

Gesellschaft, 39, 68; Göttingische Gelehrte

लोपाश
लोपाश
 is the name of an animal, probably the ‘jackal’ or 
‘fox,’ which is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and is included in 
the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	2 1) x. 28, 4. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 21, 1;

saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 36. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 84.

लोह
लोह,
 primarily an adjective meaning ‘red,’ is used as a 
neuter substantive to designate a metal, probably ‘copper,’ but 
possibly ‘bronze.’ It is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 
and the Taittīriya Saṃhitā
	2 as distinguished from Śyāma. It 
also occurs several times in the Brāhmaṇas.
	3 See Ayas. 1) xviii. 13. 2) iv. 7, 5, 1. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 2, 2, 18; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 7; vi. 1, 5; 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 
where Oertel takes ‘copper’ to be 
meant in contrast with Ayas, which he 
renders ‘brass.’ The sense of ‘iron’ 
is nowhere needed. 
Cf. Vincent Smith, Indian Antiquary, 
34, 230; and on the early history of 
metals; Mosso, Mediterranean Civiliza- 
tion, 57-62.

लोहमणि
लोह-मणि
 in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (vi. 2, 5) denotes a 
‘copper amulet,’ as Böhtlingk
	1 renders it, rather than a ‘lump 
of gold,’ as translated by Max Müller following the scholiast. 1) Cf. Little, Grammatical Index, 134.

लोहायस
लोहायस,
 ‘red metal,’ is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	1 where it is distinguished from Ayas and gold. In the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	2 the contrast is with Kārṣṇā 
yasa, ‘iron,’ and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	3 with Kṛṣṇāyasa, 
‘iron.’ ‘Copper’ seems to be meant. 1) v. 4, 1, 1. 2. 2) iii. 17, 3. 3) iii. 62, 6, 5. 
Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 41, 90, n.; Schrader, Prehistoric 
Antiquities, 189.

लोहित
लोहित,
 often occurring as an adjective meaning ‘red,’ is 
used as a neuter substantive in the Atharvaveda (xi. 3, 7) to 
denote a metal, presumably ‘copper.’ As a proper name it is 
found in Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xxiv. 9, 7.

लोहितायस
लोहितायस,
 ‘red metal,’ ‘copper,’ is the variant of Loha in 
the Maitrāyaṇī (ii. 11, 5; iv. 4, 4) and Kāṭhaka (xviii. 10) 
Saṃhitās.

लोहिताहि
लोहिताहि,
 ‘red snake,’ is the name of a variety of serpent 
mentioned in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse 
sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 95.

लौहित्य
लौहित्य,
 ‘descendant of Lohita,’ is the patronymic of a 
large number of teachers in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, 
which clearly must have been the special object of study of the 
Lauhitya family. See Kṛṣṇadatta, Kṛṣṇarāta, Jayaka, Tri- 
veda Kṛṣṇarāta, Dakṣa Jayanta, Palligupta, Mitrabhūti, 
Yaśasvin Jayanta, Vipaścit Dṛḍhajayanta, Vaipaścita 
Dārḍhajayanti, Vaipaścita Dārḍhajayanti Dṛḍhajayanta, Śyā- 
majayanta, Śyāmasujayanta, Satyaśravas. A Lauhitya or 
Lauhikya is also mentioned as a teacher in the Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka.
	1 The form of name (Jayanta) affected by the family, 
and the silence of the older texts, proves that they were 
modern. 1) vii. 22; Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 50, n. 1.

वंश
1. Vaṃśa, denoting the ‘rafters’ or ‘beams’ of the house as 
made of bamboo cane, is found in this sense from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards.
	2 Cf. Tiraścīnavaṃśa, Prācīnavaṃśa, and see Gṛha. 1) i. 10, 1. 2) Av. iii. 12, 6; ix. 3, 4; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, iv. 8, 10; Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa, i. 2, 3, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
ix. 1, 2, 25; śālā-vaṃśa, Aitareya Āraṇ
yaka, iii. 2, 1; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 
viii. 1, where perhaps the main beam 
of the house is meant. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 71, 153; Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 346.

वंश
2. Vaṃśa (lit. ‘bamboo’) in the sense of ‘spiritual gene
alogy,’
	1 ‘list of teachers,’ is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 
the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	3 and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.
	4 1) From the analogy of the successive 
joints of the bamboo. Cf. ‘family

vi. 3, 14. 3) Indische Studien, 4, 374. 4) xv. 1.

वंशनर्तिन्
वंश-नर्तिन्
 is mentioned as one of the victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 A ‘pole
dancer’ or ‘acrobat’ seems to be meant. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 21; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 17, 1. Cf. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 290.

वंसग

Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	2 he was engaged in a ritual dispute with 
Dhṛtarāṣṭra. 1) i. 2, 13; 12, 1. 2) xxx. 2 (Indische Studien, 3, 471).

	1 1) vi. 50, 3; ix. 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

वङ्ग
वङ्ग,
 the designation of Bengal proper is not found in the 
earlier Vedic literature unless it is to be recognized in the 
curious word Vaṅgāvagadhāḥ, which occurs in the Aitareya 
Āraṇyaka,
	1 and which suggests amendment to Vaṅga-Magadhāḥ, 
‘the Vaṅgas and the Magadhas,’ two neighbouring peoples. 
The name is certainly found in the Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra.
	2 1) ii. 1, 1. Cf. Keith, Aitareya Āraṇ- 
yaka, 200; Magadha-Vaṅga-Matsyāḥ 
occurs in the Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭas 
(i. 7, 7). but that is very late. 2) i. 1, 14. Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha,

sense of ‘calf.’ Reference is made to the use of a calf to induce 
the cow to give milk,
	3 and to the separation of the cows from 
the calves at certain times.

Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 11c.

वत्स
2. Vatsa occurs several times in the Rigveda
	1 as the name 
of a singer, a son or descendant of Kaṇva. In the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 he is said to have passed successfully through a fire 
ordeal to which he resorted for the purpose of proving to his 
rival, Medhātithi, the purity of his descent. He is also mentioned

	2 weapon in the Rigveda. 1) i. 32, 9, etc. 2) Rv. iv. 22, 9; viii. 22, 8; 24, 27. 
Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 
221.

वधू
1. Vadhū is a frequent word for ‘woman’ in the Rigveda
	1 
and later.
	2 It denotes, according to Delbrück,
	3 the woman as 
either married or as seeking a husband, or as a bride in the 
wedding ceremony. The word appears to be derived from a 
form of the root vah, ‘to carry,’ as is vahatu, ‘the bridal pro
cession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted 
home.’ Zimmer,
	4 however, objects to this explanation, 
regarding vadhū as a derivative from a different root meaning 
‘to marry.’ 1) v. 37, 3; 47, 6; vii. 69, 3; viii. 26, 
13; x. 27, 12; 85, 30; 107, 9. 2) Av. i. 14, 2; iv. 20, 3; x. 1, 1; 
xiv. 2, 9, 41, etc. 3) Die indogermanischen Verwandtschafts- 
namen, 414, 439. 4) Altindsiches Leben, 108.

वधू
2. Vadhū is in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 taken by Roth
	2 
to denote a ‘female animal,’ while Zimmer
	3 urges that it 
means a ‘female slave.’ As far as the use of Vadhū goes, 
either meaning is abnormal, for if Vadhū never elsewhere 
means a female animal (from vah, to ‘draw’ a cart), neither does 
it denote a slave: as the passage refers to a gift of fifty Vadhūs 
by Trasadasyu Paurukutsya to the singer, the latter must 
have been a polygamist of an advanced type to require fifty 
wives. The same doubt arises in the case of vadhūmant, which 
is used in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda as an epithet of the 
chariot (Ratha),
	4 of horses (Aśva),
	5 and of buffaloes (Uṣṭra).
	6 
Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or 
with the horses: this interpretation has the support of the 
Bṛhaddevatā.
	7 Roth's version of the references to horses or 
buffaloes as ‘suitable for draught’ is not very happy; if vadhū 
is really a female animal vadhūmant means rather ‘together with 
mares,’ or ‘together with female buffaloes,’ which makes reason
able sense.

taken by Pischel, Vedische Studien, 2,

वध्रिमती
वध्रिमती,
 ‘having an impotent man as a husband,’ seems 
in the Rigveda
	1 to be the name of a woman who owed the 
restoration of her husband's virility to the Aśvins, and obtained 
a son, Hiraṇyahasta. The word is, however, possibly only 
descriptive. 1) i. 116, 13; 117, 24; vi. 62, 7; x. 39, 7; 65, 12.

वध्र्यश्व
1. Vadhry-aśva, ‘having castrated horses,’ is the name in 
the Rigveda
	1 of a prince, the father of Divodāsa, and an 
energetic supporter of the fire cult, as was his son after him. 
He is mentioned in a long list of names in the Atharvaveda.
	2 1) vi. 61, 1; x. 69, 1 et seq. Sumitra, 
in the latter hymn, can hardly be a 
name of his. 2) iv. 29, 4. Cf. Āpastamba Śrauta 
Sūtra, xxiv. 6, 6. 
Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie. 
1, 97.

of the seer of a Sāman, or chant, in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 
(xiii. 3, 17).

वन
वन
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes the ‘forest,’ not 
necessarily of trees only, but, like Araṇya, the wild uninhabited 
land.
	3 It also means ‘wooden cup’ used in the Soma ritual,
	4 
and in one passage perhaps a part of the chariot.
	5 1) i. 54, 1; 65, 8; iii. 51, 5; v. 41, 11, 
etc. 2) Kauśika Sūtra, lxxvi. 3, etc. 3) Rv. vii. 1, 19 (opposed to dama,

वनप
वन-प,
 ‘forest-guardian,’ is included in the list of victims 
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.

Dāvapa. 1) Vājasaneyi Samhitā, xxx. 19; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 11, 1.

वनर्गु
वनर्-गु,
 ‘forest-goer,’ is used in the Rigveda
	1 and the 
Atharvaveda
	2 to designate robbers who haunt the forests. In 
the Sāmaveda
	3 the term is more generally opposed to civilized 
men (kavayaḥ, ‘sages’; vanargavaḥ, ‘savages’). 1) x. 4, 6. 2) iv. 36, 7. 3) Āraṇya Saṃhitā, iv. 9. 
Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

वनस्पति
वनस्-पति,
 ‘lord of the forest,’ primarily denotes ‘tree,’
	1 and 
then ‘post’ or ‘pole.’
	2 In some passages it is applied either 
to a part of the chariot or to the chariot as a whole.
	3 It also 
means a ‘wooden drum’
	4 and a ‘wooden amulet,’
	5 while in

वम्रक
 is mentioned in one passage of the Rigveda,

Roth
	2 thinks that an ‘ant’ is meant. But Pischel,

 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 in con
nexion with Turvīti, of whom the word is, according to Sāyaṇa,

a patronymic in one passage. Roth
	3 is inclined to think that 
the sense of ‘companion’ would suit all passages. 1) i. 54, 6; 112, 6 (where Turvīti does

seems to be, as Roth
	2 thought, the name of a stream, and is 
regarded by Ludwig

 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘thong’ or 
‘strap.’ It was used to fasten the oxen to the yoke,

वरशिख
वरशिख
 is the name of a leader whose tribe is mentioned 
in the Rigveda
	1 as being defeated by Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna 1) vi. 27, 4. 5. Cf. Ludwig, Transla
tion of the Rigveda, 3, 156; Hillebrandt, 
Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105; Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 133, who thinks that 
Varaśikha was the leader of the Tur- 
vaśa-Vṛcīvants, but this is conjectural, 
and not very probable. Cf. Pārthava. 
In the Bṛhaddevatā, v. 124 et seq., the 
form of the name is Vāraśikha (‘de
scendant of Varaśikha’), occurring in 
the plural only.

वराह
वराह,
 ‘boar,’ is found in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 The 
god Rudra is described as the ‘boar of heaven.’

that, even in the Rigveda, its use is 
predominantly metaphorical, x. 28, 4, 
and x. 86, 4, being the only clear 
instances of the real sense, and of these 
x. 86, 4, is doubtful. See also Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 3, 66 et seq.

वरु
वरु
 is held by Sāyaṇa to be a proper name in several 
passages of the Rigveda,
	1 where it is accented as a vocative 
followed by suṣāmṇe. Roth
	2 considers that the name must be 
Varosuṣāman, despite its doubtful formation. 1) viii. 23, 28; 24, 28; 26, 2. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

वर्चिन्
वर्चिन्
 is the name of a foe of Indra in the Rigveda.
	1 Being 
called a Dāsa,
	2 and coupled with Śambara, he is probably to be 
regarded as a terrestrial foe, though he is also spoken of as an 
Asura.
	3 He may possibly have been connected with the 
Vṛcīvants. 1) ii. 14, 6; iv. 30, 14. 15; vi. 47, 21;

वर्ण
1. Varṇa, ‘colour,’ is a common word in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 A large number of colours are enumerated in Vedic 
literature, but it is not possible to deduce any clear information 
as to the accuracy with which the Vedic Indian distinguished 
colours, or as to the principle on which his distinctions were based. 
The Rigveda seems to show that red or yellow colours were 
the most noticed, but this may be accidental.
	3 ‘Black’ or 
‘dark’ is denoted by kṛṣṇa, ‘white’ or ‘light-coloured’ by śukla 
or śveta. ‘Black’ seems to be meant in one passage of the 
Rigveda
	4 by śyenī also. ‘Dark-grey’ or ‘dusky’ is expressed 
by śyāma.
	5 The sense of nīla
	6 is doubtful, perhaps ‘dark-blue,’ 
‘bluish-black.’ The series of words hari, hariṇa, harit, harita, 
seems, on the whole, to denote ‘yellow,’ but ‘green’ is also a 
possible rendering, since the epithet is used of the frog.
	7 
‘Brown’ is certainly the meaning of babhru, which is used of 
the Vibhītaka nut (see Akṣa). ‘Reddish-brown’ seems to be 
the tinge implied by kapila
	8 (‘monkey-coloured’), while piṅgala 
appears to denote a shade of brown in which yellow pre 
dominates, ‘tawny.’
	9 ‘Yellow’ is expressed by pīta as well as 
pāṇḍu.
	10 A garment of saffron (māhārajana) is mentioned in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	11 Rudhira and lohita are red, while 
aruṇa is ‘ruddy.’ Kalmāṣa means ‘spotted,’
	12 and śilpa 
‘dappled,’
	13 while mingled shades like aruṇa-piśaṅga, ‘reddish 
brown,’ also occur.

250, 251. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 3, 7. 6) The nīla of the Chāndogya Upani
śad iii. 6, 1, is replaced by kṛṣṇa in 
the Kausītaki Upaniṣad iv. to Cf. 
Rv. viii. 19, 31. In the post-Vedic 
language nīla describes the colour of 
dark blue objects, such as indigo, 
sapphire, etc. That the word already 
had some such sense in the Rigveda is 
suggested by its use in allusions to the 
smoke of Agni. 7) Rv. vii. 103, 6, and cf. iii. 44, 3;

वर्ण
2. Varṇa (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda
	1 is applied to denote 
classes of men, the Dāsa and the Āryan Varṇa being contrasted, 
as other passages
	2 show, on account of colour. But this use is 
confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the 
Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and 
Brāhmaṇas,
	3 where the four castes (varṇāḥ) are already fully 
recognized. 
(a) Caste in the Rigveda. — The use of the term Varṇa is not, 
of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed 
in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have 
existed: the Puruṣa-sūkta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth 
Maṇḍala
	4 clearly contemplates the division of mankind into 
four classes — the Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. But 
the hymn being admittedly late,
	5 its evidence is not cogent for 
the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer
	6 has with great force com
batted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society 
that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāh
maṇas
	7 show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrah
minized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the 
Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region 
and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had 
wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the 
caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir,
	8 derived 
from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that (a) the 
four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; (b) the term 
Varṇa, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later 
times, and is only contrasted with Dāsa; (c) that Brāhmaṇa is 
rare in the Rigveda, Kṣatriya occurs seldom,
	9 Rājanya only in 
the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, Vaiśya and Śūdra are 
found; (d) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and 
then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest; 
(e) that in some only of the passages
	10 where it occurs does 
Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it 
denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a 
person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to 
receive divine inspiration.
	11 Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, as 
Muir admits,
	12 already denotes a hereditary professional priest
hood. 
Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the 
Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the 
advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Ger
manic invasions that transformed the German tribes into 
monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a 
conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink 
to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines 
or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the 
subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the 
shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility 
of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers, 
as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon 
monarchies.
	13 At the same time the people ceased to take 
part in military matters, and under climatic influences 
left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers, 
devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and 
trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the 
people was shared by them with the priesthood, the 
origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth 
first saw.
	14 
Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the 
people, but the Rigveda
	15 itself shows cases, like those of 
Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha illustrating forcibly the power of the 
Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act 
as Purohita is seen in the case of Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa.
	16 The 
Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of 
gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of 
the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many 
struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition.
	17 
The Atharvaveda
	18 also preserves relics of these conflicts in its 
narration of the ruin of the Sṛñjayas because of oppressing 
Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viii
xii), the Śatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda
	19 reflects the 
period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was 
still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as 
the patron god of all sorts of evil doers.
	20 
This version of the development of caste has received a good 
deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be 
regarded as the recognized version.
	21 It has, however, always 
been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug,
	22 Kern,
	23 
Ludwig,
	24 and more recently by Oldenberg
	25 and by Geldner.
	26 
The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing 
at once that the caste system is one that has progressively 
developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda 
the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same 
time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on 
its way to general acceptance. The argument from the non
brahminical character of the Vrātyas of the Indus and Panjab 
loses its force when it is remembered that there is much 
evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the 
Rigveda, especially the books
	27 in which Sudās appears with 
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in the east, the later Madhyadeśa, a 
view supported by Pischel,
	28 Geldner,
	29 Hopkins,
	30 and Mac
donell.
	31 Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the 
Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by 
Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary pro
fession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs 
where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest 
was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the 
Rigveda of the threefold
	32 or fourfold
	33 division of the people 
into brahma, kṣatram, and viśaḥ, or into the three classes and 
the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period, 
any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards 
the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently
	34 
knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers, 
but the late Atharvaveda
	35 equally classes the folk with the 
bala, ‘power,’ representing the Viś as associated with the Sabhā, 
Samiti, and Senā, the assemblies of the people and the armed 
host. Zimmer
	36 explains these references as due to tradition 
only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it 
does, on the false assumption that only a Kṣatriya can fight. 
But it is (see Kṣatriya) very doubtful whether Kṣatriya means 
anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in 
the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased 
in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though 
later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars, 
an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated 
as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary 
body; monarchy was already hereditary (see Rājan), and it is 
admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the 
elements of the caste system were already in existence. The 
Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is 
clear, as Oldenberg
	37 urges, that he was not the creator of the 
power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence 
he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice 
required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary 
priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred know
ledge. 
Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste 
system be derived from cases like that of Devāpi. For, in the 
first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the 
priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads 
are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system. 
In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for 
Devāpi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the 
Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Yāska
	38 calls him a 
Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be 
vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again, 
the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or 
‘royal sages’; and the famous Viśvāmitra shows in the Rigveda 
no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist 
on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of 
Jahnu.
	39 
(b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas. — The relation 
between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history 
of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the 
hardening of a system already formed by the time of the 
Rigveda. 
1. The Names of the Castes. — The most regular names are 
Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra,
	40 or later Brāhmaṇa, 
Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra.
	41 There are many other variants: 
Brahman, Kṣatra, Śūdrāryau;
	42 Brahman, Rājanya, Śūdra, 
Ārya;
	43 Brahman, Rājanya, Vaiśya, Śūdra;
	44 Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, 
Viśya, Śūdra;
	45 Deva, Rājan, Śūdra, Ārya;
	46 and Brahman, 
Kṣatra, Viś, and Śūdra.
	47 In other cases the fourth class is repre
sented by a special member: Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and 
Cāṇḍāla.
	48 Often only the three upper classes are mentioned, 
as Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya;
	49 Brahman, Kṣatram, Viś,
	50 
etc.
	51 Three castes — Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, Śūdra — are mentioned 
in the Atharvaveda,
	52 and two castes are repeatedly men
tioned together, either Brahman and Kṣatra, or Kṣatra and 
Viś.
	53 
2. The Relation of the Castes. — The ritual literature is full of 
minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example, 
the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for 
the four castes,
	54 Different modes of address are laid down for 
the four castes,
	55 as ehi, ‘approach’; āgaccha, ‘come’; ādrava, 
‘run up’; ādhāva, ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of 
politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated 
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities.
	56 
The Sūtras have many similar rules.
	57 
But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly 
from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	58 declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita, 
‘consecrated person,’ and no Śūdra is to milk the cow whose 
milk is to be used for the Agnihotra
	59 (‘fire-oblation’). On the 
other hand, in certain passages, the Śūdra is given a place in 
the Soma sacrifice,
	60 and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	61 there 
are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only 
for the three upper castes, but also for the Rathakāra, 
‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	62 the Brāh
maṇa is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of 
the other three castes. 
The characteristics of the several castes are given under 
Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Rājan, Vaiśya, Śūdra: they may be 
briefly summed up as follows: The Viś forms the basis of the 
state on which the Brahman and Kṣatra rest;
	63 the Brahman 
and Kṣatra are superior to the Viś;
	64 while all three classes are 
superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with 
the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be 
deemed the Kṣatriya element. Engaged in the business of the 
protection of the country, its administration, the decision of 
legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the 
revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to 
them villages (see Grāma) for their maintenance, while some of 
them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by 
slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small:
	65 there 
are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the 
mention of Mahārājas. The people, engaged in agriculture, 
pastoral pursuits, and trade (Vaṇij), paid tribute to the king 
and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as Baden
Powell suggests,
	66 they were not themselves agriculturists is 
probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large 
scale, and draw their revenues from Śūdra tenants, or even 
Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this 
position is extremely unlikely.
	67 In war the people shared 
the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute 
separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests 
may be divided into two classes — the Purohitas of the kings, 
who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a 
position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident 
they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives, 
except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king 
or a wealthy noble.
	68 
The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up 
in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	69 which treats of them 
as opposed to the Kṣatriya. The Brāhmaṇa is a receiver of 
gifts (ā-dāyī), a drinker of Soma (ā-pāyī), a seeker of food 
(āvasāyī),
	70 and liable to removal at will (yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ).
	71 
The Vaiśya is tributary to another (anyasya balikṛt), to be lived 
on by another (anyasyādyaḥ), and to be oppressed at will (yathā- 
kāma-jyeyaḥ).
	72 The Śūdra is the servant of another (anyasya 
preṣyaḥ), to be expelled at will (kāmotthāpyaḥ), and to be slain 
at pleasure (yathākāma-vadhyaḥ).
	73 The descriptions seem 
calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the 
Rājanya. Even the Brāhmaṇa he can control, whilst the 
Vaiśya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove 
without cause from his land,
	74 but who is still free, and whom 
he cannot maim or slay without due process. The Śūdra has 
no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the 
king. 
The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Kṣatriya 
is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in 
the course of time the Vaiśya fell more and more in position 
with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber
	75 shows 
reason for believing that the Vājapeya sacrifice, a festival of 
which a chariot race forms an integral part,
	76 was, as the 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	77 says, once a sacrifice for a Vaiśya, 
as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer 
diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the 
Taittirīya texts
	78 show that the Vājapeya was originally a lesser 
sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the 
Rājasūya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings, 
and in that of the Brahmin by the Bṛhaspatisava, a festival 
celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	79 exalts the Vājapeya, in which a priest 
could be the sacrificer, over the Rājasūya, from which he was 
excluded, and identifies it with the Bṛhaspatisava, a clear piece 
of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we 
must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the 
exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the Śatapatha 
and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the 
priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests 
of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in 
the Madhyadeśa. Another side of the picture is presented in 
the Pāli literature,
	80 which, belonging to a later period than the 
Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests; 
while the Epic,
	81 more nearly contemporaneous with the later 
Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal 
superiority of the nobility in clear light. 
Although clear distinctions were made between the different 
castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the 
leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity com
municated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes,
	82 
which is seen both directly in the purification rendered 
necessary in case of contact with a Śūdra, and indirectly in the 
prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste.
	83 It 
is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does 
appear,
	84 but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to 
preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain 
rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the 
same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire 
the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental com
munion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to 
take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying 
purity.
	85 Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the 
constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals 
which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not 
found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature.
	86 The Vedic 
characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common 
occupation, and restriction on intermarriage. 
3. Restrictions on Intermarriage. — Arrian, in his Indica,
	87 
probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibi
tion of marriage between , no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic 
of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature
	88 is in favour of 
this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he 
wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir apparent. 
But it equally shows that there were others who held that not 
the father's but the mother's rank determined the social 
standing of the son. Though Manu
	89 recognizes the possibility 
of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate 
children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with 
a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra
	90 allows 
the marriage of a Kṣatriya with a wife of his own caste or of 
the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or 
of the two lower classes, and of a Vaiśya with a Vaiśya wife 
only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can 
marry a Śūdra wife, while other authorities condemn the 
marriage with a Śūdra wife in certain circumstances, which 
implies that in other cases it might be justified.
	91 The earlier 
literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on 
descent from a Ṛṣi, and on purity of descent;
	92 but there is 
other evidence for the view that even a Brāhmaṇa need not be 
of pure lineage. Kavaṣa Ailūṣa is taunted with being the son 
of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’
	93 and Vatsa was accused of being a 
Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt 
through the flames of a fire ordeal.
	94 He who is learned 
(śuśruvān) is said to be a Brāhmaṇa, descended from a Ṛṣi 
(ārṣeya), in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;
	95 and Satyakāma, son of 
Jabālā, was accepted as a pupil by Hāridrumata Gautama, 
though he could not name his father.
	96 The Kāṭhaka Saṃ
hitā
	97 says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But 
all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity 
in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based 
on heredity. The Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	98 recognize the illicit 
union of Ārya and Śūdrā, and vice versa: it is not unlikely that 
if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible. 
The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	99 indeed, recognizes such a case in 
that of Dīrghatamas, son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may 
adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā.
	100 
In a hymn of the Atharvaveda
	101 extreme claims are put 
forward for the Brāhmaṇa, who alone is a true husband and 
the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Rājanya 
or a Vaiśya: a Śūdra husband is not mentioned, probably on 
purpose.
	102 The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with Rājanya women 
is illustrated by the cases of Sukanyā, daughter of king 
Śaryāta, who married Cyavana,
	103 and of Rathavīti's daughter, 
who married Śyāvāśva.
	104 
4. Occupation and Caste. — The Greek authorities
	105 and the 
evidence of the Jātakas
	106 concur in showing it to have been 
the general rule that each caste was confined to its own 
occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many 
professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave 
members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas
	107 
recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations, 
as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are 
somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas 
and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own pro
fessions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions. 
Ludwig
	108 sees in Dīrghaśravas in the Rigveda
	109 a Brahmin 
reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even 
later by the Sūtra literature; but this is not certain, though it 
is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far 
the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here 
is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of 
Viśvāmitra. In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest 
who is attached to the court of Sudās, king of the Tṛtsus; but 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	110 he is called a king, a descendant 
of Jahnu, and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	111 refers to Śunaḥśepa's 
succeeding, through his adoption by Viśvāmitra, to the divine 
lore (daiva veda) of the Gāthins and the lordship of the Jahnus. 
That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable, 
but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal 
origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa,
	112 which knows the technical terms Rājanyarṣi and 
Devarājan corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The 
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	113 says of one who knows a certain 
doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ (rājā sann ṛṣir 
bhavati), and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	114 applies the 
term Rājanya to a Brāhmaṇa. Again, it is argued that Devāpi 
Ārṣṭiṣeṇa, who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda,
	115 
for Śantanu, was a prince, as Yāska
	116 says or implies he 
was.
	117 But this assumption seems to be only an error of 
Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relation
ship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view
	118 that the Rigveda 
recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince 
acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation. 
The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in 
the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir
	119 has argued 
that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa,
	120 regards many 
hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he 
admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be 
added that in the case of Pṛthī Vainya, where the hymn
	121 
ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn 
itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	122 
calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than 
the later tradition as to Viśvāmitra. The case of Viśvantara 
and the Śyāparṇas mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	123 has 
been cited
	124 as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid, 
but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of 
the Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas, and Bhūtavīras mentioned in the 
course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king 
had other priests to carry out the sacrifice. 
Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the 
Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal 
persons. Thus Janaka is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	125 
to have become a Brahman; Ajātaśatru taught Gārgya 
Bālāki;
	126 Pravāhaṇa Jaivali instructed Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,
	127 
as well as Śilaka Śālāvatya
	128 and Caikitāyana Dālbhya; 
and Aśvapati Kaikeya taught Brahmins.
	129 It has been 
deduced
	130 from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a 
product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely 
doubtful,
	131 for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by 
the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere
	132 
the opinion of a Rājanya is treated with contempt. 
It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not 
much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though 
it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But 
that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste 
took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example. 
That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have 
taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick
	133 
points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the 
later period at least, become a Śramaṇa, as is recorded in effect 
of many kings in the Epic.
	134 Whether the practice is Vedic is 
not clear: Yāska
	135 records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence 
for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism. 
On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas, 
accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the 
mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight,
	136 as Vasiṣṭha 
and Viśvāmitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in 
the Epic from time to time.
	137 But a priest cannot be said to 
change caste by acting in this way. 
More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of 
caste may be seen in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	138 where 
Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana is represented as speaking of his off
spring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and 
commons of the Śalvas; and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	139 
where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made 
his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken Ṛṣi 
of the Rigveda
	140 talks as if he could be converted into a king. 
On the other hand, certain kings, such as Para Āṭṇāra, are 
spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’
	141 As 
evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a 
Brahmin might become a king, while the Ṛṣi in the Rigveda is 
represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great 
kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were 
consecrated (dīkṣita), and so temporarily became Brahmins.
	142 
The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would 
be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is 
not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of 
Satyakāma Jābāla do not go far; for ex hypothesi that teacher 
did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite 
well have been a Brahmin. 
It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles 
practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a 
closed body into which a man must be born. These two 
Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas 
offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of 
occupations (see Vaiśya). Fick
	143 concludes that there is no 
exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the 
Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups, 
which themselves practised endogamy such as the gahapatis, or 
smaller landowners, the setthis, or large merchants and members 
of the various guilds, while there are clear traces
	144 in the legal 
textbooks of a view that Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya stand opposed 
to all the other members of the community. But we need 
hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vaiśya, the 
ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all 
probability, which was severed by its free status from the 
Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble 
blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably 
legitimate to hold that any Vaiśya could marry any member of 
the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of 
Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original 
process by which priest and noble had grown into separate 
entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall 
under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the 
social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on 
equal terms — hypergamy is often allowed — and so those Vaiśyas 
who acquired wealth in trade (Śreṣṭhin) or agriculture (the 
Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the 
ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vaiśya as 
a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process 
of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of 
occupation, religion, or geographical situation. 
Fick
	145 denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single 
caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior 
races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally 
as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose 
that Śūdra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the 
nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside 
the three castes — nobles, priests, and people — just as in the 
Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests, 
the nobiles or eorls, and the ingenui, ordinary freemen or ceorls, 
there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic 
expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see 
Śūdra). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly 
be regulated by rules; any Śūdra could wed another, if such a 
marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in 
early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But 
what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less 
and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and 
princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful 
means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and 
when the term Śūdra would cover many sorts of people who 
were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character 
occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of 
the village, like the Caṇḍālas, or tribes living under Āryan 
control, or independent, such as the Niṣādas. 
But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men 
of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation 
of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to 
have been the case with the Rathakāras. In the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa
	146 the Rathakāra is placed as a special class along 
with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly 
be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not 
included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that 
only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other 
evidence
	147 that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But 
in the Atharvaveda
	148 the Rathakāras and the Karmāras 
appear in a position of importance in connexion with the 
selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in 
an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā;
	149 in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa,
	150 too, the Rathakāra is mentioned as a 
a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view 
suggested by Fick
	151 that these classes were originally non
Āryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic 
times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of 
the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified. 
The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan 
conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has 
a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe. 
Similarly, the Karmāra, the Takṣan,
	152 the Carmamna, or 
‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupa
tions in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli 
texts.
	153 
The later theory, which appears fully developed in the 
Dharma Sūtras,
	154 deduces the several castes other than the 
original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This 
theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In 
some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the Sūta is said 
to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if 
the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to 
occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas, 
Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes 
in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic 
period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress 
by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an 
important determining feature, just as in modern times there 
are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or 
Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and Vaṇij (‘merchant’).
	155 
Fick
	156 finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupa
tions whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such 
as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who 
went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in 
the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times 
these people presumably fell under the conception of Śūdra, 
and may have included the Parṇaka, Paulkasa, Bainda, who 
are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa in the list of victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom 
Fick
	157 includes in the same category, were certainly included 
in the term Śūdra. 
5. Origin of the Castes. — The question of the origin of the 
castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the 
extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with 
the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be 
sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning 
between the Āryan and the Śūdra. The contrast which the 
Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the 
conquered population, and which probably rested originally on 
the difference of colour between the upper and the lower 
classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth, 
occupation, and locality which normally existed among the 
Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never 
developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine 
of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste 
system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan 
could marry the Śūdrā, but not the Śūdra the Āryā. This 
distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its 
force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to 
mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of 
America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between 
the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population 
which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons 
of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but 
varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of 
a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race; 
(2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage 
between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark 
race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each 
category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation 
than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is 
what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears, 
then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best repre
sented by Risley,
	158 which explains caste in the main as a 
matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is, 
the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood. 
The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart,
	159 
which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of 
the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in 
affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy. 
A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the 
same gens, according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart 
and Kovalevsky;
	160 and an Athenian must marry an Athenian 
woman, but not one of the same . In India these rules 
are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within 
the Gotra, but not without the caste. The theory, though 
attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek 
parallels are not even probably accurate;
	161 and in India the 
rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows; 
in strictness as the evidence grows later in date.
	162 
On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the 
development of caste may have been helped by the family 
traditions of some gentes, or , or Gotras. The Patricians 
of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the 
plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their  pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and 
there may well have been noble families among the Vedic 
Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The 
Germans known to Tacitus
	163 were divided into nobiles and 
ingenui, and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble 
and non-noble freemen.
	164 The origin of nobility need not be 
sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have 
existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom 
we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king 
often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of, 
the deity;
	165 and that hereditary kingship would tend to 
increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the 
royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain 
the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the 
king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in 
the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar 
exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences 
that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep 
opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines. 
Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions. 
Nesfield
	166 was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of 
caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view 
considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly 
certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The 
carpenters (Takṣan), the chariot-makers (Rathakāra), the fisher
men (Dhaivara) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and 
the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to 
say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its 
first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have 
produced the system of caste without the interposition of the 
fundamental difference between Āryan and Dāsa or Śūdra 
blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly impor
tant what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be 
declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble 
freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which 
seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the 
separation of its various branches. 
It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division 
of classes comparable in some respects
	167 with the Indian 
polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are 
unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to 
correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the 
Śūdras.
	168 But they are certainly not castes in the Indian 
sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of 
Senart
	169 or of Risley
	170 that the names of the old classes were 
later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were 
different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes 
existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed 
by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early 
Brāhmaṇa evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the 
transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes 
and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no 
Varṇa, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class 
occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste.

(śukla); the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xi. 6, 
calls the Vaiśya ‘white’ (śukla), the 
Rājanya ‘swarthy’ (dhūmra); and the 
later view makes the four castes black, 
yellow (pīta), red (rakta), and white re
spectively. See Weber, Indische Studien,

The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the later 
parts of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, with 
their traditions of Aśvamedhas, ‘horse 
sacrifices,’ and their recollections of 
the glories of the Bharatas, represent 
a more advanced stage of social rela
tions and of city life, but even they 
hardly know really great kingdoms. 66) Indian Village Community and Village 
Communities in India, where much stress 
is laid on the idea of a settlement of 
Āryans on lands already occupied by 
Dravidian clans, much as Anglo-Saxon 
invaders on one theory occupied lands 
already held by Britons who became 
serfs, while the invaders were a land
holding aristocracy, a theory supported 
by the fact that the normal holding of 
a hide is estimated at 120 acres. 67) Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 
222. The point is much the same as that 
at issue between the different schools of 
opinion as to early English history. 
Did the Āryans in India occupy the 
land as a people, driving out or ex
terminating or enslaving the Dāsas, 
and themselves carrying on the occupa
tions of a people, or did they merely 
form a small aristocracy of superior 
military force, and were the Kṣatriyas 
the true Āryans? The evidence of the 
Rigveda is really fatal to the latter 
alternative hypothesis. 68) For the superiority of the Brāh
maṇa to the Kṣatriya or Rājanya, see 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 11, 3; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 12; 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1,

vii. 15, 8; viii. 9, 6; Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 20, 12. The Brāh
maṇa is, in his turn, dependent on the 
king (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 3; 
v. 4, 2, 7), and at the Rājasūya sits 
beside him, but is none the less superior 
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 23). 
The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5, says 
the Kṣatra is over the Brahman, but 
this is not a usual view. Cf. xxvii. 4. 
A Brāhmaṇa can get along without a 
Kṣatriya, but not vice versa (Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 6), and a Rājanya 
with a Brāhmaṇa surpasses all other 
Rājanyas (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1, 
10, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10; 
xxvii. 4, etc.). 69) vii. 29. See Muir, op. cit., 1^2, 436 
et seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 14. 70) Weber, op. cit., 9, 326; 10, 14, 
prefers ‘moving’ or ‘dwelling’ every
where. 71) Muir, Haug, and Weber take the 
word as active in sense, ‘moving at 
will.’ But both the parallelism of the 
passage and the formation of the word 
require a passive causative sense. The 
reference is perhaps to the general 
political control of the king over the 
priest, whom he can ‘move on’ from 
place to place. 72) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29, 3. 73) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 29, 4. 74) This seems to be the most prob
able reference of yathākāmajyeyaḥ. The 
expulsion of the Vaiśya is here not in 
allusion to quasi-ownership of land by 
the King or Kṣatriya; it is an act of 
royal authority, not an incident of 
tenure. See Keith, Journal of the

Manu, iv. 210 et seq.; Viṣṇu, 41, 7 et seq.; 
Fick, op. cit., 30-33, who points out 
that the Jātakas contain little evidence 
on the practice. Senart, Les Castes dans 
l'Inde, 48 et seq., 212 et seq., attributes 
great importance to the question of 
eating together, and compares the sacri
ficial meals of the gens at Rome, where 
strangers were excluded (Fustel de 
Coulanges, La Cité Antique, 117). But 
this is not conclusive; a caste is not 
a gens, and the gens excluded strangers 
only at a solemn festival, when the 
whole gens renewed its blood kinship. 
If we have no evidence exactly estab
lishing this for the Gotra in early Vedic 
literature, we need not hesitate to 
believe that in the earliest Vedic period 
the Gotra had solemn festivals of union, 
and of communication with the dead, 
but that again does not explain or 
amount to the caste prohibition of 
taking food from an inferior. 84) E.g., Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3. 
with Keith's note. 85) For a case of objection to eating 
food after another, see Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1. Possibly the idea 
there is that eating the food of a chief 
is dangerous, since the eater thus enters 
into possession of part of his sub
stance, and consequently at once be
comes an object of anger to the chief, 
as well as of danger to himself; for the 
chief may be so full of divine force that 
it would be unsafe for an ordinary man 
to be assimilated to him — a common 
idea in primitive societies. See also 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 8, 13. 86) Fick, op. cit., 24. Senart, op. cit., 
219, 220, compares the family councils 
of Greece, Rome, and Germany (Leist, 
Altarisches Jus Civile, 273 et seq.; Kova
levsky, Famille et Propriété Primitives, 
119; Fustel de Coulanges, op. cit., 118, 
119). But here again the system may 
have applied to the Gotra without its 
really explaining the later appearance 
of the practice in the caste, and the 
absence of the mention of a council in 
the early and late literature alike is 
conclusive against its existence. 87) xii. 8. 9. 88) Fick, op. cit., 34-40. 89) x. 5; iii. 15. 90) i. 4. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien,

Weber, op. cit., 10, 69, takes as referring 
to descent. Brahma-putra is a title of

not clear, but the passage is intended 
to show in the strongest light the high 
position of the Brāhmaṇa. 102) The sense of v. 17, 18, is obscure; 
it can be interpreted to mean that the 
Brāhmaṇa should be provided with a 
temporary wife on each occasion when 
he pays a visit (cf. Whitney, 250). But 
this is hardly likely. Muir takes it as 
referring to his own wife. 103) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 7.

of caste are merely religious or philo
sophical, and have no value. See for 
them, Rv. x. 90 (which is repeated in 
other Saṃhitās); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
vii. 1, 1, 4 et seq.; ibid., iv. 3, 10, 1-3 =

The most important collection of texts 
on caste are those of Muir, Sanskrit 
Texts, 12, and of Weber, Indische Studien, 
10, where practically all the data of the 
Brāhmaṇas are extracted; there have 
to be added only the data of the Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, which are merely con
firmatory of those of the Taittirīya and 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās, The Epic materials 
concerning caste are given by Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
13, who has also analyzed the caste 
relations of the Mānavadharmaśāstra 
in The Mutual Relation of the Four Castes 
according to the Mānavadharmaśāstram.

its date is extremely doubtful, and it 
certainly cannot be regarded as really 
contemporary with Buddha (fifth cen
tury B.C.). The Dharma Sūtras also 
give full details, but their date likewise 
is uncertain.

वश
2. Vaśa, plur., is the name of a tribe mentioned in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 as being in Madhyadeśa along with the 
Kurus, the Pañcālas, and the Uśīnaras. They are also 
connected with the Matsyas according to the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad.
	2 The Vaśas and Uśīnaras are spoken of as united 
in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa:
	3 the names
	4 seem to indicate that 
the Vaśas and Uśīnaras were connected. 1) viii. 14, 3. 2) iv. 1 (reading sa-Vaśa-Matsyeṣu for 
the savasan-Matsyeṣu of the manuscripts, 
which is otherwise emended to Satvan- 
Matsyeṣu, Keith, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, 
36, n. 2; Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1908, 367). 3) i. 2, 9, where the text has Śava- 
sa-Uśīnareṣu, which is nonsense. Cf. 
Sa-Vaśa-Uśīnarāṇām in Aitareya Brāh
maṇa, viii. 14, 3. and n. 2. 4) As both derived from the root vaś, 
‘desire.’ 
Cf. Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n.; 
407, n.

वशा
वशा
 denotes ‘cow’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 According 
to the commentators, the word means a ‘barren cow,’ but this 
is not a necessary sense except in a few passages.
	3 1) ii. 7, 5; vi. 63, 9; x. 91, 14, etc. 2) Av. iv. 24, 4; x. 10, 2; xii. 4, 1, 
etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 4, 4. 5; 
iii. 4, 2, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xiii. 4, 
etc. 3) Av. vii. 113, 2, where the Parivṛktā, 
‘rejected wife,’ is compared with a 
Vaśā. In xii. 4 (where vaśā alternates 
with go) there is no indication that Vaśā 
means a barren cow, except perhaps 
in verse 16, on which cf. Bloomfield. 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 656, 658. The 
Brahmins there claim as their own a 
barren cow. A sūta-vaśā — i.e., a cow 
barren after once calving — is mentioned 
in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 4. 
etc. In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 
2, 2, and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 2. 
5, 2, used with Avi, Sūtā denotes a 
‘mother sheep,’ ‘ewe.’

वसति
वसति
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 ‘abode,’ ‘house.’ 1) i. 31, 15; v. 2, 6. 2) Vājasaneyī̆ Saṃhitā, xviii. 15; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 5, 4; iii. 7, 3, 3, 
etc.

वसन
वसन
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘dress.’ 1) i. 95, 7. 2) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 8, 5; 
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, ii. 15; Nirukta, 
viii. 9, etc.

वसन्त
वसन्त,
 ‘spring,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
It is regularly identified with the first of the months. See Ṛtu. 1) x. 90, 6; 161, 4. 2) Av. vi. 55, 2; viii. 2, 22; xii. 1, 36, etc.

वसावि
वसावि
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 denotes, according to 
Roth,
	2 a ‘treasure house.’ 1) x. 73, 4. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

वसिष्ठ
वसिष्ठ
 is the name of one of the most prominent priestly 
figures of Vedic tradition. The seventh Maṇḍala of the 
Rigveda is ascribed to him; this ascription is borne out by the 
fact that the Vasiṣṭhas
	1 and Vasiṣṭha
	2 are frequently mentioned 
in that Maṇḍala, besides being sometimes referred to elsewhere. 
That by the name Vasiṣṭha a definite individual is always 
meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg
	3 shows; Vasiṣṭha 
must normally mean simply ‘a Vasiṣṭha.’ But it is not 
necessary to deny that a real Vasiṣṭha existed, for one hymn
	4 
seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assist
ance to Sudās against the ten kings. 
The most important feature of Vasiṣṭha's life was apparently 
his hostility to Viśvāmitra. The latter was certainly
	5 at one 
time the Purohita (‘domestic priest’) of Sudās, but he seems 
to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Sudās' 
enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings 
against him, for the hymn of Sudās' triumph
	4 has clear 
references to the ruin Viśvāmitra brought on his allies.
	6 
Oldenberg,
	7 however, holds that the strife of Viśvāmitra and 
Vasiṣṭha is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other 
hand, Geldner
	8 is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda
	9 a 
compressed account indicating the rivalry of Śakti, Vasiṣṭha's 
son, with Viśvāmitra, the acquisition by Viśvāmitra of special 
skill in speech, and the revenge of Viśvāmitra, who secured the 
death of Śakti by Sudās' servants, an account which is more 
fully related by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,
	10 which appeared in the Śāṭyāya
naka,
	11 and to which reference seems to be made in the brief 
notices of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	12 and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa
	13 regarding Vasiṣṭha's sons having been slain, and his 
overcoming the Saudāsas. But it is important to note that no 
mention is made in these authorities of Sudās himself being 
actually opposed to Vasiṣṭha, while in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	14 
Vasiṣṭha appears as the Purohita and consecrator of Sudās 
Paijavana. Yāska
	15 recognizes Viśvāmitra as the Purohita of 
Sudās; this accords with what seems to have been the fact 
that Viśvāmitra originally held the post. Probably, however, 
with the disappearance of Sudās, Viśvāmitra recovered his 
position, whereupon Vasiṣṭha in revenge for the murder of 
his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the 
Saudāsas.
	16 
At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity 
of the Saudāsas and Vasiṣṭhas was permanent. There is 
evidence
	17 that the Bharatas had the Vasiṣṭhas as Purohitas, 
while other versions
	18 regard them as Purohitas for people 
(prajāḥ) generally. It seems that the Vasiṣṭhas were pioneers 
in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as Brahman 
priest
	19 at the sacrifice: the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	20 states that 
the Vasiṣṭhas were once the only priests to act as Brahmans, 
but that later any priest could serve as such.
	21 A rivalry 
with Jamadgni and Viśvāmitra is reported in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā.
	22 Parāśara and Śatayātu are associated with Vasiṣṭha 
in the Rigveda,
	23 being apparently, as Geldner
	24 thinks, the 
grandson and a son of Vasiṣṭha. According to Pischel,
	25 in 
another hymn,
	26 Vasiṣṭha appears as attempting to steal the 
goods of his father Varuṇa; Geldner
	27 also shows that the 
Rigveda
	28 contains a clear reference to Vasiṣṭha's being a son 
of Varuṇa and the nymph Urvaśī. Perhaps this explains the 
fact that the Vasiṣṭhas are called the Tṛtsus in one passage 
of the Rigveda;
	29 for being of miraculous parentage, Vasiṣṭha 
would need adoption into a Gotra, that of the princes whom 
he served, and to whom Agastya seems to have introduced 
him. 
There are numerous other references to Vasiṣṭha as a Ṛṣi 
in Vedic literature,
	30 in the Sūtras,
	31 and in the Epic, where 
he and Viśvāmitra fight out their rivalry.

वाकोवाक्य
वाको-वाक्य,
 ‘dialogue,’ is the name given in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 
to certain portions of the Vedic texts. In one place
	2 the 
Brahmodya is said to be a dialogue; very probably in all the 
passages the Brahmodya is meant by this term. Geldner's 
view
	3 is different: he sees in the Vākovākya an essential part 
of the Itihāsa-Purāṇa, the dialogue or dramatic element as 
opposed to the narrative portion. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 9, 20; xi. 5, 6, 8; 7, 5; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 
vii. 1, 2, 4; 2, 1; 7, 1. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 6, 9, 20. 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 291. 
Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 267; 
Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44, 
98, n. 3. It is certain that ‘logic’ is 
not meant, though Max Müller so 
renders it in his translation of the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad.

वाच्
वाच्,
 ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but 
only a few points are of other than mythological significance. 
Speech is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 divided into four kinds 
-that of men, of animals, of birds (vayāṃsi), and of small 
creeping things (kṣudraṃ sarīsṛpam). The discrimination or 
making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the 
Saṃhitās.
	2 The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments 
-Tūṇava, Vīṇā, Dundubhi
	3 — is mentioned, and in one 
Saṃhitā
	4 also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the 
Kuru-Pañcālas was especially renowned,
	5 as well as that of the 
northern country, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,
	6 so 
that men went there to study the language. On the other hand, 
barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided.
	7 
One division of speech referred to
	8 is that of the divine 
(daivī) and the human (mānuṣī), of which some specimens are 
given, such as om, the divine counterpart of tathā, and so forth. 
The Brahmin is said to know both;
	9 it seems best to regard 
the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as 
Sāyaṇa
	10 suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual 
and the hymns and that of ordinary life. 
Reference is also made to Āryan
	11 and to Brahmin
	12 speech, 
by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to 
be meant. The Vrātyas are described as speaking the language 
of the initiated (dīkṣita-vāc), though not themselves initiated 
(a-dīkṣita), but as calling that which is easy to utter (a-durukta), 
difficult to utter.
	13 This may mean that the non-Brahminical 
Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical 
tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect 
the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	7 1) iv. 1, 3, 16. There are quite dif
ferent accounts in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xiv. 5; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 11, 5. 
Oldenberg finds traces of the origin 
of the legend in Rv. viii. 100; but see 
v. Schroeder, Mysterium und Mimus, 339 
et seq.; Keith, Journal of the Royal 
Asiatic Society, 1911, 993 et seq. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 7, 3;

Saṃhitā, xxiii. 4. 4) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, loc. cit. 5) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 3, 15. 
The difficult phrase has caused some 
doubt as to the sense, for uttarāhi vāg 
vadati Kurupañcālatrā seems to mean 
‘speech in the north among the Kuru
Pañcālas,’ this version being slightly 
supported by the Kāṇva recension of 
the passage quoted by Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 12, xlii. n. 1. That 
recension, however, is not merely ob
scure, but it seems to couple the Kurus 
with the northern Mahāvṛṣas (so we 
must emend Mahāviṣeṣu), and it cannot 
be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to 
remove the difficulty by taking uttarāhi 
as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory. 
The most probable solution is that of 
Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 191, who 
takes Kurupañcālatrā to be ‘as among 
the Kuru-Pañcālas,’ which gives a good 
sense, especially when it is remembered 
that the northerners were probably the 
Uttara-Kurus in Kaśmīr, which seems 
to have been a home of Sanskrit 
(cf. Franke, Pāli und Sanskrit, 89). 6) vii. 6. 7) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 2, 1, 23.

वाजपेय
वाजपेय
 is the name of a ceremony which, according to 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and later authorities,
	2 is only per
formed by a Brahmin or a Kṣatriya. The same Brāhmaṇa
	3 
insists that this sacrifice is superior to the Rājasūya, but the 
consensus of other authorities
	4 assigns to it merely the place 
of a preliminary to the Bṛhaspatisava in the case of a priest, 
and to the Rājasūya in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha
	5 
is compelled to identify the Bṛhaspatisava with the Vājapeya. 
The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer 
is victorious. There is evidence in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	6 showing that once the festival was one which any 
Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt,
	7 indeed, goes so far as to 
compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much 
real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed 
round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into 
a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success 
of the sacrificer. In fact
	8 Eggeling seems correct in holding 
that the Vājapeya was a preliminary rite performed by a 
Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a Purohita, or by 
a king prior to his consecration. The Kuru Vājapeya was 
specially well known.

nymic of Kuśri in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 It is also the 
patronymic of the father of Naciketas in the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	2 where the name is apparently Uśant, though it is 
understood by Sāyaṇa as a participle in the sense of ‘desiring.’

been sages.
	3 They were Gotamas.

वाजिन्
वाजिन्
 in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 denotes ‘steed’ 
with reference to its swiftness and strength. In one passage
	2 
it is perhaps, as Ludwig
	3 thinks, a proper name, that of a son

वाण
वाण
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 denotes ‘instru
mental music’ according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary; 
but in the later Saṃhitās
	3 and the Brāhmaṇas
	4 a ‘harp’ or 
‘lyre’ with a hundred strings (śata-tantu), used at the Mahā
vrata ceremony. The Rigveda
	5 clearly refers to the seven 
‘notes’ (dhātu) of the instrument, which are called elsewhere
	6 
the seven Vāṇīs, unless the latter expression be taken as 
referring to the metres.

etc. 7) Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 64. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 289, 
who thinks the meaning is ‘flute’ in 
Rv. i. 85, 10, but not necessarily. Max 
Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 
138, render it ‘voice’ in i. 85, 10; 
ix. 97, 8, and ‘arrow’ in viii. 20, 8; 
ix. 50, 1, and this sense is accepted in 
Böhtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. 1 vāṇa for 
ix. 50, 1.

winds.

 (‘wind guard’) apparently means some sort of 
garment as protecting against wind in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā 
(vi. 1, 1, 3).

वातरशन
वात-रशन,
 ‘wind-girt,’ is applied to the Munis in the 
Rigveda
	1 and to the Ṛṣis in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	2 Naked 
ascetics, such as are known throughout later Indian religious 
history, are evidently meant 1) x. 136, 2. 2) i. 23, 2; 24, 4; ii. 7, 1. Weber, 
Indische Studien, 1, 78, was inclined, 
though without sufficient reason, to 
take the word as a proper name.

वातवत्|वातवन्त्
वातवन्त्
 is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa

grief, and his descendants, the Vātavatas, were less prosperous 
than the Dārteyas.

वामदेव
वाम-देव
 is credited
	1 by tradition with the authorship of 
the fourth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and he is once mentioned 
in that Maṇḍala.
	2 He is, moreover, credited with the 
authorship of the fourth hymn of the Maṇḍala by the Yajur
veda Saṃhitās.
	3 He there appears as a son of Gotama, while 
in one hymn of the fourth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda
	4 Gotama 
is mentioned as the father of the singer, and in another
	5 the 
Gotamas occur as praising Indra. In the Bṛhaddevatā
	6 two 
absurd legends are narrated of Vāmadeva. One describes 
Indra as revealing himself in the form of an eagle to the seer 
as he cooked the entrails of a dog; the other tells of his 
successful conflict with Indra, whom he sold among the 
seers. Sieg
	7 has endeavoured to trace these tales in the 
Rigveda,
	8 but without any success. Moreover, though Vāmadeva 
is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	9 and often in the Brāh
maṇas,
	10 he never figures there as a hero of these legends. 1) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 2, 1, etc. 2) iv. 16, 18. 3) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 5; Maitrāyaṇī

वारण
वारण
 in two passages of the Rigveda
	1 is taken by Roth
	2 
as an adjective with Mṛga, meaning ‘wild beast.’ But the 
sense intended must have been ‘elephant,’ the usual sense of 
Vāraṇa in the classical literature. Probably the feminine 
Vāraṇī in the Atharvaveda
	3 likewise denotes a ‘female 
elephant.’ 1) viii. 33, 8; x. 40, 4. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1c. 3) v. 14, 11.

	1 Vārdhrī-nasa
	2 is the name of an animal in 
the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the

accordance with Sāyaṇa's view.

different word).

वासःपल्पूली
वासः-पल्पूली,
 ‘washer of clothes,’ is the name of one of 
the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda.
	1 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 12; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 7, 1.

वासस्
वासस्
 is the most usual word in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 for 
‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool (cf. 
Ūrṇā); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ (vāse- 
vāya)
	3 because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms. 
The garments worn were often embroidered (cf. Peśas), and 
the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with 
gold.
	4 When the ‘giver of garments’ (vāso-dā)
	5 is mentioned 
along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are 
probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda
	6 
to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas 
thenes for his day.
	7 The Rigveda also presents epithets like 
su-vasana
	8 and su-rabhi,
	9 implying that garments were becoming 
or well-fitting. 
The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments 
-an undergarment (cf. Nīvi),
	10 a garment,
	11 and an over
garment (cf. Adhīvāsa),
	12 which was presumably a mantle, and 
for which the names Atka and Drāpi also seem to be used. 
This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments 
given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	13 which comprise a Tārpya, 
perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of 
undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban, 
after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and 
tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord 
with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a 
special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the 
case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda
	14 
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	15 There is nothing to show 
exactly what differences there were between male and female 
costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in 
either case. 
It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently 
assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis 
would wear clothing of some sort.

garments, see Mala. 1) i. 34, 1; 115, 4; 162, 16; viii. 3,

A garment of Kuśa grass is mentioned 
in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 1, 8, as 
worn by the wife of the sacrificer at 
the consecration, but it is doubtful 
whether such dresses were normally 
worn. Cf. also kausumbha-paridhāna,

वितस्ता
वितस्ता,
 the most westerly of the five rivers of the Panjab, is 
only mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 in the Nadīstuti (‘Praise of 
Rivers’).
	2 It is the Hydaspes of Alexander's historians, more 
correctly reproduced by Ptolemy as Bidaspes. The name 
appears in the Mohammedan historians corrupted to Bihat or 
Wihat, and survives in the modern Kashmīrī form of Veth. 1) x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26; cf. Kāśikā 
Vṛtti on Pāṇini, i. 4, 31. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 12; Imperial Gazetteer 
of India, 14, 160. 2) The rareness of the name in the 
Rigveda points to the Panjab not 
having been the seat of the activity of 
the greater part of the Vedic Indians.

वित्त
वित्त
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘wealth,’ ‘posses
sions.’ The earth is referred to in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad
	3 as 
full of riches (vittasya pūrṇā). The doctrine that a man's 
greatness depends on his wealth is found as early as the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	4 The striving after wealth (vittaiṣaṇā) is 
mentioned in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	5 as one of the 
things abandoned by the sage. 1) v. 42, 9; x. 34, 13. 2) Av. xii. 3, 52; Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

Brāhmaṇa,

विदथ
विदथ
 is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the 
Rigveda. According to Roth,
	1 the sense is primarily ‘order,’ 
then the concrete body which gives orders, then ‘assembly’ for 
secular
	2 or religious ends,
	3 or for war.
	4 Oldenberg
	5 once 
thought that the main idea is ‘ordinance’ (from vi-dhā, 
‘dispose,’ ‘ordain’), and thence ‘sacrifice.’ Ludwig
	6 thinks 
that the root idea is an ‘assembly,’ especially of the Maghavans 
and the Brahmins. Geldner
	7 considers that the word pri
marily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then 
‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield,
	8 on the other 
hand, insists that Vidatha refers to the ‘house’
	9 in the first 
place (from vid, ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as 
connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate, 
appears to suit all the passages. The term vidathya, once
	10 
applied to the king (samrāṭ), might seem to be against this 
view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and 
the connexion of the woman with the Vidatha, as opposed to 
the Sabhā, tells in favour
	11 of Bloomfield's explanation. That 
the word ever denotes an asylum, like the house of the 
Brahmin,
	12 as Ludwig
	13 suggests, is doubtful.

et seq. But in Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenlāndischen Gesellschaft, 54, 609-611, 
he falls back on the derivation from 
vidh, ‘worship.’ Cf. Macdonell, Vedic 
Grammar, p. 23, n. 10. 6) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 259 
et seq. 7) Vedische Studien, 1, 147; Zeitschrift

wife in the marriage ritual); i. 117,

Av. xx. 128, 1, vidathya, ‘having an 
establishment,’ seems adequate. 11) Cf. Av. vii. 38, 4; Maitrāyaṇī

Brāhmaṇa, i. 30, 27, 28, certainly does 
not show this clearly. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 177, 
who suggests that Vidatha sometimes 
means (e.g., in vidatheṣu praśastaḥ, Rv. 
ii. 27, 12) a smaller assembly than the 
Samiti. But we have no ground to be 
certain that such smaller assemblies 
ever existed at an early date either 
in India or elsewhere among Āryan 
peoples.

विदन्वन्त्भार्गव

विदेघ
विदेघ
 is the name of a man, Māthava, in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmana.
	1 It is legitimate to assume
	2 that it is a name given 
to him as king of the Videghas who are the later Videhas. 1) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. 2) Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 12, xli, n. 4; 104, n.; Weber 
Indische Studien, 1, 170; Indische Streifen, 
1, 13; Indian Literature, 134.

विदेह
विदेह
 is the name of a people who are not mentioned 
before the Brāhmaṇa period. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 
the legend of Videgha Māthava preserves clearly a tradition 
that in Videha culture came from the Brahmins of the West, 
and that Kosala was brahminized before Videha. The Videhas, 
however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king 
Janaka, who figures in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	2 as one of 
the leading patrons of the Brahman doctrine. In the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad
	3 the Videhas are joined with the Kāśis; in the list of 
peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	4 the Videhas are passed 
over, probably because, with Kosala and Kāśi, they are included 
in the term Prācyas, ‘easterners.’ Again, in the Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra
	5 it is recorded that the Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha 
kingdoms had each the one Purohita, Jala Jātūkarṇya; and 
in another passage of the same text
	6 the connexion between 
the Videha king, Para Āṭṇāra, and the Kosala king, Hiraṇya- 
nābha, is explained, while the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	7 speaks of 
Para Āṭṇāra as the Kosala king, descendant of Hiraṇyanābha. 
Another king of Videha was Namī Sāpya, mentioned in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	8 In the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda
	9 
‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the com
mentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā merely takes the adjective 
vaidehī as ‘having a splendid body’ (viśiṣṭa-deha-sambandhinī), 
and the point of a place name in the expression is not very 
obvious. The Videhas also occur in the Baudhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	10 in Brāhmaṇa-like passages. 
The boundary of Kosala and Videha was the Sadānīrā, 
probably the modern Gandak
	11 (the Kondochates of the Greek 
geographers), which, rising in Nepal, flows into the Ganges 
opposite Patna. Videha itself corresponds roughly to the 
modern Tirhut. 1) i. 4, 1, 10 et seq. 2) iii. 8, 2. Cf. iv. 2, 6; 9, 30; Śata

विद्या
विद्या
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘knowledge,’ 
especially that of the three Vedas, which are called the trayī 
vidyā, ‘the threefold knowledge,’ as early as the Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa.
	3 In a more special sense Vidyā occurs in lists of 
objects of study in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.

the expression here means is uncertain: Sāyaṇa

 denotes a disease, ‘abscesses,’ in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
According to Zimmer,
	2 it was a symptom accompanying 
Yakṣma. Later it is called Vidradhi. Ludwig
	3 compares the 
obscure Vidradha of the Rigveda,
	4 where, however, the sense of 
the word is very uncertain.

विधवा
विधवा
 denotes ‘widow’ as the ‘desolate one,’ from the 
root vidh, ‘be bereft.’ The masculine vidhava is conjectured 
by Roth
	1 in a difficult passage of the Rigveda,
	2 where the 
received text presents the apparent false concord vidhantaṃ 
vidhavām, in which he sees a metrical lengthening for vidhavam, 
‘the sacrificing widower.’ Ludwig in his version takes vidh- 
antam as equivalent to a feminine, while Delbrück
	3 prefers 
‘the worshipper and the widow.’ Possibly ‘the widower and 
the widow’ may be meant; but we know nothing of the 
mythological allusion in question, the feat being one of those 
attributed to the Aśvins, and the natural reference to Ghoṣā as 
‘husbandless’ being rendered unlikely because their feat in 
regard to her has already been mentioned a few verses before in 
the same hymn.
	4 The word Vidhavā is not of common 
occurrence.

विधु
विधु
 seems clearly to mean (as it does in the post-Vedic 
language) the ‘moon’ in a passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where it is 
alluded to as ‘wandering solitary in the midst of many’ 
(vidhuṃ dadrāṇaṃ samane bahūnām). 1) x. 55, 5; Nirukta, xiv. 18. Cf. 
Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 465. 
That the ‘many’ are the Nakṣatras is 
neither certain nor even probable. The 
stars are an adequate explanation.

विनशन
वि-नशन,
 ‘disappearance,’ is the name of the place where 
the Sarasvatī is lost in the sands of the desert. It is 
mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.

the Panjab.

विप्
विप्
 in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 refers, according to 
Roth,
	2 to the rods which form the bottom of the Soma filter, 
and on which the straining cloth is stretched. But this 
explanation is very doubtful.

विपश्चित्दृढजयन्तलौहित्य
1. Vipaścit Dṛḍha-jayanta Lauhitya (‘descendant of 
Lohita’) is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa 
(iii. 42, 1) as the pupil of Dakṣa Jayanta Lauhitya.

2. Vipaścit Śakuni-mitra Pārāśarya (‘descendant of Parā- 
śara’) is the name of a teacher, pupil of Aṣāḍha Uttara Pārā
śarya, in a Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmana (iii. 41, 1).

विपाश्
वि-पाश्
 (‘fetterless’) is the name of a river mentioned twice in 
the Rigveda.
	1 It is the modern Beās in the Panjab, the Hyphasis, 
Hypanis or Bipasis of the Greeks. Its small importance for the 
Vedic Indians is indicated by the fact that it is never mentioned 
in the earlier Vedic literature except in two hymns of the Rigveda. 
The Nirukta
	2 preserves the notice that its earlier name was 
Uruñjirā, while the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 places in the middle 
of it the Vasiṣṭha-śilāḥ. Pāṇinī
	4 mentions the name, which 
otherwise in post-Vedic literature appears as Vipāśā. This 
river has changed its course considerably since ancient times.
	5 1) iii. 33, 1. 3; iv. 30, 11. Yāska, 
Nirukta, xi. 48, sees in the latter 
passage an adjective vi-pāśin, but this 
is very improbable. See Oldenberg, 
Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 294. 2) ix. 26. The Vipāś is also mentioned 
in connexion with the Śutudrī in ii. 24; 
ix. 36. 3) i. 2, 7. 4) iv. 2, 74. 5) See Imperiat Gazctteer of India, 7,

विपृथु
विपृथु
 in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xiv. 72, 3) is 
apparently equivalent to the Vipatha, ‘rough cart,’ of other 
texts. It is probably a mere blunder.

विप्र
विप्र
 seems to mean ‘inspired singer’ (from vip, ‘quiver’) in 
the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 More especially in the later texts
	3 it 
denotes a ‘learned Brahmin.’ In the epic style it comes to 
mean no more than ‘Brahmin.’ 1) i. 129, 2. 11; 162, 7; iv. 26, 1, etc.

विप्रजनसौराकि
विप्र-जन सौराकि
 is the form of the name of Vipūjana 
given by the St. Petersburg Dictionaries for the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā.
	1 1) xxvii. 5; Weber, Indische Studien, 3, 477, gives this form, which is due to 
a misreading of the ligature for ū.

विमद
1. Vi-mada is credited by the Anukramaṇī (Index) with the 
authorship of a number of hymns of the Rigveda.
	1 This 
attribution is supported by the occurrence in this group of the 
name of the seer,
	2 and once of his family, the Vimadas,
	3 besides 
the repeated refrain
	4 vi vo made, ‘in your carouses.’ Vimada 
is occasionally alluded to later.
	5 1) Rv. x. 20-26. 2) Rv. x. 20, 10; 23, 7. 3) Rv. x. 23, 6. 4) Rv. x. 21, 1-8; 24, 1-3. 5) Av. iv. 29, 4; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
v. 5, 1.

विमद
2. Vimada is mentioned in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 
as a protégé of the Aśvins, who gave him a wife, Kamadyū. 
His identity with the preceding is improbable. 1) i. 51, 3; 112, 19; 116, 1; 117, 20; 
x. 39, 7; 65, 12, From viii. 9, 15, 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 
3, 105, has inferred that Vimada and 
Vatsa were identical.

विमुक्ता
वि-मुक्ता
 (lit., ‘secreted’), ‘pearl,’ is found in the late 
Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (v. 6).

विमोक्तृ
वि-मोक्तृ
 in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
	1 
(‘human sacrifice’) denotes one who unharnesses horses from 
the chariot, as opposed to Yoktṛ, ‘one who yokes.’ The 
corresponding verbal noun Vimocana, ‘unyoking,’ is often 
found.
	2 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 14; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 10, 1 (cf. vimoktrī,)

Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 5, 1, 5, etc.

विराज्
वि-राज्
 as a title of royalty is mentioned several times in the 
Rigveda,
	1 but only in a metaphorical sense. As an actual title, 
it is asserted in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	2 to be used by the 
Uttara Kurus and the Uttara Madras. 1) i. 188, 5; ix. 96, 18; x. 166, 1, etc.; Av. xii. 3, 11; xiv. 2, 15, etc. 2) viii. 14, 3.

 in the Atharvaveda (Paippalāda, xx. 5, 2) 
denotes a remedy for a dislocation or a sprain.

विलोहित
वि-लोहित
 is the name of a disease mentioned in the Athar
vaveda.
	1 Bloomfield
	2 thinks that ‘flow of blood from the nose’ 
is meant; Henry

विवध
वि-वध
 or Vī-vadha seems to denote a yoke borne on the 
shoulders to enable one to carry a weight. But it is found in 
the Brāhmaṇas used only metaphorically in such phrases as 
vi-vivadha,
	1 ‘with the weight unequally distributed,’ and sa- 
vīvadhatā,
	2 ‘equality of burden.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 5, 2; 
7, 3; vivīvadha, Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 
iv. 5, 19; ubhayato -vīvadha, Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xxvii. 10. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 1, 4; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 1, 10; 
sa-vīvadha-tva, v. 1, 11: xxii. 5, 7, etc.

विवयन
वि-वयन
 denotes in the Brāhmaṇas ‘plaited work,’ such as 
that used in a couch (Asandī). 
^1 Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 3; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇā, xii. 8, 3, 6. In 
the Sūtras vivāna has the same sense; 
Lāṭyāyana Srauta Sūtra, iii, 12, 1, etc.

विवाह
वि-वाह,
 ‘marriage,’ is mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 See Pati. 1) xii. 1, 24; xiv. 2, 65. The Rig
vedic term is Vahatu. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 2, 8, 7; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxv. 3; Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa, vii. 10, 4; Aitareya Brāh
maṇa, iv, 27, 5, and often in the Sūtras.

विश्
विश्
 is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In 
many passages of the Rigveda
	1 the sense of ‘settlement’ or 
‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root viś means 
to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Viśaḥ 
stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’;
	2 
so, for example, when the people of Tṛṇaskanda
	3 or of the 
Tṛtsus are mentioned.
	4 Again, in some passages
	5 the general 
sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of 
the ‘Āryan people,’
	6 or the ‘divine people,’
	7 or the ‘Dāsa 
people,’ and so on.
	8 
Sometimes,
	9 however, the Viś appear in a more special sense 
as a subdivision of the Jana or whole people. This is, how
ever, not common, for in most passages one or other of the 
senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very 
difficult to decide whether the Viś as a subdivision of the Jana 
is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a 
blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the 
word, while the relation of the Viś to the Grāma or to the 
Gotra is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda
	10 
the Viśaḥ are mentioned along with the sabandhavaḥ or relatives, 
but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor 
does the analogy of the Roman curia or the Greek  throw 
much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure 
character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at 
any rate, possible that the Viś may in some cases have been no 
more than a Gotra or clan, or different clans may sometimes 
have made up a Viś, while Grāma is more definitely, perhaps, a 
local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive.
	11 
Cf. Viśpati. 
In the later period the sense of Viś is definitely restricted in 
some cases
	12 to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic 
polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles (Kṣatra, 
Kṣatriya) and the priests (Brahman, Brāhmaṇa). For the 
position of this class, see Vaiśva. 1) iv. 4, 3; 37, 1; v. 3. 5; vi. 21, 4; 48, 8; vii. 56, 22; 61, 3, 70, 3; 104, 18; 
x. 91, 2, etc. 2) Rv. iv. 50, 8; vi. 8, 4; x. 124, 8; 
173, 6; Av. iii. 4, 1; iv. 8, 4; 22, 1. 3; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 8, 6; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, viii. 46; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 8, 2. 17; iv. 2, 1, 3; 
v. 3, 3, 12; 4, 2, 3; x. 6, 2, 1; xiii. 6, 
2, 8; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iv, 12, etc. 
Many of the passages cited under 
note 11 may also belong here, while in 
Av. iii. 4, 1, etc., reference to the cantons 
as electing a king has been seen; but 
see Rājan and cf. Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 1, 179; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 
2, 303; Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 13, 113. 3) Rv. i. 172, 3. 4) Rv. vii. 33, 6; Geldner, op. cit., 136. 5) E.g., Rv. vi. 1, 8; 26, 1; viii. 71, 11; 
manuṣo viśāḥ, vi. 14, 2; viii. 23, 13; 
mānuṣīḥ, x. 80, 6, etc. 6) Rv. x. 11, 4. 7) Rv. iii. 34, 2; Av. vi. 98, 2; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xvii. 86. 8) Rv. iv. 28, 4; vi. 25, 2; adevīḥ, 
viii. 96, 15; asiknīḥ, vii. 5, 3, etc. 9) Rv. ii. 26, 3, where it is opposed 
to jana, janman, and putrāḥ; x. 84, 4, 
where in battle viśaṃ-viśam apparently 
refers to divisions of the host cf. also 
iv. 24, 4. viśo yudhmāḥ); x. 91, 2, where 
it is opposed to gṛha and jana; Av. 
xiv. 2, 27, where gṛhebhyaḥ is followed 
by asyai sarvasyai viśe, which must mean 
a division less than a whole people. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 159, reckons 
here Rv. i. 172, 3; vii. 33, 6; ix. 7, 5; 
x. 124, 8; 173, 1; but these cases and 
many others are rather instances of 
‘subjects’ than of a division of the 
tribe such as ‘canton.’ 10) xv. 8, 2, 3, Cf. xiv. 2, 27, and 
Rv. x. 91, 2, in n. 9. 11) The Viś may have been originally 
a clan settled in one place: there is 
no passage where ‘Gotra’ would not 
probably make sense; Rv. ii. 26, 3, 
cannot be pressed unduly to distinguish 
ianman and Viś. Compare the phrase 
used of the Maruts śardhaṃ śardham, 
vrātaṃ vrātam, gaṇaṃ gaṇam, in Rv. 
v. 53. 11, where no precise sense can 
fairly be attributed to the words, though 
Zimmer sees in them a threefold division 
of the host corresponding to Jana, Viś, 
and Grāma. The rendering ‘Gau’ has 
therefore little foundation. 12) Perhaps to this sense belong the 
numerous passages in the Brāhmaṇas 
and later Saṃhitās referring to strife 
between the Viś and the Kṣatra, the 
clansmen and the chiefs, or the 
peasantry and the nobles — e.g., Tait
tirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 11, 2; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii, 1, 9; iii. 3, 10; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhita, xix. 9 and often. See also

विशर
वि-शर
 is found as the name of a disease, perhaps ‘tearing 
pains,’ in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Zimmer
	2 thinks that the pains in 
the limbs attendant on fever (Takman) are alluded to. Roth

sees in the word the name of a demon. The view of Zimmer is 
supported by the use of viśarīka, ‘rending,’ beside Balāsa in 
another passage.

विश्पति
विश्-पति
 is a word of somewhat uncertain signification, 
reflecting in this respect the nature of Viś. Zimmer holds that 
in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits 
that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one 
quoted by him
	2 being certainly indecisive. In the great 
majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the 
dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the 
householder par excellence, or possibly as the fire of the Sabhā or 
assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the 
passage of the Rigveda
	4 in which the Viśpati, as well as the 
father and the mother of a maiden,
	5 are to be lulled to sleep in 
order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may 
well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the 
Viśpati could easily be different from the father of the 
girl — e.g., a grandfather or uncle. In other passages
	6 the 
Viśpati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ (viśām), 
though here Zimmer
	7 thinks reference is made to the election 
of a king.
	8 Or again,
	7 the Viśpati is the chief of the Viś, 
probably in the sense of ‘subjects.’ 
1) Altindisches Leben, 171. 
9) E.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 1, 3, 
where Viś must clearly be the people 
or subject class, and the Viśpati their 
chief representative; we cannot from 
such a passage infer a formal office of 
Viśpati even as head of the Viś. 2) Rv. i. 37. 8. 4) vii. 55, 5 = Av. iv. 5, 6. 5) So Aufrecht, Indische Studien, 4, 
337 et seq.; Zimmer, op. cit., 308. Cf. 
Lanman, Sanskrit Reader, 370. Geldner, 
Vedische Studien, 2, 55 et seq., accepts 
the view of the Bṛhaddevatā, vi. 11 
et seq. (where see Macdonell's note), 
that the hymn refers to Vasiṣṭha's 
approaching a house as a thief! The 
interpretation does not affect the sense 
of Viśpati, which here is clearly not 
the title of a cantonal chief. Viś is 
sometimes equivalent to Sajāta; cf. 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 3, 2. 3. 6) Av. iii. 4, 1; iv. 22, 3. Perhaps Rv. 
iii. 13, 5, is so to be taken; cf. vii. 39, 2.

विश्पला
विश्पला
 is, according to the tradition in the Rigveda,
	1 the 
name of a woman to whom the Aśvins gave an iron (āyasī) 
limb to replace one lost by her in a contest. Pischel
	2 considers 
that a racing horse miraculously cured of a broken limb by the 
Aśvins is meant, but this is no more than an improbable 
conjecture. 1) i. 112, 10: 116 15; 11. 11: 118. 8; x. 39, 8. 2) Vedische Studien, 1. 171-173.

विश्वक
विश्वक,
 in the Rigveda
	1 called Kṛṣṇiya (possibly ‘son of 
Kṛṣṇa’) is a protégé of the Aśvins, who restored to him his lost 
son, Viṣṇāpu. See 2. Kṛṣṇa. 1) i. 116, 23; 117. 7; viii. 86, 1; x. 65, 12. Cf. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, 52.

विश्वकर्मन्भौवन
विश्व-कर्मन् भौवन
 (‘descendant of Bhuvana’) is the 
name of a quite mythical king. He is said in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa to have been consecrated by Kaśyapa, to whom he 
offered the earth (i.e., presumably a piece of land) as a sacrificial 
fee; in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 he performed the Sarvamedha 
(‘universal sacrifice’), and made a similar offer; in both cases 
the earth refused to be given. The story seems to contain a 
reference to the early dislike of gifts of land,
	3 but it cannot be 
stated with certainty that this is the meaning.

विश्वन्तरसौषद्मन
विश्वन्-तर सौ-षद्मन
 (‘descendant of Suṣadman’) is the 
name in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 of a prince who set aside the 
Śyāparṇas, his priests, and performed a sacrifice without their 
help, presumably with the aid of others. Rāma Mārgaveya, 
one of the Śyāparṇas, however, succeeded in inducing the king 
to reinstate the Śyāparṇas, and to give him a thousand cows. 1) vii. 27, 3, 4; 34, 7, 8. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 431-440; Eggeling, 
Sacred Books of the East, 43, 344, n.

विश्वमनस्
विश्व-मनस्
 is the name of a Ṛṣi mentioned in two passages 
of the Rigveda,
	1 and as a friend of Indra in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa.
	2 According to the Anukramaṇī (Index), he was a 
descendant of Vyaśva, and the author of certain hymns.
	3 1) viii. 23, 2; 24, 7. 2) xv. 5, 20. 3) Rv. viii. 23-26. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 106.

विश्वमानुष
विश्व-मानुष
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 may be a 
proper name, but more probably merely means ‘all mankind.’ 1) viii. 45, 22. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 187.

विश्ववार
विश्व-वार
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 apparently 
as the name of a sacrificer. 1) v. 44, 11. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138.

विश्वासामन्
विश्वा-सामन्
 is the name of a Ṛṣi, an Atreya, in the 
Rigveda.
	1 1) v. 22, 1. Cf. Oldenberg. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell- 
schaft, 42, 215.

विश्वसृज्
विश्व-सृज्
 is the name of certain mythical beings to whom, 
however, a Sattra, or sacrificial session, is ascribed in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xxv. 18, 1 et seq.).

विश्वामित्र
विश्वा-मित्र
 (‘friend of all’) is the name of a Ṛṣi who is 
mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 and to whom the third Maṇḍala is 
attributed by tradition. In one hymn
	2 which appears to be his 
own composition, he praises the rivers Vipāś (Beas) and 
Śutudrī (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of Kuśika, 
and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the Bharatas, 
whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently 
came to the rivers from the east.
	4 Anxious to cross them, they 
^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5. 
found them in high flood, but Viśvāmitra by prayer induced 
the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred 
to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda.
	5 
Curiously enough, Sāyaṇa
	6 quite misunderstands the situation: 
according to him, Viśvāmitra having obtained wealth by the 
exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pur
sued by others. Yāska's
	7 version of the tale merely seems 
to mean that the king paid Viśvāmitra to act as his Puro- 
hita, or domestic priest. For the relations of Viśvāmitra 
to Vasiṣṭha connected with their service of Sudās, see 
Vasiṣṭha. 
The Viśvāmitras are mentioned in several other passages of 
the Rigveda,
	8 and are also designated as a family by the term 
Kuśikas.
	9 
In the later literature Viśvāmitra becomes, like Vasiṣṭha, a 
mythical sage, usually
	10 mentioned in connection with Jamad- 
agni; he was Hotṛ priest at the sacrifice of Śunaḥśepa, whom 
he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of Devarāta.
	11 He 
was a protégé of Indra, with whom he had an interview 
according to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas.
	12 He is also often 
mentioned as a Ṛṣi.
	13 
In the Epic
	14 Viśvāmitra is represented as a king, who 
becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the 
Rigveda, but the Nirukta
	15 calls his father, Kuśika, a king; the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	16 refers to Śunaḥśepa as succeeding to 
the lordship of the Jahnus, as well as the ‘divine lore’ (daiva 
veda) of the Gāthins; and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	17 
mentions Viśvāmitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of 
this kingship of Viśvāmitra: it may probably be dismissed as a 
mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Viśvā
mitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even 
this is doubtful. 1) As son of Kuśika in Rv. iii. 33, 5; 
as Viśvāmitra in iii. 53, 7, 12. 2) iii. 33. Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 121, thinks the hymn too 
poetical to be a real composition of the 
reputed author. 4) So Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 152. 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 127, 128, 
takes a different view: with Roth, Zur 
Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, 90, 
he assumes that the Bharatas were 
different from the Tṛtsus, and that they 
came under Viśvāmitra from the West, 
but were defeated (see Rv. vii. 33, 6). 
But see Weber, Episches im vedischen 
Ritual, 34, n. 1; Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 136. Bloomfield, Journal of 
the American Oriental Society, 16, 41, 42, 
still defends Roth's view. 5) iii. 53, 9-11. This hymn is prob
ably later. 6) Sāyaṇa on Rv. iii. 33. 7) Nirukta, ii. 24. 8) iii. 1, 21; 18, 4; 53, 13; x. 89,

different version, which Weber, Episches 
im vedischen Ritual, 16, n. 3, prefers, 
and which omits all allusion to the 
‘lordship’ of the Jahnus. This shows 
how little stress can-be laid on this 
late tradition. 17) xxi. 12, 2.

विष
विष
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 regularly denotes ‘poison’ 
as an antidote, for which the Atharvaveda supplies spells.

विषविद्या
विष-विद्या,
 the ‘science of poison,’ is enumerated with other 
sciences in the Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra (x. 75). Cf. Vidyā.

विषाणा
विषाणा
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later^2 denotes an animal's 
‘horn.’ 1) iii. 7, 1. 2; vi. 121, 1; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, ii. 11, 10; Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, vii. 3, 2, 17. Primarily a deciduous 
horn is meant. See Whitney, Transla
tion of the Atharvaveda, 94.

विषाणका
विषाणका
 is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda.
	1 Bloom
field,
	2 however, thinks that the word may merely mean ‘horn.’ 
It is used as a remedy against the disease Vātīkāra.
	3 That 
disease is of doubtful character: Zimmer
	4 thinks that it is one 
‘caused by wounds,’ comparing the adjective a-vāta, ‘uninjured,’ 
in the Rigveda,
	5 but Bloomfield
	6 shows that ‘wind’ in the 
body is meant as causing the disease. 1) vi. 44, 3. Cf. Viṣāṇikā in Wise, 
Hindu System of Medicine, 146, perhaps the 
Asclepias geminata; Bloomfield, American 
Journal of Philology, 12, 426; Zimmer,

विषाणिन्
विषाणिन्
 occurs once in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of a tribe in 
the list of the enemies of the Tṛtsus, not as Roth
	2 thought, of 
their allies. The word seems to mean ‘having horns,’ but in what 
sense is unknown; perhaps their helmets were horn-shaped or 
ornamented with horns. They may, like their allies, the Alinas, 
Bhalānas, Śivas, and Pakthas, be reckoned as belonging to the 
tribes of the north-west. 1) vii. 18, 7. 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des 
Weda, 95; Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
126. But Zimmer, op. cit., 430, 431, 
altered his view, and Hopkins' criticism, 
overlooking this retractation, in the 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
15, 260, 261, is so far unjustified. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 173.

विषूवत्|विषूवन्त्
1. Viṣūvant denotes in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 the 
middle day in the Sattra or sacrificial session of a year's 
duration. Tilak
	3 argues that the Viṣūvant literally means the 
day when night and daylight are equal — i.e., the equinoctial 
day — and that this is the true sense of the word. But the 
theory is without probability.

विषूवत्|विषूवन्त्
2. Viṣūvant occurs in the description of the house in the 
Atharvaveda.
	1 The meaning seems to be tha ‘ridge of the 
roof.’
	2 1) ix. 3, 8. 2) Cf. Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, 151 
(who thinks it is a metaphor from the 
parting of the hair); Bloomfield, Hymns

विषूचिका
विषूचिका
 is the name of a disease mentioned in the Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā
	1 as a result of over-indulgence in Soma drinking. It 
seems clearly to be ‘dyser ery,’ or, as Wise calls it, ‘sporadic 
cholera.’ The term apparently means ‘causing evacuations in 
both directions.’ 
2) Hindu System of Medicine, 330.

Brāhmaṇa, xii. 7, 3, 2.

विष्कन्ध
वि-ष्कन्ध
 occurs several times in the Atharvaveda
	1 as the 
name of a disease. As rem dies against it a lead amulet,
	2 or 
hemp,
	3 or a salve,
	4 or the Ja giḍa plant are recommended for 
use.
	5 Weber
	6 suggests that the disease meant is ‘rheumatism,’ 
because it draws the shoulders apart (vi-skandha), but Bloom
field
	7 thinks that it is rather the name of a demon, like the 
Rigvedic Vyaṃśa
	8 and Vigrīva,
	9 both of which are similarly 
formed and are names of demons. Possibly Karśapha and 
Viśapha mentioned in one hymn
	10 are plants used to cure the 
disease. 1) i. 16, 3; ii. 4, 1 et seq.; iii. 9, 
2. 6; iv. 9, 5; xix. 34, 5. It is also 
found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3,

340. Roth, St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
s.v., thinks demons are meant: this 
seems the more probable view.

विष्टारिन्
वि-ष्टारिन्
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 denotes a special sort of Odana 
or porridge. 1) iv. 34, 1 et seq. According to 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 206, the designation ‘outspread’ 
is due to the fact that the rice mess 
was kneaded into furrows and juices 
(rasa) were poured into them. See 
Kauśika Sūtra, lxvi. 6.

विष्ठाव्राजिन्
विष्ठा-व्राजिन्
 is a word of doubtful significance in the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 According to Sāyaṇa, it means ‘remaining 
in one and the same place’; if this is right, the rendering of the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary and of Böhtlingk's Dictionary, ‘one 
whose herd is stationary,’ seems legitimate. But, as Eggeling
	2 
points out, the Kāṇva recension of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in 
another passage
	3 seems to treat the word as denoting a disease: 
thus Viṣṭhāvrājin may mean ‘one afflicted by dysentery.’ 1) v. 1, 12. 2) Sacred Books of the East, 41, 123, n. 1. 3) Ibid., 50, n. 1.

विष्णापु
विष्णापु
 is the son of Viśvaka in the Rigveda.
	1 When lost 
he was restored to his father by the Aśvins. 1) i. 116, 23; 117, 7; viii. 86, 3; x. 65, 12.

विष्फुलिङ्ग
विष्फुलिङ्ग
 denotes a ‘spark’ of fire in the Upaniṣads.
	1 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii, 1, 23; 
vi. 1, 12; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, iii. 3; 
iv. 20, etc. Cf. viṣpuliṅgaka, ‘scatter
ing sparks of fire,’ in Rv. i. 191, 12 
(Sāyaṇa, ‘a tongue of fire,’ or 
‘sparrow’).

विष्वक्सेन
विष्वक्-सेन
 is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Nārada, 
mentioned in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the 
Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa.

विसल्य
विसल्य
 
	1 and Visalyaka
	2 are names of a disease in the 
Atharvaveda. Since Shaṅkar Paṇḍit's reciters
	3 pronounced 
the word as Visalpaka in all the passages, that should probably 
be adopted as the right reading.
	4 Some sort of pain is meant, 
perhaps ‘neuralgia,’ in connexion with fever. 1) ix. 8, 20. 2) vi. 127, 1 et seq.; ix. 8, 2. 5; 
xix. 44, 2. 3) See Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 601; Whitney, Translation of 
the Atharvaveda, 376. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 378, 384. 4) The commentator Sāyaṇa on vi. 127 
reads visalpakaḥ, and on xix. 44, 2, 
visarpakaḥ.

विस्रस्
वि-स्रस्
 denotes the ‘decay’ of old age, ‘decrepitude,’ 
‘senility.’
	1 1) Av. xix. 34, 3, where Bohtlingk, 
Dictionary, s.v., suggests for visrasas the 
emendation visruhas (cf. Rv. vi. 7, 6);

Aitareya Āraṇyaka, ii. 3, 7; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, viii. 20, 7; Kāthaka Upani
ṣad, vi. 4.

विहल्ह
विहल्ह
 is found in the Atharvaveda
	1 apparently as the name 
of a plant. The forms Vihaṃla and Vihahla occur as variants. 1) vi. 16, 2. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 72.

वीणा
वीणा
 in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 denotes a 
‘lute.’ A Vīṇā-vāda, ‘lute-player,’ is included in the list of 
victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajur
veda,
	3 and is also mentioned elsewhere.
	4 The Aitareya Āraṇ
yaka,
	5 which states that the instrument was once covered with 
a hairy skin, enumerates its parts as Śiras, ‘head’ (i.e., neck); 
Udara, ‘cavity’; Ambhaṇa, ‘sounding board’; Tantra, ‘string’; 
and Vādana, ‘plectrum.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	6 the 
Uttaramandrā is either a tune or a kind of lute. Cf. Vāṇa. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 4, 1;

वीणावाद
वीणा-वाद
 See Vīṇā.

वीतहव्य
वीत-हव्य
 is the name of a prince who is mentioned in the 
Rigveda
	1 along with Bharadvāja, and as a contemporary of 
Sudās,
	2 though in both passages it is possible to understand the 
word as a mere adjective. In the Atharvaveda
	3 Vītahavya 
appears as connected with Jamadagni and Asita, but it is clear 
that the legend there has no value. It is possible, though not 
certain, that he was a king of the Sṛṇjayas.
	4 In the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās
	5 a Vītahavya Śrāyasa appears as a king: he may be 
identical with the Vītahavya of the Rigveda, or belong to the 
same line. Cf. Vaitahavya. 1) vi. 15, 2. 3. 2) vii. 19, 3. 3) vi. 137, 1. 4) Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 
105. 5) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 6, 5, 3; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxii. 3; Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 16, 3. Ibid., ix. 1, 9, 
he is represented as being niruddha, 
apparently in ‘banishment’; but the 
scholiast explains him as not a king, 
but a Ṛṣi, which is quite possible. 
Cf. Oldenberg, Zeitschrift der Deutschen 
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 42, 212; 
Buddha, 405.

वीर
वीर
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘man’ as the strong 
and heroic. Collectively in the singular
	3 the word denotes 
‘male offspring,’ an object of great desire (cf. Putra) to the 
Vedic Indian. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	4 gives a list of 
eight Vīras of the king, constituting his supporters and 
entourage. 1) i. 18, 4; 114, 8; iv. 29, 2; v. 20, 4; 
61, 5, etc. 2) Av. ii. 26, 4; iii. 5, 8, etc. 3) Rv. ii. 32, 4; iii. 4, 9; 36, 10; 
vii. 34, 20, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

his son, Purohita, Mahiṣī, Sūta, Grā- 
maṇī, Kṣattṛ, and Saṃgrahītṛ. See 
Ratnin.

वीरण
वीरण
 is the form in the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (v. 2) of 
the name of the plant Vīriṇa.

वीरहत्या
वीर-हत्या,
 ‘murder of a man,’ is one of the crimes referred 
to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	1 The Vīra-han, ‘man-slayer,’ 
is often mentioned in the older texts.
	2 Cf. Vaira. 1) x. 40. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 2, 1; ii. 2,

12, etc.

वीरिण
वीरिण
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes a kind of grass 
(Andropogon muricatus). See Vairiṇa. 1) xiii. 8, 1, 15. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 70.

वीरुध्
वीरुध्
 means ‘plant’ in the Rigveda,
	1 and later.
	2 As con
trasted with Oṣadhi, it denotes the inferior order of plants, but 
it often has practically the same sense as Oṣadhi. 1) i. 67, 9; 141, 4; ii. 1, 14; 35, 8, 
etc. 2) Av. i. 32, 3; 34, 1; ii. 7, 1; v. 4, 1; 
xix. 35, 4, etc. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 57.

वृक
1. Vṛka, ‘wolf,’ is mentioned frequently in the Rigveda,
	1 
and also later.
	2 It was an enemy of sheep
	3 and of calves,
	4 
being dangerous even to men.
	5 Its colour is stated to be 
reddish (aruṇa).
	6 The ‘she-wolf,’ Vṛkī, is also mentioned several 
times in the Rigveda.
	7 1) i. 42, 2; 105, 7; 116, 14; ii. 29, 6; 
vi. 51, 14; vii. 38, 7, etc. 2) Av. vii. 95, 2; xii. 1, 49; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xii. 10; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,

ing sheep,’ x. 66, 8. 4) Av. xii. 4. 7. 5) Rv. i. 105, 11, 18; ii. 29, 6. In 
Nirukta, v. 21, Roth, St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v. 16, sees the sense of 
‘dog,’ which seems needless. Cf. Nirukta, 
Erlāuterungen, 67. 6) Rv. i. 105, 18. 7) i. 116, 16; 117, 17; 183, 4; vi. 51, 6; 
x. 127, 6. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 81; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 14.

वृक
2. Vṛka in two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 denotes ‘plough.’ 1) i. 117, 21; viii. 22, 6; Nirukta, v. 26.

वृकद्वरस्
वृक-द्वरस्
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 which 
Ludwig
	2 interprets as referring to a battle against Vṛkadvaras, 
king of the Śaṇḍikas. But this is quite uncertain. Roth
	3 and 
Oldenberg
	4 incline to read vṛkadhvaras. Hillebrandt
	5 suggests 
Iranian connections, but without any clear reason. 1) ii. 30, 4. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153;

वृक्ष
वृक्ष
 is the ordinary term for tree' in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 In the Atharvaveda
	3 it denotes the coffin made from a 
tree, no doubt by hollowing it out. The Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	4 
refers to the portent of a tree secreting blood. 1) i. 164, 20. 22; ii. 14, 2; 39, 1; 
iv. 20, 5; v. 78, 6, etc. 2) Av. i. 14, 1; ii. 12, 3; vi. 45, 1;

v. 83, with Macdonell's note (d). 4) Indische Studien, 1, 40, and cf. Journal 
of the American Oriental Society, 15, 214.

वृक्षसर्पी
वृक्ष-सर्पी,
 ‘tree-creeper,’ is the name of a species of worm 
or female serpent in the Atharvaveda.
	1 1) ix. 2, 22. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

वृक्ष्य
वृक्ष्य
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 1, 1, 10) denotes the 
‘fruit of a tree.’

वृचया
वृचया
 is referred to once in the Rigveda
	1 as the spouse 
given by the Aśvins to Kakṣīvant. 1) i. 51, 3. Cf. Pischel, Vedische 
Studien, 1, 3, 203, who distinguishes 
two Kakṣīvants, but without sufficient 
reason, since i. 116, 17, must clearly 
refer to Vṛcayā.

वृचीवत्|वृचीवन्त्
वृचीवन्त्
 is the name of a tribe referred to once in the 
Rigveda,
	1 where it is clearly stated that the Sṛñjaya king, 
Daivavāta, conquered the Turvaśa king and the Vṛcīvants. 
Zimmer
	2 thinks that the Vṛcīvants and the Turvaśa people 
should be identified, but this is both unnecessary and improb
able; it is adequate to assume that they were allied against
	3 
the Sṛñjayas. The Vṛcīvants appear again only in the strange 
legend in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	4 according to which the 
Jahnus and the Vṛcīvants contended for sovereignty, Viśvā- 
mitra, the Jahnu king, winning it by his knowledge of a 
certain rite. See also Hariyūpīyā. 1) vi. 27, 5 et seq. 2) Altindisches Leben, 124. 3) Oldenberg, Buddha, 404; Ludwig, 
Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 153: 
Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 105. 4) xxi. 12, 2.

वृजन
वृजन,
 according to Roth,
	1 denotes in several passages of 
the Rigveda
	2 the ‘settlement’ or ‘village,’ the German ‘Mark’ 
and its inhabitants. Zimmer,
	3 accepting this view, sees in 
Vṛjana the ‘secure abode’ (kṣiti dhruvā) where the clan lives,
	4 
the clan itself as a village community (like Grāma), and the 
clan in war.
	5 Geldner,
	6 on the other hand, takes the literal 
sense of Vṛjana ṭo be ‘net,’ developing all the other senses 
from that idea, but the traditional view seems more natural. 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. 2) i. 51, 15, 73, 2; 91, 21; 105, 19; 
128, 7; 165, 15; 166, 14, etc. 3) Altindisches Leben, 142, 159, 161. 4) Rv. i. 51, 15; 73, 2 (cf. i. 73, 4). 5) Rv. vii. 32, 27; x. 42, 10. 6) Vedische Studien, 1, 139 et seq.

वृत्रघ्न
वृत्र-घ्न
 occurs in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 
where in a Gāthā reciting the prowess of Bharata it is said that 
he bound horses on the Yamunā (Jumna) and Gaṅgā (Ganges) 
Vṛtraghne, which Sāyaṇa renders ‘at Vṛtraghna,’ as the name 
of a place. Roth,
	2 however, seems right in interpreting the 
form as a dative, ‘for the slayer of Vṛtra’ — i.e., Indra. 1) viii. 23, 5. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. Aufrecht, Aitarecya Brāhmaṇa, 425.

वृत्रशङ्कु
वृत्र-शङ्कु,
 literally ‘Vṛtra-peg,’ found in one passage of 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 is said by the scholiast on the 
Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra
	2 to denote a stone pillar. This 
improbable interpretation is based on another passage in the 
same Brāhmaṇa.
	3 1) xiii. 8, 4, 1. 2) xxi. 3, 31. 3) iv. 2, 5, 15. Cf. Eggeling. Sacred 
Books of the East, 44, 437, n. 1.

वृद्धद्युम्नआभिप्रतारिण
वृद्ध-द्युम्न आभिप्रतारिण
 (‘descendant of Abhipra
tārin’) is the name of a prince (rājanya) in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa (iii. 48, 9), where his priest, Śucivṛkṣa Gaupalāyana, is 
praised. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xv, 16, 10-13), on 
the contrary, he is said to have erred in the sacrifice, when a 
Brahmin prophesied that the result would be the expulsion of 
the Kurus from Kurukṣetra, an event which actually came 
to pass.

वृद्धवाशिनी
वृद्ध-वाशिनी
 in the Nirukta (v. 21) denotes the ‘female 
jackal.’ 
^1. Vṛśa. See Vṛṣa.

वृशजान
2. Vṛśa Jāna (‘descendant of Jana’) is the name of a famous 
Purohita, who was unfortunate enough, while with his royal 
master, Tryaruṇa, to see a boy killed by the chariot which the 
king drove too fast. He thereupon recalled the boy to life. 
The story is told briefly in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 the 
Śāṭyāyanaka,
	2 the Tāṇḍaka,
	3 was also narrated in the Bhāllavi 
Brāhmaṇa,
	4 and is preserved in the Bṛhaddevatā,
	5 Sieg
	6 has 
endeavoured to trace the story in part in the Rigveda,
	7 but 
there is a consensus of opinion
	8 against the correctness of 
such a view. 1) xiii. 3, 12. 2) See Sāyaṇa on Rv. v. 2, and the 
Jaiminīya version in the Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 18, 20. 3) See Sāyaṇa, loc. cit. 4) Referred to in the Bṛhaddevatā, 
v. 23, apparently as cited in the Nidāna. 
The passage is not in the extant text 
of the Nidāna Sūtra. See Sieg. Die 
Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda 65, n. 5. 5) v. 14 et seq., where see Macdonell's 
notes. 6) Op, cit., 64-76. 7) v. 2. 8) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig

hand, Geldner, Festgruss an Roth, 192, 
supports the tradition. Cf. Weber. 
Indische Studien, 10, 32.

वृश्चिक
वृश्चिक
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 denote 
‘scorpion.’ Its poison was feared
	3 like that of serpents. It 
is described as lying torpid in the earth during winter.

वृष
वृष
 is the name of a plant of some kind in the Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā.
	1 Later the Gendarussa vulgaris is so styled. Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā
	2 has Vṛśa, which Böhtlingk
	3 takes to mean a 
small animal, a quite possible sense. Cf. Yevāṣa. 1) xxx. 1. 2) iv. 8, 1. 3) Dictionary, General Inden to 
Supplements, 376.

वृषखादि
वृष-खादि
 is used as an epithet of the Maruts in the 
Rigveda.
	1 The sense is doubtful: Bollensen
	2 thought the 
expression referred to the wearing of rings in the ears; Max 
Müller
	3 renders it ‘strong rings,’ comparing the later Cakra or 
discus. 1) i. 64, 10. 2) Orient und Occident, 2, 461, n. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 32, 107, 120, 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 263.

वृषगण
वृष-गण
 is the name of a family of singers mentioned in 
one passage of the Rigveda.
	1 1) ix. 97, 8. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 132.

वृषणश्व
वृषण्-अश्व
 is the name of a man referred to in the Rigveda,
	1 
where Indra is called Menā, perhaps his ‘wife’ or ‘daughter.’ 
The same legend is alluded to in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,
	2 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 the Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	4 and the 
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,
	5 but it is clear that all of these texts had 
no real tradition of what was referred to. 1) i. 51, 13. 2) ii. 79 (Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 18, 37). 3) iii. 3, 4, 18. 4) i. 1, 16. 5) i. 12, 3. 
Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 
26, 81, n. 2.

वृषदंश
वृष-दंश,
 ‘strong-toothed,’ is the name of the cat in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 where it figures as a victim at the Aśva
medha (‘horse sacrifice’). It also appears in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa;
	2 the fact that the sneeze of the cat is here referred 
to renders it likely that the animal was already tamed. Geldner
	3 
sees a house cat in the animal alluded to in a hymn of the 
Atharvaveda
	4 by a set of curious epithets, including vṛṣadatī, 
‘strong-toothed,’ but Whitney
	5 decisively rejects the idea that 
the hymn refers to the domestic cat. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 21, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 31. 2) viii. 2, 2. 3) Vedische Studien, 1, 313-315. 4) i. 18. 5) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 19,

वृषन्
वृषन्
 in two passages of the Rigveda
	1 seems to denote a 
man, with the patronymic Pāthya in one of them. 1) i. 36, 10; vi. 16, 14. 15. Cf. Max 
Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 
152, 153; Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 104.

वृषभ
वृषभ
 regularly denotes a ‘bull’ in the Rigveda,
	1 but 
usually in a metaphorical sense. 1) i. 94, 10; 160, 3; vi. 46, 4; of 
Parjanya, vii. 101, 1, 6, etc. Roth 
renders vrsabhānna, ii. 16, 5, ‘eating 
strong food’; but the literal sense, 
‘whose food is bulls,’ will answer. 
Cf. Māṃsa.

वृषल
वृषल
 in the dicing hymn of the Rigveda
	1 denotes an ‘out
cast’; the same sense appears in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	2 
where the touch of either a Vṛṣala or a Vṛṣalī is to be avoided. 1) x. 34, 11. Cf. Nirukta, iii. 16. 2) vi. 4, 12 Mādhyaṃdina.

वृषशुष्मवातावत
वृष-शुष्म वातावत
 (‘descendant of Vātāvant’) Jātū- 
karṇya is the name of a priest in the Brāhmaṇas of the 
Rigveda.
	1 Vṛṣaśuṣma in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 is probably 
intended for the same name. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 29, 1; 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, ii. 9 (with a varia 
lectio Vādhāvata: Indische Studien, 1, 
215, n. 1). 2) Indische Studien, 4, 373.

वृषारव
वृषा-रव,
 ‘roaring like a bull,’ is the name of some animal 
in the Rigveda.
	1 In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 the word 
occurs in the dual, meaning perhaps ‘mallet’ or ‘drumstick.’ 1) x. 146, 2 = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 5, 5, 6. 2) xii. 5, 2, 7. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 426: Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 
90.

वृष्टि
वृष्टि
 is the regular word for ‘rain’ in the Rigveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 1) i. 116, 12; ii. 5, 6, etc. 2) Av. iii. 31, 11; vi. 22, 3, etc.

वृष्टिहव्य
वृष्टि-हव्य
 is in the Rigveda
	1 the name of a Ṛṣi, whose sons 
were the Upastutas. 1) x. 115, 9. Cf. Max Mūller, Sacred 
Books of the East, 32, 152, 153; Ludwig, 
Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 108, 
109.

वेणु
वेणु
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘reed’ of 
bamboo, It is described in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 as 
‘hollow’ (su-ṣira). In the Rigveda
	4 it occurs only in a 
Vālakhilya hymn in a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’), where Roth
	5 
thinks that ‘flutes of reed’ are meant, a sense which Veṇu has 
in the later texts. The Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	6 couples Veṇu 
with Sasya, stating that they ripen in Vasanta, ‘spring.’ 
Apparently bamboo reeds are meant.

वेतस
वेतस
 is the name of the water plant Calamus Rotang, or a 
similar reed, in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 It is called ‘golden’ 
(hiraṇyaya) and ‘water-born’ (apsuja).

वेतसु
वेतसु
 is a name occurring in the singular in two passages 
of the Rigveda
	1 and once in the plural.
	2 It seems that he was 
defeated by Indra, but there is no reason to assume that he 
was a demon. Zimmer
	3 thinks that the Vetasus were probably 
the tribe of which Daśadyu was a member, and that they 
defeated the Tugras. The passages are too obscure to render 
any version probable. 1) vi. 20, 8; 26, 4. 2) x. 49, 4. 3) Altindisches Leben, 128. Cf. Kaegi,

वेतस्वत्|वेतस्वन्त्
वेतस्वन्त्,
 ‘abounding in reeds,’ is the name of a place in 
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 not, as Weber
	2 once took it, a 
part of the name of Ekayāvan Gāṃdama. 1) xxi. 14, 20. 2) Indische Studien, 1, 32. Cf. Hopkins, 
Transactions of the Connecticut Academy 
of Arts and Sciences, 15, 69.

वेद
वेद
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘sacred lore.’ 
In the plural
	3 it more definitely refers to the Vedas of the Ṛc, 
Yajus, and Sāman. Cf. Vidyā. 1) Av. vii. 54, 2; x. 8, 17; xv. 3, 7. 2) Traya, ‘threefold,’ Śatapatha Brāh

Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 3, 7; xii. 3, 4, 11, etc. 
In the Brāhmaṇas the word, no doubt, 
has normally the sense of the extant 
collections, which appear under their 
accepted titles, Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, 
Sāmaveda, in the Āraṇyakas.

वेदाङ्ग
वेदाङ्ग,
 as the name of a text subsidiary to the study of 
the Rigveda, is first found in the Nirukta
	1 and the Rigveda 
Prātiśākhya.
	2 1) i. 20. 2) xii. 40. 
Cf. Roth, Nirukta, xv. et seq.; Weber, 
Indische Studien, 9, 42.

वेन
1. Vena occurs in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 as a generous 
patron. Pṛthavāna, found in the same passage, may or may 
not be another name of his, and Pārthya in the following 
stanza of the hymn is perhaps his patronymic. 1) x. 93, 14. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 166.

वेन
2. Vena in the Rigveda
	1 is thought by Tilak
	2 to be the 
planet Venus. But this is certainly impossible. 1) x. 123. 2) Oriea, 163 et seq 
Cf. Whitney, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 16, xciv.

वेश
1. Veśa is a term of somewhat doubtful sense, apparently 
denoting ‘vassal,’ ‘tenant,’ in a few passages,
	1 and, according 
to Roth,
	2 ‘dependent neighbour.’ 1) Rv. iv. 3, 13; v. 85, 7; possibly 
x. 49, 5; but cf. 2. Veśa; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xii. 5 (veśatva.); xxxi. 12; 
xxxii. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, Kāṇva, 
ii. 5, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, i. 4, 8; 
ii. 3, 7; iv. 1, 13. Cf. Weber, Indische 
Studien, 13, 204, who takes veśas in Av. 
ii. 32, 5, where pari-veśas also occurs in 
the same sense, and compares vaiśya 
in Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 7, 1, as 
meaning ‘servitude’ 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1, 
veśa, and veśatva. Cf. Whitney, Trans
lation of the Atharvaveda, 75, who 
seems inclined to read veṣas in Av. 
ii. 32, 5; but Weber's explanation of 
the origin of the sense of ‘servant’ is 
adequate. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 
135, n. 4, sees in Veśa either a neigh
bour or a member of the same village 
community. Cf. Sajāta.

वेश
2. Veśa may be a proper name in two passages of the 
Rigveda;
	1 if so, it is quite uncertain whether a demon is 
meant or not. 1) ii. 13, 8; x. 49, 5. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 152, 164.

वेशन्ता
वेशन्ता,
 
	1 Veśantī,
	2 Veśāntā,
	3 all denote a ‘pond’ or ‘tank.’ 
Cf. Vaiśanta. 1) Av. xi. 6, 10; xx. 128, 8, 9; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. 2) Av. i. 3, 7. 3) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 11.

वेशी
वेशी
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 seems to denote a 
‘needle.’ 1) vii. 18, 17. Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 15, 264, n.

वेश्मन्
वेश्मन्,
 ‘house,’ occurs in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 It 
denotes the house as the place where a man is ‘settled’ (viś). 1) x. 107, 10; 146, 3. 2) Av. v. 17, 13; ix. 6, 30; Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa, viii. 24, 6, etc. In Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 2, 14, the single 
house (eka-veśman) of the king is con
trasted with the numerous dwellings 
of the people.

वेश्य
वेश्य
 in two passages of the Rigveda (iv. 26, 3; vi. 61, 14) 
seems to denote the relation of ‘dependence’ rather than 
‘neighbourhood.’ Cf. 1. Veśa.

वेष्क
वेष्क
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (iii. 8, 1, 15) denotes the 
‘noose’ for strangling the sacrificial animal. See Bleṣka.

वेहत्
वेहत्
 seems to mean a ‘cow that miscarries.’ It is 
mentioned in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) xii. 4, 37 et seq. In iii. 23, 1, a 
woman is called vehat. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xviii. 27; 
xxiv. 1, etc.; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 
5, 3, etc. In Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
xii. 4, 4, 6, Eggeling, Sacred Books of 
the East, 44, 195, adopts the sense ‘a 
cow desiring the bull.’ But cf. Whitney, 
Translation of the Atharvaveda, 127.

वैकर्ण
वैकर्ण
 occurs but once in the Rigveda
	1 in the description 
of the Dāśarājña, where Sudās is stated to have overthrown the 
twenty-one tribes (janān) of the kings or folk of the two 
Vaikarṇas. Zimmer
	2 conjectures that they were a joint 
people, the Kuru-Krivis: this is quite possible, and even 
probable. Vikarṇa as the name of a people is found in the 
Mahābhārata,
	3 and a lexicographer
	4 places the Vikarṇas in 
Kaśmīr, a reminiscence probably of a real settlement of the 
Kurus in that country. Cf. Uttara Kuru. 1) vii. 18, 11. 2) Altindisches Leben, 103. 3) vi. 2105. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 
Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 15, 261 et seq., who sees 
in Vaikarṇau the two Vaikarṇa kings.

वैखानस
वैखानस
 is the name of a mythical group of Ṛṣis who are 
said in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 to have been slain at Muni- 
maraṇa by Rahasyu Devamalimluc, and who are mentioned 
in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka also.
	2 An individual Vaikhānasa is 
Puruhanman.
	3 1) xiv. 4, 7. 2) i. 23, 3 (Indische Studien, 1, 78). 3) xiv. 9, 29.

वैजान
वैजान,
 ‘descendant of Vijāna,’ is Sāyaṇa's version of the 
patronymic of Vṛśa in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The real 
reading is vai Jānaḥ, as pointed out by Weber.

वैट्टभटीपुत्र
वैट्टभटी-पुत्र
 is the name in the Kāṇva recension of the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 5, 2) of a teacher, a pupil of 
Kāraśakeyīputra, Cf. Vaidabhṛtīputra.

वैडव
वैडव,
 ‘descendant of Vīḍu,’ is the patronymic of a Vaisiṣṭha 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa (xi. 8, 14), where he is said to 
have been the seer of a Sāman or Chant.

maṇa.
	1 1) Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 40; Omina und Portenta, 325 et seq.

वैतरण
वैतरण
 occurs once in the Rigveda.
	1 Roth
	2 thinks the 
word is a patronymic, but it seems rather
	3 to be an adjective in 
the sense of ‘belonging to Vitaraṇa’ used of Agni, like Agni of 
Bharata or of Vadhryaśva. 1) x. 61, 17. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. 3) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig.

वैतहव्य
वैतहव्य,
 ‘descendant of Vītahavya,’ is the name of a 
family who are said in the Atharvaveda
	1 to have come to ruin 
because they devoured a Brahmin's cow. They are said to be 
Sṛñjayas, but as the exact form of the legend here referred to 
does not occur elsewhere, its authenticity is open to some 
doubt.
	2 According to Zimmer,
	3 Vaitahavya is a mere epithet 
of the Sṛñjayas, but this is not probable
	4 in view of the 
existence of a Vītahavya. 1) v. 18, 10. 11; 19, 1. 2) Moomfield, Hymns of the Atharva-

वैदथिन
वैदथिन,
 ‘descendant of Vidathin,’ is the patronymic of 
Ṛjiśvan in the Rigveda (iv. 16, 11; v. 29, 13).

वैददश्वि
वैदद्-अश्वि,
 ‘descendant of Vidadaśva,’ is the patronymic of 
Taranta in the Rigveda.
	1 In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	2 and 
the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	3 the Vaidadaśvis are Taranta and 
Purumīlha. The latter is not a Vaidadaśvi in the Rigveda, a 
clear sign of the worthlessness of the legends relative to these 
two men in the Brāhmaṇas. 1) v. 61, 10. 2) xiii. 7, 12. Cf. Śāṭyāyanaka in 
Sāyaṇa on Rv. ix. 58, 3. 3) i. 151; iii. 139, where Vaitadaśvi

वैर
वैर
 
	1 and Vaira-deya
	2 seem to have in the later Saṃhitās 
and the Brāhmaṇas the definite and technical sense of ‘wergeld,’ 
the money to be paid for killing a man as a compensation to 
his relatives. This view is borne out by the Sūtras of Āpa
stamba
	3 and Baudhāyana.
	4 Both prescribe the scale of 
1,000 cows for a Kṣatriya,
	5 100 for a Vaiśya, 10 for a Śūdra, 
and a bull over and above in each case. Āpastamba leaves the 
destination of the payment vague, but Baudhāyana assigns it 
to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were 
intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the 
king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to 
abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The Āpa
stamba Sūtra
	6 allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but 
the Gautama Sūtra
	7 puts them on a level with men of the 
Śūdra caste only, except in one special case. The payment is 
made for the purpose of vaira-yātana or vaira-niryātana, ‘requital 
of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’ 
The Rigveda
	8 preserves, also, the important notice that a 
man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet 
śata-dāya, ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the 
values varied, but in the case of Śunaḥśepa the amount is a 
hundred (cows) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	9 In the Yajurveda 
Saṃhitās
	10 śata-dāya again appears. 
The fixing of the price shows that already public opinion, and 
perhaps the royal authority, was in Rigvedic times diminishing 
the sphere of private revenge; on the other hand, the existence 
of the system shows how weak was the criminal authority of 
the king (cf. Dharma).

वैश्य
वैश्य
 denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the 
subject class, distinct from the ruling noble (Kṣatriya) and the 
Brāhmaṇa, the higher strata of the Āryan community on the 
one side, and from the aboriginal Śūdra on the other. The 
name is first found in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) in 
the Rigveda,
	1 and then frequently from the Atharvaveda
	2 
onwards,
	3 sometimes in the form of Viśya.
	4 
The Vaiśya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature, 
which has much to say of Kṣatriya and Brahmin. His 
characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa
	5 in the adjectives anyasya bali-kṛt, ‘tributary to another’; 
anyasyādya, ‘to be lived upon by another’; and yathākāma- 
jyeyaḥ, ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed 
by the king (Rājan), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the 
right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more 
and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the 
Vaiśyas. But the Vaiśya was not a slave: he could not be 
killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring 
risk and the payment of a wergeld (Vaira), which even in the 
Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vaiśya. Moreover, 
though the Vaiśya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he 
cannot be said to have been without property in his land. 
Hopkins
	6 thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be 
a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this 
is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove 
the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on 
the people, as the tales of exiled kings show. 
On the other hand, Hopkins
	7 is clearly right in holding that 
the Vaiśya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society 
was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon 
an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell
	8 urged. 
Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were 
agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were 
so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a 
Vaiśya in life
	9 and in death.
	10 It would be absurd to suppose 
that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and com
merce (cf. Paṇi, Vaṇij), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture 
must have been their normal occupations. 
In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force 
under the Kṣatriya leaders (see Kṣatriya). But like the 
Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of 
the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either 
body armour or offensive weapons. 
That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the 
day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to 
that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the 
evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic 
achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition 
was, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	11 to become a 
Grāmaṇī, or village headman, a post probably conferred by the 
king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many. 
It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vaiśya could attain to 
nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be 
quoted in support of such a view,
	12 though such changes of 
status may have taken place (see Kṣatriya and Varṇa). 
It is denied by Fick
	13 that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and 
the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that 
a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and 
which follows a hereditary occupation (cf. Varṇa). But it 
would be wrong
	14 to suppose that the term Vaiśya was merely 
applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or 
priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite 
class which was separate from the other classes, and properly 
to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were 
differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences 
among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny 
the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other 
two are such, though at the present day things are different.

 ‘descendant of Viṣṭhapura,’ is the name of 
a teacher in the first two Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) of the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad in the Mādhyaṃdina recension (ii. 5, 
20; iv. 5, 25). He was a pupil of Śāṇḍilya and Rauhiṇāyana.

व्यच्छ|व्यछ
व्यछ
 in go-vyacha, the name of one of the victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,
	1 is of 
uncertain signification. According to Sāyaṇa,
	2 the compound 
denotes a ‘driver out of cows.’ Perhaps it means a ‘tormentor 
of cows,’ as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. Weber
	3 
renders it as ‘knacker of cows,’ Eggeling as ‘one who 
approaches cows.’

व्यद्वर
व्य्-अद्वर,
 
	1 Vy-advarī,
	2 are the names of a ‘gnawing’ (ad, 
‘eat’) animal in the Atharvaveda and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. 
Cf. also Vyadhvara, which the St. Petersburg Dictionary 
would read throughout. 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 4, 1, 27. 
Cf. Av. vi. 50, 2. 2) Av. iii. 28, 2, where a worm is 
certainly not meant.

व्यध्वर
व्यध्वर,
 ‘perforating,’ designates a worm in one passage 
of the Atharvaveda,
	1 where there seems to be no good reason 
to alter the reading to Vyadvara, though Whitney
	2 thinks that 
it may rather be connected with vi-adhvan
	3 than with the root 
vyadh, ‘pierce.’
	4 The term occurs with Maśaka, ‘fly,’ in the 
Hiraṇyakeśi Gṛhya Sūtra,
	5 and perhaps also in another passage 
of the Atharvaveda,
	6 where, however, both Whitney
	7 and 
Shaṅkar Paṇḍit read Vyadvara. 1) ii. 31, 4. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 74. 3) This would mean ‘diverging from 
the road,’ ‘devious.’ 4) The Padapāṭha analyzes the word 
as vi-adhvara. 5) ii. 16, 3. 6) vi. 50, 3. 7) Op. cit., 318, Cf. 135.

व्यल्कशा
 is the name of a plant in the Rigveda.

व्यश्व
व्य्-अश्व
 is the name of a Ṛṣi, a protégé of the Aśvins,
	1 
mentioned in several hymns of the eighth Maṇḍala,
	2 which 
may have been the composition of a descendant of his, Viśva- 
manas. In two other passages
	3 he is referred to only as a Ṛṣi 
of the past, and Oldenberg
	4 points out that none of his own 
work appears in the Saṃhitā. The Rigveda also mentions
	5 
the Vyaśvas, with whom Ludwig
	6 is inclined to connect Vaśa 
Aśvya. An Āṅgirasa Vyaśva occurs as a seer of Sāmans or 
Chants in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

 is the name of a mythical teacher in the first two 
Vaṃśas (lists of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 1) iv. 5, 22; iv. 5, 28 Mādhyaṃdina.

व्याख्यान
व्या-ख्यान
 in one passage of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 
clearly denotes a ‘narrative’ merely — viz., that of the dispute 
of Kadrū and Suparṇī. In other passages
	2 the word means 
simply ‘commentary.’ In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	3 used 
in the plural, it signifies a species of writing, apparently ‘com
mentaries,’ though its exact relation to Anuvyākhyāna must 
remain obscure. Sieg
	4 thinks that the Vyākhyānas were forms 
of narrative like Anvākhyāna and Anuvyākhyāna. 1) iii. 6, 2, 7. 2) vi. 1, 27. 33; vii. 2, 4, 28. 3) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Mādhyaṃdina =

व्याघ्र
व्याघ्र,
 ‘tiger,’ is never found in the Rigveda, but 
frequently occurs in the Atharvaveda,
	1 as well as the lion 
This fact is legitimately regarded as an indication that the 
Atharvaveda belongs to a period when the Vedic Indian had 
approached and entered the territory of Bengal. Later,
	2 also, 
mention of the tiger is quite common. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	3 
preserves a reference to the danger of waking a sleeping tiger. 
The destructive character of the animal is often alluded to,
	4 
the man-eater (puruṣād)
	5 being also mentioned. Like the lion, 
the tiger passes as a symbol of strength.
	6 This idea is illus
trated by the fact that the king at the Rājasūya (‘royal 
consecration’) steps
	7 on a tiger's skin to win himself the 
strength of the animal. Cf. also Śārdūla, Petva. 1) iv. 3, 1; 36, 6; vi. 38, 1; 103, 3;

व्याघ्रपद्य
व्याघ्र-पद्य
 is a false reading in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad (v. 16, 1) for Vaiyāghrapadya.

व्याधि
व्याधि,
 ‘disease,’ occurs several times in Vedic literature.
	1 
The specific diseases are dealt with under the separate names, 
but the Vedic texts also mention innumerable bodily defects. 
The list of victims
	2 at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) 
includes a ‘dwarf’ (vāmana, kubja), a ‘bald’ person (khalati),
	3 a 
‘blind’ man (andha),
	4 a ‘deaf’ man (badhira),
	5 a ‘dumb’ man 
(mūka),
	6 a ‘fat’ man (pīvan), a ‘leper’ (sidhmala, kilāsa),
	7 a 
‘yellow-eyed’ man (hary-akṣa), a ‘tawny-eyed’ man (piṅg- 
ākṣa), a ‘cripple’ (pīṭha-sarpin), a ‘lame’ man (srāma), a 
‘sleepless’ man (jāgaraṇa), a ‘sleepy’ man (svapana), one
	8 ‘too 
tall’ (ati-dīrgha), one ‘too short’ (ati-hrasva), one ‘too stout’ 
(ati-sthāla or aty-aṃsala), one ‘too thin’ (ati-kṛśa), one ‘too 
white’ (ati-śukla), one ‘too dark’ (ati-kṛṣṇa), one ‘too bald’ 
(ati-kulva), and one ‘too hairy’ (ati-lomaśa). 
In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	9 the man with bad nails and the 
man with brown teeth are mentioned along with sinners like 
the Didhiṣūpati. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	10 mentions a 
‘white-spotted (śukla), bald-headed man, with projecting teeth 
(viklidha) and reddish-brown eyes.’ Interesting is Zimmer's
	11 
suggestion that kirmira found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	12 
means ‘spotty’ as an intermixture of races, but it is only a 
conjecture, apparently based on a supposed connexion of the 
word with kṛ, ‘mix.’ In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	13 and the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	14 various epithets are applied to women, 
some of which seem to denote disease, and in the Atharvaveda
	15 
the feminine adjectives, ‘antelope-footed’ (ṛśya-padī) and ‘bull
toothed’ (vṛṣa-datī), probably refer to bodily defects. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 10, 3;

teeth (ati-dantura) or too small teeth 
(ati-kiriṭa). and who stares excessively 
(ati-memiṣa), Cf. Weber, Indische Streifen,

so to be understood. Cf. Weber, Indische

paryāriṇī are read. 15) i. 18, 4. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 
1, 314, understands the hymn as refer
ring to the domestic cat, but this lacks 
plausibility. The sense of the other 
epithets there occurring is quite ob
scure.

व्यान
व्य्-आन
 is the name of one of the vital airs. See Prāṇa.

व्याम
व्याम
 in the Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 denotes the 
‘span’ of the outstretched arms as a measure of length. It 
may be estimated at six feet or equivalent to a fathom.

i. 2, 5, 14; vii. 1, 1, 37, where the 
scholiast equates it to 4 Aratnis or 
cubits (while the scholiast on Āśvalā
yana Gṛhya Sūtra, ix. 1, 9, regards it 
as equal to 5 Aratnis). According to 
the Śulva Sūtra of Baudhāyana, the 
Aratni equals 24 aṅgula (= (3/4) inch). See 
Fleet, Journal of the Royal Asiatie 
Society, 1912, 231, 233, 234. 3) See Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 41, 309, n. 5.

व्यासपाराशर्य
व्यास पाराशर्य
 (‘descendant of Parāśara’) is the name of 
a mythical sage who in the Vedic period is found only as a pupil 
of Viṣvaksena in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the 
Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa and in the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	1 1) i. 9, 2. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 156; 4, 377; Indian Literature, 184, 
n. 199.

व्र
व्र,
 according to Roth,
	1 means ‘troop’ in the Rigveda
	2 and 
the Atharvaveda.
	3 Zimmer
	4 sees in the word (in the feminine 
form of vrā) a designation in one passage of the village host 
which formed part of the Viś, and was composed of relations 
(su-bandhu). On the other hand, Pischel
	5 thinks that in all the 
passages Vrā means ‘female,’ used either of animals
	6 or of 
women who go to the feast (Samana),
	7 or courtezans (viśyā, ‘of 
the people’),
	8 or, metaphorically,
	9 the hymns compared with 
courtezans; these senses are perhaps adequate. 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf. 
Bechtel, Nachrichten der königlichen Gesell- 
schaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 
1894, 393. 2) i. 124, 8; 126, 5; iv. 1, 16; viii. 2, 6; 
x. 123, 2. He omits i. 121, 2, where 
Bölitlingk, Dictionary, s.v., treats the 
word as a feminine (vrā). 3) ii. 1, 1, a confused passage, on 
which see Whitney, Translation of the

व्रज
व्रज
 denotes in the first instance, in the Rigveda,
	1 the place 
to which the cattle resort (from vraj, ‘go’), the ‘feeding ground’ 
to which the milk-giving animals go out
	2 in the morning from 
the village (Grāma), while the others stay in it all day and 
night.
	3 Secondarily it denotes the ‘herd’
	4 itself. This is 
Geldner's view,
	5 which seems clearly better than that of Roth
	6 
who regards Vraja as primarily the ‘enclosure’ (from vṛj), and 
only thence the ‘herd’; for the Vraja does not normally mean 
an ‘enclosure’ at all: the Vedic cattle were not stall-fed as a 
general rule. In some passages, however, ‘pen,’
	7 in others 
‘stall,’
	8 is certainly meant. The word is often used in the 
myth of the robbing of the kine.
	9 It occasionally denotes a 
‘cistern.’
	10 1) Rv. ii. 38, 8; x. 26, 3, and perhaps 
97, 10; 101, 8. Cf. Medhātithi on 
Manu, iv. 45, and Mahābhārata, i. 41, 
15, where go-vraja is equal to gavāṃ 
pracārāḥ, ‘the pastures of the kine,’ in 
i. 40, 17. 2) Rv. ii. 38, 8. 3) Cf. Sāyaṇa on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 18, 14. 4) Rv. v. 35, 4; vii. 27, 1; 32, 10;

cf. Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v. 7) Av. iii. 11, 5; iv. 38, 7; Śāṅkhāyana 
Āraṇyaka, ii. 16. Metaohorically, in 
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 4, 22, 
Mādhyaṃdina, it is a pen with a bolt 
(sārgala) and with a palisade (sa-pari- 
śraya). The sense of ‘pen’ is also 
possible in Rv. x. 97, 10; 101, 8, and 
is not radically opposed to it, for Vraja 
denotes the place where the cattle are 
fed, and can therefore be applied to 
the stall where they are during the 
night. Cf. Goṣṭha. 8) Rv. x. 4, 2, where the ‘warm 
Vraja’ to which the cows resort is 
alluded to, and iv. 51, 2, where the 
Dawns open wide the doors of the 
Vraja of darkness; Taittirīya. Brāh
maṇa, iii. 8, 12, 2, where the Vraja is 
said to be made of Aśvattha wood. 
The sense of ‘stall’ is probable in 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 25. 9) See Geldner, op. cit., 2, 283 et 
seq. 10) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, x. 4 = Tait

व्रत
व्रत
 (‘vow’) in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas
	2 
has the peculiar sense of the ‘milk’ used by one who is living 
on that beverage alone as a vow or penance. 1) Av. vi. 133, 2; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
vi. 2, 5, 3. 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iv. 11.

maṇa, iii. 2, 2, 14; xiv. 3, 1, 34. 
etc.

व्रतति
व्रतति
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘creeping 
plant.’ 1) viii. 40, 6; Nirukta, i. 14; vi. 28. 2) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 1, 3, etc.

व्राजपति
व्राज-पति
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where it 
is said that comrades attend Indra, as the Kulapas the Vrāja
pati, when he goes about. Zimmer
	2 thinks that this refers to 
the heads of families being subordinate in war to the village 
headman (Grāmaṇī), but Whitney
	3 seems to be right in seeing 
merely the chieftain surrounded by the leading men, the family 
heads, not necessarily merely a village headman. Vrāja alone 
occurs in one passage of the Atharvaveda,
	4 adverbially in the 
sense of ‘in troops.’ 1) x. 179, 2 = Av. vii. 72, 2. 2) Altindisches Leben, 171. 3) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 436. 4) i. 16, 1. Cf. Whitney, op. cit., 17.

व्राजबाहु
व्राज-बाहु
 is used in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (ii. 9) of the 
‘encompassing arms’ of death, Vrāja here apparently meaning 
a ‘pen,’ like Vraja. Cf. Viṣṭhā-vrājin.

व्रात
व्रात
 is found in several passages of the Rigveda
	1 and 
later
	2 in the sense of ‘troop.’ In one passage of the Rigveda
	3 
the troops of the Maruts are referred to by three different 
terms — śardha, vrāta, and gaṇa. From this fact Zimmer
	4 has 
deduced that a Vedic host fought according to clan (Viś), 
village (Grāma), and family, but this conclusion is hardly 
warranted, there being nothing to show that there is any 
intention to present a distinct series of divisions. It is not 
probable that the word ever has the technical sense of ‘guild,’ as 
Roth
	5 thinks. Cf. Vrātapati. 1) i. 163, 8; iii. 26, 2; v. 53, 11; 
ix. 14, 2 (perhaps an allusion to the 
five tribes); x. 34, 8. 12 (of dice). In 
x. 57, 5, the host of the living (jīva 
vrāta) is referred to. 2) Av. ii. 9, 2 (‘host of the living’);

Brāhmaṇa, vi. 9. 24; xvii. 1, 5. 12, etc. 3) v. 53, 11. Cf. iii. 26, 2, where 
śardha is not mentioned. 4) Altindisches Leben, 162. 5) In the St. Petersburg Dictionary,

व्रातपती
व्रात-पती,
 ‘lord of troops,’ is an epithet included in the 
names of Rudra in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās,
	1 along with the 
epithet Gaṇa-pati, ‘lord of groups.’ The exact sense is quite 
uncertain, but the term may allude to the chief of a band of 
robbers, as Zimmer
	2 thinks. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 4, 1;

व्रात्य
व्रात्य
 is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,
	1 where, however, no 
further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information 
is furnished by the Atharvaveda,
	2 the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	3 
and the Sūtras.
	4 which describe at length a certain rite intended 
for the use of Vrātyas. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’ — viz., the 
hīna, who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have 
become outcasts for some sin (nindita); those who become out
casts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and 
those old men who, being impotent (śama-nīcameḍhra), have 
gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no 
means of the same importance as the first. The motive of 
the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām 
krishṇa Bhāgavat,
	5 they were men who had enfeebled their 
constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of 
the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But 
this is not stated in the text. 
It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were 
those referred to as hīna, and that the other classes were only 
subsidiary. According to Rājārām,
	6 there were two categories 
of the first class: (a) The depressed (hīna), who were non
Āryan; and (b) degraded Āryans (gara-gir). This, however, is 
a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have 
been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is 
not probable, for it is expressly said
	7 that, though unconse
crated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were 
thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the state
ment that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to 
utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of 
speech (cf. Vāc). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’) 
and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical 
Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya. 
Other particulars accord with the view that they were 
Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they 
are said
	8 not to practise agriculture or commerce (an 
allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of 
Brahmacarya — i.e., the principle regulating the Brahminic 
order of life. They were also allowed to become members 
of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual 
prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case 
of non-Āryans. 
Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas. 
Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they 
beat those unworthy of correction.
	9 Their leder (Gṛhapati) or 
householder wore a turban (Uṣṇīṣa), carried a whip (Pratoda), 
a kind of bow (Jyāhroḍa), was clothed in a black (kṛṣṇaśa) 
garment and two skins (Ajina), black and white (kṛṣṇa-valakṣa), 
and owned a rough wagon (Vipatha) covered with planks 
(phalakāstīrṇa). The others,
	10 subordinate to the leader, had 
garments with fringes of red (valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi), two 
fringes on each, skins folded double (dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni), and 
sandals (Upānah). The leader wore also an ornament (Niṣka) 
of silver, which Rājārām
	11 converts into a silver coinage. The 
Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over 
their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the 
Sūtras (e.g., that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black 
hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa. 
The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with 
certainty, but their nomad life
	12 suggests the western tribes 
beyond the Sarasvatī. But they may equally well have been in 
the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the 
Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's 
outfit an inhabitant of Magadha. The Atharvaveda
	13 does not 
help, for it treats the Vrātya in so mystical a way that he is 
represented as being in all the quarters. Indeed, Roth
	14 
believed that it was here not a case of the Vrātya of the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa at all, but of a glorification of the Vrātya as 
the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant 
(Parivrājaka). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence 
of the words uṣṇīsa, vipatha, and pratoaa shows. It is probable 
that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the 
Vrātya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted 
Vrātya as a type of the perfect Brahmicārin, and, in so far, of 
the divinity.

व्रीहि
व्रीहि,
 ‘rice,’ is never mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 but is 
frequently alluded to in the Atharvaveda
	2 and later.
	3 Rice 
seems to be indigenous in the south-east of India:
	4 this fact 
accounts well for the absence of any mention of it in the 
Rigveda. Black and white rice is contrasted in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā,
	5 where also
	6 the distinctions of dark, swift-growing 
(āśu), and large rice (mahā-vrīhi) are found. Probably the 
swift-growing variety is that later known as ṣaṣṭika, ‘ripening 
in sixty days.’ Vrīhi and Yava, ‘barley,’ are normally con
joined in the texts.^7 Cf. Plāśuka. 1) To take dhānya bīja in Rv. v. 53, 13, 
as ‘rice seeds’ is unnecessary and very 
improbable, nor is there better reason 
to see in dhānya rasa in Av. ii. 26, 5. a 
‘rice drink.’ 2) vi. 140, 2; viii. 7, 20; ix. 6, 14,

शकधूम
शक-धूम
 is found in one hymn of the Atharvaveda,
	1 
where it is celebrated as the king of the asterisms. The word 
seems to mean the ‘smoke of (burning) cow-dung,’ or else the 
‘smoke (rising) from (fresh) cow-dung’: it may well be, as 
Weber
	2 thinks, that this was deemed to be significant of the 
weather. Bloomfield,
	3 however, considers that the word is to 
be rendered as ‘weather prophet,’ that is, one who foretells the 
weather by means of the smoke of a fire. Whitney
	4 objects to 
this view with reason. It is not at all improbable that, as 
Roth
	5 believed, an asterism of some sort is meant, probably 
the ‘milky way.’ 1) vi. 128, 1, 3. 4, and in the Nakṣatra

शकं-भर,
 ‘bearer of dung,’ is found in one passage of

	3 see in it a tribal name, Bloomfield
	4 the personification of 
excessive evacuation (diarrhœa), while Whitney

शकुनि
शकुनि,
 ‘bird,’ is used practically like Śakuna, but with a 
much clearer reference to divination. It was smaller than the 
Śyena or Suparṇa,
	1 gave signs,
	2 and foretold ill-luck.
	3 When 
it is mentioned
	4 in the list of sacrificial victims at the Aśva
medha (‘horse sacrifice’), a special species must be meant: 
later the falcon is so called, but the ‘raven’ may be intended; 
the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā thinks that it is 
the ‘crow.’ It is mentioned several times elsewhere.

शक्ति
1. Śakti is said in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 to have been 
the son of Vasiṣṭha, and to have been cast into the fire by the 
Viśvāmitras. According to Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,
	2 who appears to 
follow the Śāṭyāyanaka,
	3 the story of Śakti is as follows: 
Viśvāmitra, being defeated in a contest by Śakti, had recourse 
to Jamadagni, who taught him the Sasarparī; later he 
revenged himself on Śakti by having him burnt in the forest. 
The Bṛhaddevatā
	4 relates the first part of the tale only. 
Geldner
	5 sees in the Rigveda
	6 a description of the death 
struggle of Śakti, but this interpretation is more than doubtful.

शक्वरी,
 fem. plur., denotes the Śakvarī verses, known also

certain later.

शतद्युम्न
शत-द्युम्न
 (‘possessing a hundred glories’) is the name 
of a man who, along with Yajñeṣu, was made prosperous by 
the priest Mātsya through his knowledge of the exact moment 
for sacrifice, according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (i. 5, 2, 1).

शतपति
शत-पति
 occurs in a verse of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	1 and 
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 as an epithet of Indra, who is 
described as alone the ‘lord of a hundred’ among men. To 
interpret the expression as ‘lord of a hundred gods,’ as does 
the commentary on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, is obviously 
impossible. It seems clear that there is a reference to an 
analogous human functionary — viz., the lord of a hundred 
villages, known in the later law
	3 — who was probably at once a 
judicial deputy of the sovereign and a revenue collector, an 
ancient magistrate and collector. 1) iv. 14, 12. 2) ii. 8, 4, 2. 3) See Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 74.

शत-शारद
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 denotes 
a ‘period of a hundred autumns’ or years. 1) vii. 101, 6; x. 161, 2. 2) i. 35, 1; viii. 2, 2; 5, 21.

शतानीकसात्राजित
शतानीक सात्राजित
 is mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmana
	1 
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 as a great king who defeated 
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the prince of Kāśi, and took away his sacrificial 
horse. He was clearly a Bharata. He is also alluded to in the 
Atharvaveda.

 (‘descendant of Agniveśa’) is the name of 
a generous patron in the Rigveda.

शन्तनु|शंतनु
शं-तनु
 is the hero of a tale told by Yāska,
	1 and often 
found later.
	2 He supersedes his elder brother Devāpi as king 
of the Kurus. When his improper deed brings on a prolonged 
drought in his realm, he is compelled to ask his brother to 
assume the kingship; Devāpi, however, refuses, but instead 
performs a sacrifice which produces rain. Sieg
	3 endeavours to 
trace this story in the Rigveda,
	4 but all that is there stated is 
that Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa obtained (no doubt as priest) rain for 
Śaṃtanu (no doubt a king). There is no hint of relationship 
at all. 1) Nirukta, ii. 10. 2) Bṛhaddevatā, vii. 155 et seq., with

शपथ
शपथ
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘curse,’ not an 
‘oath,’ as a judicial process. But that an oath of such a kind 
was possible as it was later,
	2 is shown by at least one passage 
of the Rigveda,
	3 where the speaker, possibly Vasiṣṭha, impre
cates death on himself if he is a wizard, and death on his foes if 
he is not. 1) x. 87, 15; Nirukta, vii. 3. 2) Av. iii. 9, 5; iv. 9, 5; 18, 7; 19, 7. 
etc. 2) Av. iii. 9, 5; iv. 9, 5; 18, 7; 19, 7.

शफ
1. Śapha, ‘hoof,’ comes to be used to denote the fraction 
‘one-eighth,’ because of the divided hoofs of the cow, just as 
Pāda, the ‘foot’ of a quadruped, also means a ‘quarter.’ This 
sense in found as early as the Rigveda,
	1 and is not rare later.

शफ
2. Śapha in the Brāhmaṇa
	1 is the name (used in the dual) of 
a wooden implement, acting like a pair of tongs, for lifting an 
iron pot from the fire. It is probably so called because it 
resembled a hoof in being divided. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, i. 22, 14; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiv. 2, 1, 16. Cf. 
Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 44,

शफक
शफक
 is the name of some plant in the Atharvaveda.
	1 It 
is also mentioned in the Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra,
	2 where it 
seems to denote an edible water plant or fruit, perhaps a water 
nut. It may be so called from its leaves being shaped like 
hoofs (Śapha). 1) iv. 34, 5. 2) ix. 14, 14.

शमी
शमी
 is the name of a tree in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 
It is described in the Atharvaveda
	3 as destructive to the hair,
	4 as 
producing intoxication, and as broad-leaved. These charac
teristics are totally wanting in the two trees, Prosopis spicigera 
or Mimosa suma, with which the Śamī is usually identified.
	5 
From the soft wood of the Śamī was formed the lower of the 
two sticks (araṇī) used for kindling the sacred fire,
	6 the upper 
one (the drill) being of Aśvattha. The fruit of the tree is 
called Śamīdhānya.

शम्बर
शम्बर
 is the name of an enemy of Indra in the Rigveda.
	1 
He is mentioned along with Śuṣṇa, Pipru, and Varcin, being 
in one passage called a Dāsa, son of Kulitara.
	2 In another 
passage
	3 he is said to have deemed himself a godling (devaka). 
His forts, ninety,
	4 ninety-nine,
	5 or a hundred
	6 in number, are 
alluded to, the word itself in the neuter plural once
	7 meaning 
the ‘forts of Śambara.’ His great foe was Divodāsa Ati- 
thigva, who won victories over him by Indra's aid.
	8 
It is impossible to say with certainty whether Śambara was 
a real person or not. Hillebrandt
	9 is strongly in favour of the 
theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divodāsa: he 
relies on the statistics
	10 of the mention of the name to show 
that, where as he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of 
the time of Divodāsa, later texts, like those of the seventh 
Maṇḍala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of 
scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from 
this theory, Śambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy 
in India, living in the mountains.

all of the mythical kind, and those in 
vii are of much the same sort. 11) Rv. i. 130, 7; iv. 30, 14; vi. 26, 5.

शम्बिन्
शम्बिन्,
 a word occurring only once, appears to mean 
‘ferryman’ in the Atharvaveda (ix. 2, 6). The literal sense 
is probably ‘pole-man’ (from śamba, a word of doubtful 
signification found in the Rigveda, x. 42, 7).

	2 In the classical literature it is a fabulous, 
eight-legged beast, dwelling in the snowy mountains, a foe of 
lions and elephants: the commentator Mahīdhara sees this 
sense, but without reason, in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The 
animal is spoken of as akin to the goat;
	3 it was probably a 
kind of deer. 1) ix. 5, 9. Cf. Śalabha. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 2, 10, 4;

शरीर
शरीर,
 ‘body,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in Vedic 
literature.
	1 The interest of the Vedic Indians seems early to 
have been attracted to the consideration of questions connected 
with the anatomy of the body. Thus a hymn of the Atharva
veda
	2 enumerates many parts of the body with some approach 
to accuracy and orderly arrangement.
	3 It mentions the heels 
(pārṣṇī), the flesh (māṃsa), the ankle-bones (gulphau), the 
fingers (aṅgulīḥ), the apertures (kha), the two metatarsi 
(uchlakau), the tarsus (pratiṣṭhā), the two knee-caps (aṣṭhī- 
vantau), the two legs (jaṅghe), the two knee-joints (jānunoḥ 
sandhī). Then comes above the two kness (jānū) the four
sided (catuṣṭaya), pliant (śithira) trunk (kabandha). The two 
hips (śroṇī) and the two thighs (ārū) are the props of the frame 
(kusindha). Next come the breast-bone (uras), the cervical 
cartilages (grīvāḥ), the two breast pieces (stanau), the two 
shoulder-blades (kaphoḍau), the neck-bones (skandhau), and the 
backbones (pṛṣṭīḥ), the collar-bones (aṃsau), the arms (bāhū), 
the seven apertures in the head (sapta khāni śīrṣaṇi), the ears 
(karṇau), the nostrils (nāsike), the eyes (cakṣaṇī), the mouth 
(mukha), the jaws (hanū), the tongue (jihvā), the brain (mas- 
tiṣka), the forehead (lalāṭa), the facial bone (kakāṭikā), the 
cranium (kapāla), and the structure of the jaws (cityā hanvoḥ). 
This system presents marked similarities with the later 
system of Caraka and Suśruta,
	4 which render certain the names 
ascribed to the several terms by Hoernle. Kaphoḍau, which is 
variously read in the manuscripts,
	5 is rendered ‘collar-bone’ by 
Whitney, but ‘elbow’ in the St. Petersburg Dictionary. 
Skandha in the plural regularly
	6 denotes ‘neck-bones,’ or, more 
precisely, ‘cervical vertebræ,’ a part denoted also by uṣṇihā in 
the plural.
	7 Pṛṣṭī
	8 denotes not ‘rib,’ which is parśu,
	9 but a 
transverse process of a vertebra, and so the vertebra itself, 
there being in the truncal portion of the spinal column seventeen 
vertebræ and thirty-four transverse processes. The vertebræ 
are also denoted by kīkasā in the plural,
	10 which sometimes
	11 is 
limited to the upper portion of the vertebral column, sometimes
	12 
to the thoracic portion of the spine. Anūka also denotes the 
vertebral column,
	13 or more specially the lumbar
	14 or thoracic
	15 
portion of the spine; it is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	15 
that there are twenty transverse processes in the lumbar spine 
(udara) and thirty-two in the thoracic, which gives twenty-six 
vertebræ, the true number (but the modern division is seven 
cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, and two false — the 
sacrum and the coccyx). The vertebral column is also denoted 
by karūkara,
	16 which, however, is usually found in the plural
	17 
denoting the transverse processes of the vertebræ, a sense 
expressed also by kuntāpa.
	18 
Grīvā, in the plural, denotes cervical vertebræ, the number 
seven being given by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	19 but usually
	20 
the word simply means windpipe, or, more accurately, the 
cartilaginous rings under the skin. Jatru, also in the plural, 
denotes the cervical cartilages,
	21 or possibly the costal carti
lages, which are certainly so called in the Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa,
	22 where their number is given as eight. 
Bhaṃsas, which occurs thrice in the Atharvaveda,
	23 seems to 
denote the pubic bone or arch rather than the ‘buttocks’ or 
‘fundament,’ as Whitney
	24 takes it. 
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	25 the number of bones in the 
the human body is given as 360. The number of the bones 
of the head and trunk are given in another passage
	26 as 
follows: The head is threefold, consisting of skin (tvac), bone 
(asthi), brain (matiṣka); the neck has 15 bones: 14 transverse 
processes (karūkara) and the strength (vīrya) — i.e., the bone of 
the centre regarded as one — as the 15th; the breast has 17: 
16 cervical cartilages (jatru), and the sternum (uras) as the 
17th; the abdominal portion of the spine has 21: 20 trans 
verse processes (kuntāpa), and the abdominal portion (udara) as 
the 21st; the two sides have 27: 26 ribs (parśu), and the two 
sides as the 27th; the thoracic portion of the spine (anūka) 
has 33: 32 transverse processes, and the thoracic portion 
as 33rd. 
There are several enumerations of the parts of the body, not 
merely of the skeleton, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	27 They 
include the hair (lomāni), skin (tvac), flesh (māṃsa), bone 
(asthi), marrow (majjan), liver (yakṛt), lungs (kloman), kidneys 
(matasne), gall (pitta), entrails (āntrāṇi), bowels (gudāḥ), spleen 
(plīhan), navel (nābhi), belly (udara), rectum (vaniṣṭhu), womb 
(yoni), penis (plāśi and śepa), face (mukha), head (śiras), 
tongue (jihvā), mouth (āsan), rump (pāyu), leech (vāla), eye 
(cakṣus), eyelashes (pakṣmāṇi), eyebrows (utāni), nose (nas), breath 
(vyāna), nose-hairs (nasyāni), ears (karṇau), brows (bhrū), body 
or trunk (ātman), waist (upastha), hair on the face (śmaśrūṇi), 
and on the head (keśāḥ). Another enumeration
	28 gives śiras, 
mukha, keśāḥ, śmaśrūṇi, prāṇa (breath), cakṣus, śrotra (ear), jihvā, 
vāc (speech), manas (mind), aṅgulīḥ, aṅgāni (limbs), bāhū, hastau 
(hands), karṇau, ātmā, uras (sternum), pṛṣṭīḥ (vertebræ), udara, 
aṃsau, grīvāḥ, śroṇī, ūrū, aratnī (elbows), jānūni, nābhi, pāyu, 
bhasat (fundament), āṇḍau (testicles), pasas (membrum virile), 
jaṅghā, pad (foot), lomāni, tvac, māṃsa, asthi, majjan. Another 
set of names
	29 includes vaniṣṭhu, purītat (pericardium), lomāni, 
tvac, lohita (blood), medas (fat), māṃsāni, snāvāni (sinews), 
asthīni, majjānaḥ, retas (semen), pāyu, kośya (flesh near the 
heart), pārśvya (intercostal flesh), etc. 
The bones of the skeleton of the horse are enumerated in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	30 
In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	31 the human body is regarded as 
made up of one hundred and one items; there are four parts, 
each of twenty-five members, with the trunk as one hundred 
and first. In the two upper parts there are five four-jointed
	32 
fingers, two kakṣasī (of uncertain meaning),
	33 the arm (dos), the 
collar-bone (akṣa), and the shoulder-blade (aṃsa-phalaka). In 
the two lower portions there are five four-jointed toes, the 
thigh, the leg, and three articulations, according to Sāyaṇa's 
commentary. 
The Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	34 enumerates three bones in the 
head,
	35 three joints (parvāṇi) in the neck,
	36 the collar-bone 
(akṣa),
	37 three joints in the fingers,
	38 and twenty-one transverse 
processes in the spine (anūka).
	39 The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	40 
enumerates four constituents in the head (prāṇa, cakṣus, śrotra, 
vāc), but there are many variations, the number going up to 
twelve on one calculation.
	41 In the Taittirīya Upaniṣad
	42 an 
enumeration is given consisting of carma (skin), māṃsa, snāvan, 
asthi, and majjan; and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	43 has lomāni, māṃsa, 
tvac, asthi, majjan, and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	44 couples majjānaḥ, 
snāvāni, and asthīni. Other terms relating to the body are 
kaṅkūṣa,
	45 perhaps a part of the ear,
	46 yoni (female organ), 
kakṣa
	47 (armpit), Danta (tooth), nakha (nail), prapada
	48 (forepart 
of the foot), halīkṣṇa
	49 (gall). 1) Rv. i. 32, 10; x. 16, 1, etc.; Av.

शर्ध्य

 in one passage of the Rigveda

	1 Śaryā,
	2 seem in the Rigveda to denote an ‘arrow.’
	3 
Perhaps, also, Śaryā

	5 (neut.) mean the ‘wicker 
work’ in the Soma sieve, but the exact sense of the passages is 
doubtful.

certain. 2) i. 148, 4; x. 178, 3. Cf. Nirukta

denoting the outer husk of the Soma 
plant. See also Geldner, Vedische Studien, 
2, 255, n. 1.

शर्यणावत्|शर्यणावन्त्
शर्यणावन्त्
 occurs in several passages of the Rigveda,
	1 in 
all of which Sāyaṇa sees a local name. According to his 
account, Śaryaṇāḥ (masc. plur.) is a district in Kurukṣetra, 
Śaryaṇāvant being a lake not far from it in the back part 
(jaghanārdhe) of Kurukṣetra. The unusual consistency of his 
statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place 
name; it is also to be noted that Kurukṣetra contained the 
lake Anyataḥplakṣā. Roth,
	2 however, thought that in two 
passages
	3 the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water) 
covered with a thicket of reeds’ (śaryaṇa), and in the others a 
Soma vessel. Zimmer
	4 inclines to this rendering. On the 
other hand, Pischel
	5 accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt
	6 also 
sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it 
among the ‘five tribes,’
	7 which is not quite inconsistent with its 
being in Kurukṣetra, for the connexion of the Pūrus with the 
later Kurus is known;
	8 or perhaps, he suggests, Śaryaṇāvant 
is an old name for the Wular sea of Kaśmīr, which was only a 
reminiscence in Vedic times. This is not probable; still less 
so is Ludwig's hypothesis
	9 that the Śaryaṇāvant is the later 
eastern Sarasvatī. Bergaigne
	10 regards the name as that of 
a celestial preparer of Soma. 1) i. 84, 14; viii. 6, 39; 7, 29; 64, 11; 
ix. 65, 22; 113, 1; x. 35, 2. See

Müller, Sacred Books of the East, 32, 
398, 399. 6) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 126, et seq. 7) This is deduced, not with any

शर्यात
शर्यात
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda
	1 as a protégé of 
the Aśvins. Of him in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa^2 and the 
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	3 is told a story how Cyavana was annoyed 
by the Śāryātas, and appeased by the gift of Sukanyā, 
Śaryāta's daughter, as a wife, and how Cyavana was then 
restored to youth by the Aśvins. He is there called Mānava 
(‘descendant of Manu’). He appears also as Śaryāta Mānava, 
a sacrificer, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.

शल
शल
 is explained by the St. Petersburg Dictionary as a 
measure of length in the Atharvaveda,
	1 Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	2 and 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.
	3 Whitney
	4 objects that the sense in all
	5 
these passages is not suited by this meaning. 1) viii. 7, 28. 2) xii. 10 (Indische Studien, 3, 464). 3) i. 5, 10, 1 (where this is the inter
pretation of the commentator). 4) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
501. 5) He does not notice the Kāṭhaka. 
Against his criticism it must be noted 
that in every one of the passages a 
numeral is compounded with Śala, as 
tri-śala, etc.

शलभ
शलभ,
 ‘locust,’ appears in the Paippalāda recension of the 
Atharvaveda
	1 for Śarabha, the reading of the received text, and 
is regarded by Whitney
	2 as making better sense. 1) ix. 5, 9. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
534. But the mention of the goat in 
the passage strongly supports Sarabha. 
See Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa i. 2, 3, 9.

passage. 1) iii. 43, 5 (Weber, Indische Studien, 9, 277). Cf. Weber, Indian Literature, 33, n. 2) Dictionary, s.v.

शाकल्य
शाकल्य,
 ‘descendant of Śakala,’ is the patronymic of 
Vidagdha in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and of Sthavira in the 
Aitareya
	2 and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas.
	3 An undefined Śākalya 
is mentioned in the same Āraṇyakas,
	4 in the Nirukta,
	5 and often 
later, as a teacher dealing with the text of the Rigveda. 
Weber
	6 is inclined to identify Vidagdha with the Śākalya who 
is known as the maker of the Pada Pāṭha of the Rigveda, but 
Oldenberg

period. Geldner

not very probable.

शाङ्खायन
 as the name of a teacher is not mentioned in 
the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, but it occurs in the Vaṃśa (list of 
teachers) at the end of the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	1 where 
Guṇākhya is given as the authority for that work. In the 
Śrauta Sūtras
	2 the name of Śāṅkhāyana never occurs, but the 
Gṛhya Sūtras
	3 seem to recognize as teacher Suyajña Śāṅkhā- 
yana. In later times
	4 the school flourished in Northern 
Gujarat. Śāṅkhāyana appears in the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya
	5 
along with Kāṇḍamāyana. 1) xv. 1. Oldenberg's suggestion 
(Sacred Books of the East, xxix. 4, 5)

शाट्यायन
शाट्यायन,
 ‘descendant of Śāṭya,’ is the patronymic of a 
teacher mentioned twice in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 and 
often in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.
	2 In a Vaṃśa 
(list of teachers) in the latter work
	3 he is called a pupil of 
Jvālāyana, while in the Vaṃśa at the end of the Sāmavidhāna 
Brāhmaṇa he appears as a pupil of Bādarāyaṇa. The Śāṭyā
yanins, his followers, are frequently mentioned in the Sūtras,
	4 
the Śāṭyāyani Brāhmaṇa
	5 and the Śāṭyāyanaka
	6 being also 
referred to in them. It has been shown by Oertel
	7 that this 
Brāhmaṇa bore a close resemblance to, and probably belonged 
to the same period as, the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa. 1) viii. 1, 4, 9; x. 4, 5, 2. 2) i. 6, 2; 30, 1; ii. 2, 8; 4, 3; 9, 10;

शाण्ड
शाण्ड,
 ‘descendant of Śaṇḍa,’ is the name of a man in the 
Rigveda
	1 who is praised for his generosity. It is not likely 
that he is identical with Purupanthā mentioned in the next 
verse. 1) vi. 63, 9. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158.

शाण्डिल
शाण्डिल,
 masc. plur., is the term applied to the ‘descendants 
of Śāṇḍilya’ in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (i. 22, 10).

शाण्डिलीपुत्र
शाण्डिली-पुत्र,
 ‘pupil of a female descendant of Śaṇḍila,’ is 
the name of a teacher, a pupil of Rāthītarīputra, in the last 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 1) vi. 4, 32 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 2 Kāṇva).

शाण्डिल्य
शाण्डिल्य,
 ‘descendant of Śaṇḍila,’ is the patronymic of 
several teachers (see Udara and Suyajña). The most important 
Śāṇḍilya is the one cited several times as an authority in the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where his Agni, or ‘sacrificial fire,’ is 
called Śāṇḍila.
	2 From this it appears clearly that he was one 
of the great teachers of the fire ritual which occupies the fifth 
and following books of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. In the 
Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the tenth book
	3 he is 
given as a pupil of Kuśri and a teacher of Vātsya; another list 
at the end of the last book in the Kāṇva recension
	4 gives him 
as a pupil of Vātsya, and the latter as a pupil of Kuśri. In the 
confused and worthless
	5 lists of teachers at the end of the 
second and fourth books of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad he is 
said to be the pupil of various persons — Kaiśorya Kāpya,
	6 
Vaiṣṭapureya,
	7 Kauśika,
	8 Gautama,
	9 Baijavāpa,
	10 and Āṇa- 
bhimlāta.
	11 No doubt different Śāṇḍilyas may be meant, but 
the lists are too confused to claim serious consideration. 1) ix. 4, 4, 17; 5, 2, 15; x. 1, 4, 10; 
4, 1, 11; 6, 3, 5; 5, 9. Cf. Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad, iii. 11, 4. 2) ix. 1, 1, 43; 3, 3, 18; 5, 1, 61, 68, etc. 3) x. 6, 5, 9. 4) vi. 5, 4. 5) Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East,

शाण्डिल्यायन
शाण्डिल्यायन,
 ‘descendant of Śāṇḍilya,’ is the patronymic 
of a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Apparently he is 
identical with Celaka, also mentioned in that text;
	2 it is thus 
reasonable to suppose that Cailaki Jīvala
	3 was his son. It is 
much more doubtful whether he was
	4 the grandfather of 
Pravāhaṇa Jaivala, who was a prince rather than a Brahmin. 1) ix. 5, 1, 64. 2) x. 4, 5, 3. The name Śāṇḍily
āyana, like that of Sāṇḍilya, is common 
in the Sūtras. See Weber, Indische 
Studien, 1, 45, et seq. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 1, 34. 4) Weber, op. cit., 1, 259.

शमूल
शमूल
 in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa

शाम्बर
शाम्बर,
 properly an adjective in the sense of ‘relating to 
Śambara,’ appears in one passage of the Rigveda (iii. 47, 4) to 
be used as a substantive denoting ‘the contest with Śambara.’

शाम्बु
शाम्बु
 occurs in the plural with the Aṅgirases in a passage 
of the Atharvaveda,
	1 no doubt as the name of a family of 
ancient teachers. There is extant in manuscript a Gṛhya Sūtra 
of the Śāmbavyas.

शारद
शारद
 See Pur.

शारि
1. Śāri occurs in the list of victims at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 It seems clear, 
since it is described as ‘of human speech’ (puruṣa-vāc), that it 
was some kind of bird, possibly the later Sārikā (‘starling’), as 
Zimmer
	2 suggests. See also Śāriśākā. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 12, 1; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xxiv. 33. 2) Altindisches Leben, 90, 91.

शारि
2. Śāri, occurring in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 is said by 
Sāyaṇa to mean ‘arrow.’ This is uncertain, but connexion 
with Śara or 1. Śāri is quite possible.
	2 1) i. 112, 16. 2) Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 103.

शारिशाका
शारिशाका
 is an utterly obscure expression found in one 
passage of the Atharvaveda.
	1 Weber
	2 thinks it means ‘dung 
(śakan) of the Śāri bird’; Grill
	3 sees in the word the śārikā, 
‘the hooded crow’; Roth
	4 suggests the emendation (śāriḥ 
(= śāliḥ) śaka iva, ‘like rice in manure’; and Bloomfield
	5 
emends śāri-śukeva, ‘like starlings and parrots.’ 1) iii. 14, 5. 2) Indische Studien, 17, 246. 3) Hundert Lieder,^2 112. 4) In Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 110. 5) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 351. But 
see Lanman's note in Whitney, loc.

शार्कराक्ष
शार्कराक्ष
 is found in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	1 as the patro
nymic of a teacher, Śāmba, perhaps by a blunder for Śār- 
karākṣya, ‘descendant of Śarkarākṣa.’ In the Kāṭhaka Saṃ
hitā
	2 a teacher, Śarkarākhya, occurs, again probably a blunder, 
in this case for Śarkarākṣa himself. The patronymic Śārkar
ākṣi is found in the Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra.
	3 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372. 2) xxii. 8. 3) xii. 10. 10.

शार्कराक्ष्य
शार्कराक्ष्य,
 ‘descendant of Śarkarākṣa,’ is the patronymic 
of Jana in the Śatapatha Brāhmana
	1 and the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad.
	2 In the plural they occur in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	3 
and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	4 It is not necessary to assume 
that the form is incorrect for Śārkarākṣa. 1) x. 6, 1, 1. 2) v. 11, 1; 15, 1. 3) ii. 1, 4. 4) Indische Studien, 4, 382.

शार्ग
शार्ग
 is the name of a bird in the list of victims at the 
Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 
Sāyana on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā calls it the ‘wild Caṭaka.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 19, 1;

शार्ङ्ग
शार्ङ्ग
 — The Anukramaṇī
	1 (Index) of the Rigveda ascribes 
a hymn of that text
	2 to the Śārṅgas, Jaritṛ, Droṇa, Sārisṛkva, 
and Stambamitra. The Mahābhārata
	3 contains a tale describing 
how the four Śārṅgas, sons of the Ṛṣi Mandapāla, were saved 
from the great fire in the Khāṇḍava forest by means of 
prayers. Sieg
	4 has attempted to use this tale for the elucida
tion of the hymn in question, but without substantial success. 
As Oldenberg
	5 says, the tale is based on the hymn rather than 
vice versa. 1) See also Sāyaṇa on Rv. x. 142;

शार्यात
शार्यात,
 perhaps ‘descendant of Śaryāta,’ is the name of a 
singer in the Rigveda.
	1 A Śāryāta appears also in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 with the patronymic Mānava as the seer of a 
Rigvedic hymn,
	3 and as having been anointed by Cyavana.
	4 
The same man is evidently meant by Śaryāta in the story of 
Cyavana in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	5 and the Jaiminīya Brāh
maṇa.
	6 In both these passages the Śāryātas are mentioned as 
his descendants, and his daughter is called Śāryātī. 1) i. 51, 12; iii. 51, 7. 2) iv. 32, 7. 3) x. 92. 4) viii. 21, 4. 5) iv. 1, 5, 1 et seq. 6) iii. 121 et seq. (Whitney, Journal of

Śilaka in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (i. 8, 1), and of Galūnasa 
Ārkṣākāyaṇa in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 38, 4).

सालि
सालि,

शिंशुमार
शिंशु-मार,
 
	1 or Śiśu-māra,
	2 is the name of an aquatic

appendage. See Lanman in Whitney,

	1 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

शिखण्ड
शिखण्ड
 denotes a ‘tuft’ or ‘lock,’ as a mode of wearing 
the hair, in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 3, 16, 2 (in 
the plural); catuḥ-śikhaṇḍa, Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 1, 27; iii. 7, 6, 4 
(corresponding to catuḥ-kaparda, Rv. 
x. 114, 3). So śikhaṇḍin means ‘wearing 
a tuft of hair,’ and is found in Av. 
iv. 37, 7; xi. 2, 12, etc.

शिखण्डिन्याज्ञसेन
शिखण्डिन् याज्ञसेन
 (‘descendant of Yajñasena’) is 
mentioned in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (vii. 4) as a priest of 
Keśin Dālbhya.

शिखर
शिखर
 as a ‘peak’ of a mountain is found in the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa (xxvi. 1), and often in the Epic.

शिखा
शिखा
 denotes in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 the ‘knot of 
hair’ worn on the top of the head. Wearing the top-knot 
unloosened was the sign of mourning in the case of women and 
men alike.

Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of 
Philology, 11, 340; Hymns of the Athar- 
vaveda, 634, on Av. ix. 9, 7.

शिग्रु
शिग्रु
 is the name of a tribe occurring in the passage of the 
Rigveda,
	1 in which they are mentioned with the Ajas and the 
Yakṣus as having been defeated by the Tṛtsus and King Sudās. 
It is impossible to say whether they were or were not under 
the leadership of Bheda, as Ludwig
	2 plausibly suggests. If 
Sigru is connected with the later śigru, ‘horse-radish’ (Moringa 
pterygosperma), which is quite probable, it is possible that the 
tribe was totemistic and non-Āryan, but this is a mere matter 
of conjecture.
	3 The Matsyas (‘Fishes’) were probably Āryan. 1) vii. 18, 19. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 173. 3) Cf. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda,

शिञ्जार
शिञ्जार
 is the name of a Ṛṣi twice mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 
along with Kaṇva, Priyamedha, Upastuta, and Atri. Geldner
	2 
takes the word either as a name of Atri or an adjective. 1) viii. 5, 25; x. 40, 7. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 3, 139. 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 179.

शितिकक्षी
शिति-कक्षी
 in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 is explained by Sāyaṇa 
as a ‘white-breasted’ (pāṇḍarodara) vulture. The word may, 
however, well be only an adjective.^2 1) v. 5, 20, 1. Cf. Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 4; Av. v. 23, 5. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 93.

शितिपृष्ठ
शिति-पृष्ठ
 (‘white-backed’) is the name of the Maitrāvaruṇa 
priest at the snake festival in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

शितिबाहुऐषकृतनैमिशि
शिति-बाहु ऐषकृत नैमिशि
 is mentioned as a sacrificer in 
the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where it is recorded that a monkey 
an off with his sacrificial cake. 1) i. 363 (Journal of the American Oriental Society, 26, 192).

शित्पुट
शित्पुट
 in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 denotes, according to the 
commentator, a kind of cat. 1) v. 5, 17, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 86.

शिपद
शिपद
 occurs only in the Rigveda
	1 in the negative form 
a-śipada, together with a-śimida. Both Śipada and Śimida are 
perhaps names of unknown diseases.
	2 1) vii. 50, 4. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 394.

शिपवित्नुक
शिपवित्नुक
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 seems to denote a species 
of worm. 1) v. 20, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 262.

शिप्रा
शिप्रा
 is a word of somewhat uncertain sense: it seems to 
mean ‘cheeks’ in several passages;
	1 in others
	2 it appears to 
designate the ‘cheek-pieces’ of a helmet, or of the ‘bit’
	3 of a 
horse. In ayaḥ-śipra, used of the Aśvins,
	4 and the other com
pounds, hiraṇya-śipra,
	5 hari-śipra,
	6 and hiri-śipra,
	7 the word 
probably has the extended sense of ‘helmet,’ described as ‘of 
iron,’ ‘of gold,’ or ‘yellow,’ Similarly śiprin
	8 would mean 
‘wearing a helmet.’ 1) Rv. iii. 32, 1; v. 36, 2; viii. 76, 10; 
x. 96, 9; 105, 5, all according to Roth, 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Geldner. 
Rigveda, Glossar, 179, who treats the 
word as a neuter (śipra), takes it in 
i. 101, 10, as ‘lip’ (cf. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 249, n.), and sees in 
iii. 32, 1; viii. 76, 10; x. 96, 9, the 
sense of ‘moustache.’ Yāska, Nirukta, 
vi. 17, gives the alternative senses of 
‘jaw’ and ‘nose.’ 2) Rv. v. 54, 11; viii. 7, 25. Geldner, 
loc. cit., here accepts śiprā as ‘helmet.’ 3) Rv. i. 101, 10; Zimmer, loc. cit. 4) Rv. iv. 37, 4. 5) Rv. ii. 34, 3. 6) Rv. x. 96, 4. 7) Rv. ii. 2, 3; vi. 25, 9. 8) Rv. i. 29, 2; 81, 4; vi, 44, 14, 
etc.

East, 32, 301; Geldner, Vedische Studien, 
2, 39, n. 2.

शिफा
शिफा
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where Sāyaṇa 
explains the word as the name of a river, quite a possible 
interpretation. 1) i. 104, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 18; Perry, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 11, 201.

शिबि
शिबि,
 son of Uśīnara, is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra
	1 as a protégé of Indra, who sacrificed for him on the 
Varṣiṣṭhīya plain, and saved him from fear of foreign invasion. 1) xxi. 18. Cf. Caland, Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana, 28.

शिमिद
शिमिद,
 occurring in the Rigveda
	1 in the compound a-śinida, 
perhaps denotes a disease. The feminine form, Śimidā, is 
found as the name of a demoness in the Atharvaveda
	2 and the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	3 Cf. Śipada. 1) vii. 50, 4. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 394. 2) iv. 25, 4. 3) vii. 4, 1, 27.

शिम्बल
शिम्बल
 in the Rigveda
	1 denotes, according to Sāyaṇa, the 
flower of the Śālmali (= Śalmali), ‘silk-cotton tree.’ 1) iii. 53, 22. Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 179; Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 
1, 254.

शिम्यु
शिम्यु
 occurs in the Rigveda
	1 as the name of one of the 
peoples or kings who were defeated by Sudās in the Dāśarājña 
(‘battle of the ten kings’). Since in another passage
	2 the 
Śimyus are coupled with the Dasyus, Zimmer
	3 plausibly 
concludes that they were non-Āryans. 1) vii. 18, 5. 2) i. 100, 18, where Roth, St. Peters
burg Dictionary, s.v., thinks that the 
word simply means ‘enemy.’ 3) Altindisches Leben, 118, 119. 
Cf. Hopkins, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 15, 261.

शिरिम्बिठ
शिरिम्बिठ
 occurs in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where the 
name of a man may possibly be meant, the Anukramaṇī 
(Index) ascribing the hymn in which the word occurs to his 
authorship. Yāska,
	2 however, renders the term by ‘cloud.’ 1) x. 155, 1. 2) Nirukta, vi. 30. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 167.

शिलकशालावत्य
शिलक शालावत्य
 (‘descendant of Śalāvant’) is the name of 
a teacher, a contemporary of Calkitāyana Dālbhya and Pra- 
vāhaṇa Jaivala, in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (i. 8, 1).

शिल्प
1. Śilpa means ‘art,’ of which three kinds — nṛtya, ‘dance’; 
gīta, ‘song’; and vādita, ‘instrumental music,’ are enumerated 
in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (xxix. 5).

शिल्पकश्यप
2. Śilpa Kaśyapa is named in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) 
in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad
	1 as a teacher, a pupil of 
Kaśyapa Naidhruvi. 1) vi. 4, 33 (Mādhyaṃdina = vi. 5, 3 Kāṇva).

शिव
शिव
 as the name of a people occurs once in the Rigveda,
	1 
where they share with the Alinas, Pakthas, Bhalānases, and 
Viṣāṇins the honour of being defeated by Sudās, not of being, 
as Roth
	2 thought, his allies. There can hardly be any doubt 
of their identity with the 
	3 or 
	4 of the Greeks, who 
dwelt between the Indus and the Akesines (Asiknī) in Alexander's 
time. The village of Śiva-pura, mentioned by the scholiast on 
Pāṇini
	5 as situated in the northern country, may also preserve 
the name. Cf. Śibi. 1) vii. 18, 7. 2) Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des 
Veda, 95 et seq.; once accepted by 
Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 126. 3) Arrian, Indica, v. 12. 4) Diodorus, xvii. 96. 5) iv. 2, 109. Connected with Śiva

शिशुआङ्गिरस
शिशु आङ्गिरस
 (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of the 
seer of a Sāman or Chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) xiii. 3, 24. Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2, 160.

शिशुक
शिशुक
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 seems to be an adjective meaning 
‘young,’ but according to Bloomfield
	2 it has the sense of ‘foal.’ 
The commentator, Sāyaṇa, reads Śuśuka, which he explains as 
a ‘wild animal so called.’ Cf. Āśuṃga. 1) vi. 14, 3. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 291. 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 464.

शिशुमार
1. Śiśumāra. See Śiṃśumāra.

शिशुमार
2. Śiśumāra is a term applied to Śarkara in the Pañcaviṃśa 
Brāhmaṇa (xiv. 5, 15), where he is called a Śiśumārarṣi, 
explained by the commentator to mean a Ṛṣi in the form of a 
Siśumāra.

सिश्नदेव
सिश्न-देव,
 occurring twice in the Rigveda
	1 in the plural, 
means ‘those who have the phallus for a deity.’ The term 
most probably refers to the phallus worship of the aborigines. 1) vii. 21, 5; x. 99, 3. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 118; Hopkins, 
Religions of India, 150; von Schroeder,

शीपाल
शीपाल
 is the name of a water plant (Blyxa Octandra) men
tioned in the Rigveda.
	1 Its later name is Śaivala. 1) x. 68, 5. Cf. the derivative adjec
tive śīpalya, ‘overgrown with Śīpāla 
plants,’ Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iii. 1. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 71.

शीपाला
शीपाला
 is found once in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it may mean 
either a ‘pool abounding in Śīpāla plants’ or the proper name 
of a river or lake. 1) vi. 12, 3. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 71; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 289, 290; Bloomfield, 
Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 462.

शीपुद्रु
शीपुद्रु
 is merely an incorrect reading in the text of the 
Atharvaveda
	1 for Cīpudru. 1) vi. 127, 1. See Whitney, Translation of the Atharvaveda, 376.

शीर्षक्ति
शीर्षक्ति
 is a common word for ‘headache’ in the Atharva
veda.
	1 1) i. 12, 3; ix. 8, 1; xii. 2, 19; 5, 23. 
Cf. Bloomfield, Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 16, xxxv; Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 252; American Journal of 
Philology, 17, 416, who sees in it śīrṣa- 
sakti (cf. Macdonell, Vedic Grammar, 
64, 2). Böhtlingk, Proceedings of the 
Saxon Academy, 1897, 50, thinks the 
word means ‘a stiff neck, with head 
awry.’ See Lanman in Whitney, Trans
lation of the Atharvaveda, 14. In Av. 
xix. 39, 10, śīrṣa-śoka is used for ‘head
ache.’

शीर्षण्य
शीर्षण्य
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 denotes the ‘head’ of a couch 
(Asandī). 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, viii. 5, 3; 12, 3; 17, 2; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, i. 5 
Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra. xvii. 2, 8.

शीर्षामय
शीर्षामय,
 ‘disease of the head,’ is mentioned in the Athar
vaveda (v. 4, 10; ix. 8, 1).

शीष्ट
शीष्ट
 occurs only in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda,
	1 
where the word seems to be the name of an unimportant clan. 1) viii. 53, 4. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 163.

शुक
शुक,
 ‘parrot,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 where a desire 
is expressed to transfer to the Śuka and the Ropaṇākā the 
yellowness of jaundice. The bird is included in the list of 
sacrificial victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	2 It is described as yellow and as ‘of 
human speech’ (puruṣa-vāc).
	3 According to Bloomfield,
	4 this 
word is the correct reading for the second half of the obscure 
Śāriśākā of the Atharvaveda.

शुक्ति आङ्गिरस
 (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of 
the seer of a Sāman or Chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 
(xii. 5, 16).

शुक्र
1. Śukra, according to Tilak,
	1 has in two passages of the 
Rigveda
	2 the sense of a planet. This is most improbable. Cf. 
Manthin. 1) Orion, 162. 2) iii. 32, 2; ix. 46, 4.

शुक्रजाबाल
2. Śukra Jābāla (‘descendant of Jabālā’) is the name of 
a teacher in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 7).

शुक्ल
शुक्ल
 See Yajus.

शुक्लदत्|शुक्लदन्त्
शुक्ल-दन्त्,
 ‘white-tusked,’ is applied as an epithet to Mṛga, 
‘wild beast,’ in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 23, 3). ‘Elephants’ 
must be meant.

शुच
शुच
 and Śucā occur in an obscure verse of the Rigveda 
(x. 26, 6), where a man and a woman may be meant.

 (‘descendant of Gopāla’) is the 
name of the priest of Vṛddhadyumna Abhipratāriṇa in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 He is also mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā.
	2 1) iii. 48, 9 (Ganpalāyana in Aufrecht's edition). 2) iii. 10, 4.

शुतुद्री
शुतुद्री,
 twice mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 is the name of 
the most easterly river of the Panjab, the modern Sutlej, the 
Zaradros of Ptolemy and Arrian.
	2 In the post-Vedic period 
the name of this river appears transformed to Śatadru (‘flowing 
in a hundred channels’). The Sutlej has changed its course 
very considerably within historical times.

शुनःपुच्छ
शुनः-पुच्छ,
 ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a brother of 
Śunaḥśepa
	1 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 15, 7; Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, v. 20, 1.

शुनःशेप
शुनः-शेप,
 ‘Dog’s tail,’ is the name of a man with the 
patronymic Ājīgarti. According to a tale told in the Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	1 and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	2 he was 
purchased as a victim by Rohita, King Hariścandra's son, 
who had been promised by his father to Varuṇa as a sacrifice. 
He was actually bound to the stake, but was released in time 
through his supplications, supposed to be preserved in certain 
hymns of the Rigveda.
	3 He was adopted by Viśvāmitra, to 
whose advice he owed the inspiration to ask the gods to release 
him, and became his son as Devarāta, much to the annoyance 
of some of Viśvāmitra's sons, who in consequence were cursed 
by their father. The Rigveda, however, contains merely the 
statement of Śunaḥśepa's deliverance from peril of death by 
the divine help, and the Yajurvedas
	4 simply say that he was 
seized by Varuṇa (perhaps with dropsy),
	5 but saved himself from 
Varuṇa's bonds. 1) vii. 13-18. 2) xv. 20, 1 et seq. Cf. xvi. 11, 2. 3) i. 24 et seq. Cf. v. 2, 7. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 1, 3;

सुम्बल
सुम्बल
 is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 The 
meaning of the word is uncertain: Harisvāmi in his commen
tary takes it to be ‘straw’; Eggeling
	2 suggests that dried 
cotton fibre or pods may be meant. In any case, some sub
stance that easily catches fire is intended.

edition with great detriment to the sense. This correction is

 is a name of Amitratapana, a king of the Śibis, in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (viii. 23, 10).

शूद्र
शूद्र
 is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic 
state (see Varṇa). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except 
in the Puruṣasūkta
	1 (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla, 
where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the 
Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other 
hand, knows Dasyu and Dāsa, both as aborigines independent 
of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to 
reckon the Śūdra of the later texts as belonging to the 
aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans. 
Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been 
regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions 
when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred 
quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be 
used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the 
aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan 
lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in 
Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early 
cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other 
hand, the term Śūdra would also cover the wild hill tribes 
which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would 
acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it 
could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan 
state. 
This view of the Śūdra suits adequately the Vedic references 
to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic 
slaves only. The Śūdra is continually opposed to the Āryan,
	2 
and the colour of the Śūdra is compared with that of the 
Āryan,
	3 just as his ways are so contrasted.
	4 The Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa,
	5 in its account of the castes, declares that the 
Śūdra is anyasya preṣya, ‘the servant of another’; kāmotthāpya, 
‘to be expelled at will’; and yathākāmavadhya, ‘to be slain at 
will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the 
serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been 
applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with 
but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a 
grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa
	6 explains that even if prosperous (bahu-paśu, ‘having 
many cows’) a Śūdra could not be other than a servant: his 
business was pādāvanejya, ‘the washing of the feet’ of his 
superiors. The Mahābhārata
	7 says out and out that a Śūdra 
has no property (na hi svam asti śūdrasya, ‘the Śūdra has 
nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in 
England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and 
limb,
	8 so it appears that the slaying of a Śūdra involved a 
wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudhāyana
	9 and 
Āpastamba.
	10 It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was 
only due in case of murder by another than the master, but 
such limitation is nowhere stated. 
In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and Śūdra 
was, of course, specially marked. The texts
	11 do not hesitate 
to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras; 
the Śūdra is prohibited
	12 from milking the cow for the milk 
required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	13 forbids a man who has been consecrated 
(dīkṣita) for a sacrifice to speak to a Śūdra at all for the time, 
though the Śāṭyāyanaka
	14 seems to have relaxed this rule by 
confining it to cases in which the Śūdra was guilty of some sin. 
At the sacrifice itself the Śūdra could not be present in the 
śālā, ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāh
máṇa
	15 and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	16 as unfit for ‘sacrifice’ 
(ayajñiya); and declared in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	17 not to be 
admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory 
Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact 
with a Śūdra,
	18 who here, as in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,
	17 is 
reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On 
the other hand, the Śūdra is one of the victims at the Puruṣa
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,
	19 and a fight 
between an Āryan and a Śūdra, in which, of course, the former 
wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a pre
cursor of the Indian drama.
	20 
Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be 
undesirable to ignore the real importance of the Śūdra, which 
again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though 
legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a 
free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts,
	21 just 
as Śūdra gahapatis, ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts, 
and Śūdra kings in the legal literature.
	22 Sin against Śūdra and 
Āryan is mentioned;
	23 prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras, 
as well as of the other castes
	24 occur; and the desire to be dear 
to Śūdra as well as to Āryan is expressed.
	25 
The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules 
points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in 
sitting, etc.,
	26 their exclusion from the study of the Vedas,
	27 
the danger of contact with them
	28 or their food,
	29 still recog
nize that Śūdras can be merchants,
	30 or even exercise any 
trade.
	31 
Moreover, the Sūtras
	32 permit the marriage of a Śūdrā 
woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach 
to Vatsa
	33 and to Kavaṣa
	34 that they were the sons of a Śūdrā 
and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach 
shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover, 
illicit unions of Ārya and Śūdrā, or Śūdra and Āryā, are 
referred to in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda.
	35 
The origin of the term Śūdra is quite obscure, but Zimmer
	36 
points out that Ptolemy
	37 mentions  as a people, and he 
thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any 
stress on this identification,
	38 it is reasonable to accept the 
view
	39 that the term was originally the name of a large tribe 
opposed to the Āryan invasion. See also Niṣāda. 1) x. 90, 12. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts,

Dravidian ethnologically, but Turco
Iranian (Indian Empire, 1, 292, 310). 
It is suggested (ibid., 1, 382) that they 
represent the original Dravidian type, 
which in India has been merged in the 
Muṇḍā type; but this suggestion is 
invalidated by the fact that the Rigveda 
speaks of the Dasyus as anās, ‘nose
less’ (cf. Dasyu, 1, 347, n. 7). a term 
admirably applicable to Dravidians, 
but ludicrous as applied to the Turco
Iranian type. It is much more plausible 
to assume that the Brāhuis are a mixed 
race, which in course of time has lost 
most of its Dravidian features. On 
the relation of Dravidians and speakers 
of Muṇḍā tongues, the Vedic texts 
throw no light. 39) See Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 85,

	5 Atidhanvan 
Śaunaka appears as a teacher. That Upaniṣad
	6 and the 
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa
	7 mention a Śaunaka Kāpeya 
who was a contemporary of Abhipratārin Kākṣaseni, whose 
Purohita Śaunaka was according to another passage
	8 of the 
latter Upaniṣad. In the Sūtras, the Bṛhaddevatā, etc., a 
Śaunaka appears as a great authority on grammatical, ritual, 
and other matters.

शौनकीपुत्र
शौनकी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of a female descendant of Śunaka,’ is 
the name of a teacher, a pupil of Kāśyapībālākyāmāṭharī- 
putra in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina 
recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30. 31).

शौर्पणाय्य
शौर्प-णाय्य,
 ‘descendant of Śūrpaṇāya,’ is the patronymic 
of a teacher, a pupil of Gautama, in the first two Vaṃśas (lists 
of teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇ
yaka Upaniṣad (ii. 5, 20; iv. 5, 26).

शौल्बायन
शौल्बायन
 or Śaulvāyana, ‘descendant of Śulba,’ is the 
patronymic of a teacher, Udaṅka.
	1 According to the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa,
	2 a Śaulbāyana was the Adhvaryu, or 
sacrificing priest, of those who had Ayasthūṇa as Gṛhapati 
(‘householder,’ the title of the sacrificer who has precedence at 
a sattra, or sacrificial session). 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 5, 4; 5, 4, 2; Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 1, 
2 Mādhyaṃdina. 2) xi. 4, 2, 17 et seq.

शौष्कल
शौष्कल
 is the name of one of the sacrificial victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 It means, 
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, ‘living on dried fish 
or flesh,’
	2 or, according to the native lexicographers, ‘selling 
dried fish,’ while, Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa explains the meaning to be one who catches fish with a 
hook, ‘angler.’ 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 16; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 12, 1. Cf. Weber, 
Indische Streifen, 1, 81, n. 7; Eggeling, 
Sacred Books of the East, 44, 415. 2) The literal meaning is, ‘relating to 
what is dried’ (śuṣkala).

श्रुष्टिआङ्गिरस
श्रुष्टि आङ्गिरस
 (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of 
the seer of a Sāman or Chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

Mythologie, 2, 160; Hopkins, Transactions 
of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, 15, 68.

श्मशान
श्मशान
 is the name of the ‘burial mound’ in which the 
bones of the dead man were laid to rest (cf. Anagnidagdha). 
It is mentioned in the Atharvaveda,
	1 and often later.
	2 The 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 prescribes a four-cornered mound facing 
the south-east, on ground inclined to the north, out of sight of 
the village, in a peaceful spot amid beautiful surroundings, or 
on barren ground. For an Agni-cit (‘builder of a fire-latar’) 
a funeral mound like a fire-altar is prescribed. The Easterners 
(Prācyāḥ) made their mounds round. 1) v. 31, 8; x. 1. 18. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 2, 8, 5;

श्मश्रु
श्मश्रु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 means ‘beard’ and 
‘moustache,’ being sometimes contrasted with Keśa,
	3 ‘hair of 
the head.’ Shaving was known (see Vaptṛ and Kṣura). The 
wearing of a beard was a sign of manhood according to the 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	4 with which agrees the notice of Mega
sthenes
	5 that the Indians carefully tended their beards up to the 
day of their death. 1) ii. 11, 17; viii. 33, 6; x. 23, 1, 4;

श्यापर्णसायकायन
श्यापर्ण सायकायन
 is the name of a man, the last for 
whom five victims were slain at the building of the sacrificial 
altar according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 The same text
	2 
again mentions him as a builder of the fire-altar. He must 
have been connected in some way with the Salvas.
	3 His 
family, the Śyāparṇas, appear in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	4 as a 
self-assertive family of priests whom king Viśvantara excluded 
from his sacrifice, but whose leader, Rāma Mārgaveya, induced 
him to take them back. In some way Śyāparṇa was connected 
with the defeat of the Pañcālas by the Kuntis.

श्यामजयन्तलौहित्य
श्याम-जयन्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the 
name of a teacher, a pupil of Jayanta Pārāśarya, in a Vaṃśa 
(list of teachers) in the Jiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 
1). Another man of the same name occurs in the same place 
as a pupil of Mitrabhūti Lauhitya.

श्यामपर्ण
श्याम-पर्ण
 is, in the Kāṭhaka
	1 and Maitrāyaṇī
	2 Saṃhitās, 
the name of a man who was instructed by Somadakṣa Kauśreya. 1) xx. 8 (Indische Studien, 3, 472). 2) iii. 2, 7.

श्यामसुजयन्तलौहित्य
श्याम-सुजयन्त लौहित्य
 (‘descendant of Lohita’) is the 
name of a teacher, a pupil of Kṛṣṇadhṛti Sātyaki, in a Vaṃśa 
(list of teachers) of the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 42, 1).

श्यामाक
श्यामाक
 is the name of a cultivated millet (Panicum frumen- 
taceum) in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 The 
lightness of its seed is alluded to in the Atharvaveda,
	3 where it 
is spoken of as blown away by the wind. There it is also 
mentioned as the food of pigeons.
	4 The Śyāmāka and its seed 
(Taṇḍula) are referred to as very small in the Chāndogya 
Upaniṣad,
	5 where Max Müller
	6 renders it as ‘canary seed.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 1, 2; ii. 3,

श्याव
1. Śyāva is the name of a protégé of the Aśvins in the 
Rigveda.
	1 He may be identical with Hiraṇyahasta. 1) i. 117, 24; x. 65, 2. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 150; 
Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 32.

श्याव
2. Śyāva is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 as a generous donor 
on the Suvāstu river. 1) viii. 19, 37. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 161.

श्याव
3. Śyāva in one passage of the Rigveda (v. 61, 9) seems 
clearly, as Sāyaṇa thinks, to denote Śyāvāśva.

श्यावक
श्यावक
 is mentioned as a sacrificer and friend of Indra in 
the Rigveda (viii. 3, 12; 4, 2). He may be identical with 
2. Śyāva.

श्यावसायन
श्यावसायन
 is the patronymic of Devataras in the Jaiminīya 
Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2). The form is perhaps an error 
for Śāvasāyana.

श्यावाश्व
श्यावाश्व
 is the name of a man mentioned several times in 
the Rigveda.
	1 The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a 
series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books.
	2 In one 
of the hymns
	3 Śyāvāśva mentions, apparently as his patrons, 
Taranta (a son of Vidadaśva) and Purumīlha, as well as 
Rathavīti. On this hymn is based a legend found in the 
Bṛhaddevatā,
	4 that he was the son of Arcanānas, who was 
sacrificing for Rathavīti Dālbhya. The father was anxious to 
obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though 
the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being 
a Ṛṣi. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home, 
when they met on the way Taranta and Purumīḍha, former 
patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while 
Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented Śyāvāśva with much wealth. 
The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the 
forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result 
the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to Śyāvāśva. 
Sieg
	5 seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda; 
but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the 
Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more 
than an epithet.
	6 That there is some Itihāsa at the back of the 
hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined. 
Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from Vaidadaśvi is referred to also 
in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.
	7 His name occurs in the 
Atharvaveda
	8 in two lists of persons, of which the former 
includes Purumīḍha, the latter also Arcanānas and Atri. A 
Sāman is ascribed to him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	9 and 
he is perhaps referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.
	10 In the 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	11 he 
is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of Arcanānas,’ and later
	12 he is called 
Ātreya, ‘descendant of Atri.’ 1) v. 52, 1; 61, 5. 9 (Syāva, a short 
form of the name, is here used); 81, 5; 
viii. 35, 19; 36, 7; 37, 7; 38, 8. 2) v. 52-61; 81; 82; viii. 35-38; ix. 32. 3) v. 61. 4) v. 49 et seq. See also Ṣaḍguruśiṣya 
on Anukramaṇī to Rv. v. 61 (ed. Mac
donell, p. 117 et seq.); Sāyaṇa on Rv. 
v. 61, 17-19; Nītimañjarī in Sieg, Die 
Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 50 et seq. 5) Op. cit.; 50-60. Cf. Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 3, 148. 6) v. 61, 6. The word is taken as 
an epithet by Roth, St. Petersburg 
Dictionary, s.v., and by Weber, Episches 
im vedischen Ritual, 27. 7) xvi. 11, 7-9. 8) iv. 29. 4; xviii. 3, 15. 9) viii. 5. 9. Weber, Episches im 
vedischen Ritual, 27, n. 4, bases on this 
an improbable conjecture that he was 
a Kṣatriya. 10) i. 11, 2. But cf. Sieg, op. cit., 61, 
n. 4, who takes the word adjectivally, 
as in Av. xi. 2, 18, Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, xix. 33, 26. 11) viii. 5, 9. 12) The Anukramaṇī calls him and 
his father Ātreya. In the passages 
from book viii. of the Rv., cited in 
n. 1, Atri is mentioned with him.

veda, 3, 126, 127; Oldenberg, Zeitschrift

श्येन
श्येन
 is the name in the Rigveda
	1 of a strong bird of prey, 
most probably the ‘eagle’; later
	2 (as in post-Vedic Sanskrit) 
it seems to mean the ‘falcon’ or ‘hawk.’ It is the swiftest of 
birds,
	3 and a source of terror to smaller birds.
	4 It is the 
strongest of birds,
	5 and even attacks herds.
	6 It watches over 
men (nṛ-cakṣas),
	7 a reference, no doubt, to its lofty flight in air. 
It brings the Soma from heaven.
	8 1) i. 32, 14; 33, 2; 118, 11; 163, 1; 
165, 2, etc. 2) Av. iii. 3, 4; vii. 41, 2; xi. 9, 9, etc. 3) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 4, 7, 1; v. 4, 
11, 1; Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iii. 8. 4) Rv. ii. 42, 2; Av. v. 21, 6. 5) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 14. 6) Rv. iv. 38, 5. This corresponds 
well enough with the eagle's known 
habit of carrying off young lambs. 7) Av. vii. 41, 2. 8) See Bloomfield, Journal of the 
American Oriental Society, 16, 1-24, who 
cites all relevant passages. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 87, 
88, who points out that the epithet 
ṛjipya, ‘flying upwards,’ applied to the 
eagle, appears as an actual name of the 
eagle in Iranian.

श्रपयितृ
श्रपयितृ,
 ‘cook,’ is a term mentioned in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa (i, 2, 2, 14).

श्रमण
श्रमण
 ‘mendicant monk,’ is first found in the Upaniṣads.
	1 
According to Fick,
	2 anyone could become a Śramaṇa. For the 
time of Megasthenes this seems indicated by his evidence, 
which, however, refers only to the east of India, beyond the 
Madhyadeśa proper.
	3 The Vedic evidence is merely the name 
and the fact that Tāpasa, ‘ascetic,’ follows it in the Bṛhad
āraṇyaka Upaniṣad and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, iv. 3, 22;

श्री
श्री
 is the regular word for ‘prosperity,’ found once in the 
Rigveda
	1 and often later.
	2 Śreṣṭhin. 1) viii. 2, 19, seems to have this sense. 2) Av. vi. 54, 1; 73, 1; ix. 5, 31;

Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 8, 6; v. 1, 
8, 6; vi. 1, 10, 3; vii. 2, 7, 3, etc. 
Already in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 
(xi. 4, 3) she is regarded as a goddess. 
See Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, 217 
et seq. She already appears in the 
earliest Buddhist sculptures seated on 
a lotus between two elephants that pour 
water over her. This type of the goddess 
has survived down to the present day 
in India.

श्रुतकक्ष
श्रुत-कक्ष
 is mentioned once in the Rigveda
	1 as the Ṛṣi of 
a hymn, the authorship of which the Anukramaṇī (Index) 
ascribes to him. A Sāman or chant of his is mentioned in the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

श्रुतर्य
श्रुतर्य
 occurs once in the Rigveda (i. 112, 9) as the name 
of a protégé of the Aśvins.

श्रुतर्वनार्क्ष
श्रुतर्वन् आर्क्ष
 (‘descendant of Ṛkṣa’) is the name of a 
prince whose liberality is celebrated in one hymn of the Rig
veda (viii. 74, 4. 13), and whose victory over Mṛgaya is 
mentioned in another (x. 49, 5).

श्रुतर्विद्
श्रुतर्-विद्
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda.
	1 1) v. 44, 12. Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 138, 139.

श्रुतसेन
श्रुत-सेन
 is mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 
4, 3) and the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 9, 4) as one of the 
brothers of Janamejaya.

श्रुषवाह्नेय
श्रुष वाह्नेय
 (‘descendant of Vahni’) Kāśyapa (‘descen
dant of Kaśyapa’) is the name of a teacher, a pupil of Deva- 
taras, in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 1). It is 
much more likely that Śruṣa is a mere misreading for Śūṣa.

श्रुष्टिगु
श्रुष्टि-गु
 (‘possessing obedient oxen’) is the name of a man 
in a Vālakhilya hymn of the Rigveda.
	1 1) viii. 51, 1. Cf. Ludwig, Translation 
of the Rigveda, 3, 140, 141; Hopkins, 
Journal of the American Oriental Society, 
17, 90.

श्रेणि
श्रेणि
 means a ‘row’ or ‘line’ of birds,
	1 or horses,
	2 or 
chariots,
	3 and so forth. 1) Rv. v. 59, 7. 2) Rv. i. 126, 4. 3) Rv. iv. 38, 6; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 
v. 14, 1.

श्रेष्ठिन्
श्रेष्ठिन्
 occurs in several passages of the Brāhmaṇas,
	1 
where the St. Petersburg Dictionary assigns to the word the 
sense of ‘a man of consequence.’ It is, however, possible that 
the word may already have the sense of the ‘headman of a guild,’ 
the modern Seth.
	2 There is a similar doubt in the use of 
śraiṣṭhya,
	3 which is perhaps not merely ‘the foremost place,’ as 
usually assumed, but definitely ‘the presidency of a guild.’ 
Guilds are referred to in the Dharma Sūtras,
	4 and they play a 
considerable part in the Buddhist texts
	5 and the Epic.
	6 But 
the Vedic evidence is inadequate to afford ground for positive 
assertion or denial of their existence or organization in Vedic 
times. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 30, 3; 
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxviii. 6; Kauṣī
taki Upaniṣad, iv. 20. Bhaga is the 
Śreṣṭhin of the gods, Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa, iii. 1, 4, 10. 2) Cf. Hopkins, India, Old and New, 
168 et seq. 3) Av. i. 9, 3 = Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 
iii. 5, 4, 2 = Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, v. 6 =

Upaniṣad, v. 2, 6; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, 
ii. 6; iv. 15, 20, etc. The use of 
śraiṣṭhya is, on the whole, not in favour 
of the theory that it is a technical term. 4) Gautama Dharma Sūtra, xi. 20, 21, 
etc.; Foy, Die königliche Gewalt, 14, n. 2,

श्रोत्रिय
श्रोत्रिय
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘Brahmin

	1 or Śrautarṣi,
	2 ‘descendant of Srutaṛṣi or 
Śrutarṣi,’ is the patronymic of Devabhāga. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 6. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 5; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 10, 9, 11.

श्रौमत्य
श्रौमत्य,
 ‘descendant of Śrumant,’ is the name of a 
teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 4, 5, 1).

श्लेष्मन्
श्लेष्मन्
 means generally that with which parts of a thing 
are joined together (from śliṣ, ‘join’): with reference to a hide,
	1 
‘laces’ of some sort may be intended; to a chariot,
	2 ‘bonds’ 
or ‘cords’ are probably meant; and to wood,
	3 ‘glue’ is perhaps 
the sense. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, v. 32, 6; Jaiminīya Upanisad Brāhmaṇa, iii. 17, 3; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, iv. 17, 4. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxiv. 9. Cf. 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvi. 1, 13, 
where a chariot (Ratha) is called śleṣ- 
mavant, ‘tied with ropes.’ 3) Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, vi. 12. Cf. 
the Upaniṣads, cited in n. 1, and 
Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, ii. 1, which 
looks like a bad secondary version of 
the passage in the Jaiminīya.

श्लोक
श्लोक,
 in the plural, is found enumerated after the Upaniṣads, 
and before the Sūtras, in the list of literary types given in the 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.
	1 In the Taittirīya Upaniṣad
	2 the 
Śloka-kṛt appears: he is rather the ‘poet,’ as Max Müller
	3 
renders it, than merely one who ‘calls aloud,’ as the St. Peters
burg Dictionary explains the term.
	4 Exactly what is meant 
cannot be said: ‘verses’ generally may be intended, several 
kinds being preserved in the Brāhmaṇas and called Ślokas.
	5 1) ii. 4, 10; iv. 1, 6 (Mādhyaṃdina = 
iv. 1, 2 Kāṇva); 5, 11. 2) iii. 10, 6. 3) Sacred Books of the East, 15, 69 4) In Av. v. 20, 7, the word has the 
sense assigned to it by the Dictionary. 5) E.g., Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, xi. 3, 1, 
5; 5, 4, 12; xiii. 7, 1, 15; Aitareya

श्लोण्य
श्लोण्य
 in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes ‘lameness,’ not 
‘skin disease’ (tvag-doṣa), as explained by the commentator. 1) iii. 9, 17, 2. Cf. śloṇa, ‘lame,’ Av. xii. 4, 3; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 1, 
6, 7, etc.

श्वघ्निन्
श्व-घ्निन्
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 clearly 
means a ‘gamester’ or ‘professional gambler.’ It may origin
ally have denoted a ‘hunter.’

श्वन्
श्वन्
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 is the word for ‘dog,’ the 
feminine being Śunī.
	3 The dog was a tame animal,
	4 and used 
to guard the house from thieves or other intruders.
	5 He was 
also employed in hunting the boar (varāha-yu),
	6 but was no 
match for the lion.
	7 A hundred dogs are mentioned as a gift in 
a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’) in a Vālakhilya hymn.
	8 Else
where the dog is regarded as unfit for sacrifice, as being 
unclean,
	9 and is driven away from the sacrifice.
	10 To eat dog's 
flesh was a last resort of despair and hunger.
	11 The bones of 
the feast were given to the dog.
	12 Saramā figures in legend 
as Indra's faithful dog
	13 searching for the cows. Rudra is lord 
of dogs (śva-pati) in the Yajurveda;
	14 the ‘dog-keeper’ 
(śvanin) is mentioned in the list of sacrificial victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the same Saṃhitā.
	15 The 
four-eyed (catur-akṣa) dogs of certain texts
	16 are, of course, 
mythological.

स्वपद्
स्व-पद्
 denotes a ‘savage animal,’ ‘beast of prey,’ in the 
Atharvaveda (viii. 5, 11; xix. 39, 4).

श्वयथ
श्वयथ
 in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 means ‘swelling.’ 
Possibly śīyathu, the disease prevalent in Videha according to the 
Baudhāyana Śrauta Sutra,
	2 was a kind of ‘swelling’ (? goitre). 1) iv. 2, 1, 11 (of the eye, in a 
myth). 2) ii. 5: Caland, Über das rituelle Sūtra 
des Baudhāyana, 35, 36.

श्ववर्त
श्व-वर्त,
 ‘found in dogs,’ is, according to some manu
scripts, the name of a species of worm in the Atharvaveda (ix. 4, 
16). See Śavarta.

श्वशुर
श्वशुर
 from the Rigveda onwards
	1 denotes the ‘father-in
law’ of the wife; not till the Sūtra period does it include the 
‘father-in-law’ of the husband.
	2 The daughter-in-law (Snuṣā), 
in the normal case when the father-in-law was the head of the 
family to which her husband belonged in fact as well as in age, 
was bound to pay him all respect.
	3 When the old man had 
ceased to exercise control, she became mistress (samrājñī) 
over him and his wife.
	4 In the plural
	5 the word denotes the 
‘parents-in-law.’ 1) x. 28, 1; 85, 46; 95, 4; Av. viii. 6, 
24; xiv. 2, 26, etc. 2) Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra, iii. 10, 46. 3) See Rv. x. 95, 4; Av. viii. 6, 24;

Saṃhitā, xii. 12 (Indische Studien, 5, 
260); Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 22, 7. 
So in Av. xiv. 2, 26, the daughter-in-law 
is to be ‘helpful’ to the father-in-law. 4) Rv. x. 85, 46. See Pati. 5) Rv. x. 95, 12; Av. xiv. 2, 27;

Verwandtschaftsnamen, 515, 516.

श्वश्रू
श्वश्रू
 denotes ‘mother-in-law’ of the husband
	1 as well as 
of the wife.
	2 She, together with her husband, if he became 
unable to manage the family,
	3 fell under the daughter-in-law's 
sway, but otherwise was entitled to regard.
	4 The gambler in 
the Rigveda
	5 complains of his having lost the favour of his 
wife's mother as one of the misfortunes brought upon him by 
dicing. 1) Rv. x. 85, 46; Av. xiv. 2, 26. 2) Rv. x. 34, 3. 3) Rv. x. 85, 46. 4) Av. xiv. 2, 26. 5) Rv. x. 34, 3.

श्वाजनि
श्वाजनि
 is the name of a Vaiśya in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad 
Brāhmaṇa (iii. 5, 2).

श्वापद
श्वापद,
 like Śvapad, denotes a ‘savage animal’ or ‘beast 
of prey.’ It is mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 in the Atharvaveda,
	2 
and occasionally later.
	3 1) x. 16, 6. 2) xi. 10, 8. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 10 
(where the tiger, Śārdūla, is mentioned 
as the chief of them); xii. 2, 4, 16; 
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 4, 29; 
Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka, xii. 16, etc.

श्वाविध्
श्वा-विध्
 (‘dog-piercing’) is the name of the ‘porcupine’ in 
the Atharvaveda
	1 and later.
	2 It is called ‘long-eared’ (karṇa).
	3 
See also Śalyaka. 1) v. 13, 9. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 20, 1;

saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 56; xxiv. 33, etc. 3) Av., loc. cit. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82.

श्विक्न
श्विक्न
 is the name of a people twice mentioned in the Sata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	1 in connexion with their king, Ṛṣabha Yājña- 
tura. Cf. Śvaikna. 1) xii. 8, 3, 7; xiii. 5, 4, 15. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 209, 210.

श्वित्र
1. Śvitra (‘white’) is the name of a species of serpent in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and the later Saṃhitās.
	2 1) iii. 27, 6 (where there is a variant 
citra); x. 4, 5, 13. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 2; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 13, 21, has in 
the parallel passage citra, probably by 
error. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 95; 
Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 134. Perhaps Śvitra, in the lis 
of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse 
sacrifice’) in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxiv. 39, has this sense; but the St. 
Petersburg Dictionary explains it as ‘a 
certain domestic animal,’ or, generally 
‘a white animal.’

श्वित्र
2. Śvitra is found as an adjective in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa (xii. 11, 11) in the sense of ‘afflicted with white leprosy.’

श्वित्र्य
श्वित्र्य
 See Śvaitreya.

श्वेतकेतु
श्वेत-केतु
 Aruṇeya
	1 (‘descendant of Aruṇa’) or Auddālaki
	2 
(‘son of Uddālaka’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. In the Kauṣītaki 
Upaniṣad
	3 he appears as Śvetaketu, son of Āruṇi, and as a 
Gautama. In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	4 he is quoted as an 
authority on the vexed question of the duty of the Sadasya, or 
the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to 
notify errors in the sacrifice; Āruṇi, his father, is also cited. 
He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating 
honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that 
delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students.
	5 He was a 
contemporary of, and was instructed by the Pañcāla king 
Pravāhaṇa Jaivala.
	6 He was also a contemporary of Janaka, 
of Videha, and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his 
court.
	7 A story is told of him in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra:
	8 Jala Jātūkarṇya was lucky enough to become the 
Purohita of three peoples or kings, of Kāśi, Kosala, and 
Videha. Seeing this, Śvetaketu felt annoyed and reproached 
his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely 
enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied, 
forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method 
of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it 
with every Brahmin. 
All the references to Śvetaketu belong to the latest period of 
Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpa
stamba Dharma Sūtra
	9 should refer to him as an Avara, or 
person of later days, who still became a Ṛṣi by special merit. 
His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which he plays so marked a part is 
certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that 
grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence 
500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for 
Śvetaketu as a rough approximation to a date.

material advantages accruing to the 
Purohita, to have been his concern 
in life. 9) i. 2, 5, 4-6. 10) See on this, Bühler, Sacred Books

श्वेत्या
श्वेत्या
 appears in the Nadī-stuti
	1 (‘praise of rivers’) to be a 
stream, probably a tributary of the Indus.
	2 1) x. 75, 6. 2) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14, 15; 
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
200, gives the form as Śvetī; Geldner, 
Rigveda, Glossar, 184, gives both forms.

श्वैक्न
श्वैक्न,
 ‘king of the Śviknas,’ is the title of Pratīdarśa, 
who was, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 one of those 
who offered the Dākṣāyaṇa sacrifice. He also taught Suplan 
Sārñjaya the sacrifice: hence Weber
	2 has inferred a connexion 
of the Śviknas and the Sṛñjayas. 1) ii. 4, 4, 3. 2) Indische Studien, 1, 209, 210.

श्वैत्रेय
श्वैत्रेय
 occurs in two passages of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
Sāyaṇa sees in the word the name of a man, a ‘descendant of 
Śvitrā.’ The first passage is almost identical with one in the 
sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda,
	2 where, however, Daśadyu 
appears alone without Śvaitreya. Ludwig
	3 identifies Daśadyu 
with Śvaitreya (‘son of Śvitrī’), and considers him a son of 
Kutsa.
	4 Bergaigne
	5 and Baunack
	6 think he is really Bhujyu. 
Geldner
	7 considers that he was a bull used for fighting, the son 
of a Śvitrā cow,
	8 but this is very doubtful, though the term 
śvaitreya is elsewhere applied to a bull.
	9 Śvitrya
	10 seems to 
have the same sense as Śvaitreya. 1) i. 33, 14; v. 19, 3. 2) vi. 26, 4. 3) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 
147. 4) Cf. Rv. i. 51, 6; vi. 26, 3, 4. 5) Religion Védique, 3, 11. 6) Kuhn's Zeitschrift, 35, 527. 7) Rigveda, Glossar, 7, 8. 8) Cf. śvaitarī, Rv. iv. 33, 1. 9) Keith, Journal of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, 1910, 935. 10) Rv. i. 33, 15, where Roth, St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., takes śvi- 
tryam as the accusative of śvitrī.

षण्ड
षण्ड
 is the name of a priest at the snake festival described 
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
	1 Cf. Kuṣaṇḍa. 1) xxv. 15, 3. Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 35.

षण्डिक
षण्डिक
 is mentioned in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā
	1 as a con
temporary of Keśin. Probably Khaṇḍika should be read as 
usual elsewhere. 1) i. 4, 12, where von Schroeder gives no variant. But ṣ and kh are constantly 
interchanged in manuscripts.

संरुध्
सं-रुध्
 and Saṃ-likhita occur in the Atharvaveda (vii. 
50, 5) as two technical terms, of unknown sense, used in dicing.

संवत्सर
सं-वत्सर,
 ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the 
Rigveda onwards.
	1 
It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of 
the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 360 days, divided into 12 months, 
being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however, 
it exceeded in length by 6 days.
	2 As a solar year it appears 
only in the Nidāna Sūtra
	3 of the Sāmaveda, where the sun is 
stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Nakṣatras. 
The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year 
(whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to 
effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As 
has been seen (see Māsa), the evidence goes strongly to show 
that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the Brāh
maṇa period, though there are traces of what may be re
garded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there 
is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really 
observed. 
Zimmer,
	4 indeed, considers that the evidence required is 
afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes 
enumerated as five: Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara, 
Idvatsara, and Vatsara;
	5 or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat
sara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara;
	6 or Saṃvatsara, Idāvatsara, Iduvat
sara, Idvatsara, Vatsara;
	7 or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat
sara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara;
	8 or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, 
Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara.
	9 But it must be noted not 
merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are 
mentioned in some places,
	10 in others
	11 three, in others
	12 two, 
and in yet others
	13 six. Moreover, in none of these enumera
tions is there any reference to the names being connected with 
a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we 
have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of 
Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine Saṃvatsara and 
Parivatsara as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key 
to the invention of the series is probably to be found in 
passages like that of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	14 where the 
several Cāturmāsya (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated 
with the different years.
	15 Particularly unjustifiable is the 
attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two 
years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the 
second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have 
existed before the Sūtra period. 
Zimmer
	16 also finds an attempt at intercalation in the 
famous 12 days in which the Ṛbhus are said to have slept in 
the house of Agohya.
	17 He thinks that they represent twelve 
days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of 
354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the rever
ence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers 
that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic.
	18 There can 
be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are 
merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ (saṃvatsarasya pratimā)
	19 in 
the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no 
relation to chronology at all. 
A reference to the use of Saṃvatsara alone as the fifth year 
of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry
	20 in the peculiar dating of 
certain notices in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	21 but this view 
is improbable.

संस्कन्ध
सं-स्कन्ध
 (‘having the shoulders together’) is the name 
of a disease mentioned with Viṣkandha in the Atharvaveda.
	1 
Whitney,
	2 however, thinks it is intended as an adjective 
implying the sense of ‘counteracting the disease Viṣkandha.’ 1) xix. 34, 5, with Sāyaṇa's note. 2) Translation of the Atharvaveda, 
952.

संहोत्र
सं-होत्र
 occurs once in the Rigveda,
	1 where Geldner
	2 
thinks the sense of ‘school,’ referring to a school of pupils of 
the ritual, is most appropriate. 1) x. 86, 10. 2) Vedische Studien, 2, 38.

सक्तु
सक्तु
 in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas
	1 denotes 
‘coarsely ground meal,’ ‘groats,’ especially ‘barley meal.’ In 
the Rigveda,
	2 where the word occurs only once, it seems rather 
to mean grain before it is winnowed by the Titaü. If the 
latter word, however, designates a ‘sieve,’ Saktu might still 
mean ‘groats,’ as opposed to fine meal. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 4, 10, 6; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xix. 21 et seq.;

सखि
सखि,
 ‘friend,’ is common from the Rigveda
	1 onwards,
	2 
both literally and metaphorically. 1) i. 164, 20 (of birds); iii. 43, 4 (of 
steeds); ii. 1, 9; v. 12, 5; vi. 75, 3, 
etc. 2) Av. v. 4, 7; 11, 9; 13, 5, etc. So 
sakhitva and sakhya, ‘friendship,’ are 
also common — e.g., Rv. i. 10, 6; iii. 1, 
15; iv. 25, 2, etc., and Rv. 1. 178, 2; 
ii. 18, 8; vii. 22, 9, etc.

Maitrāyaṇi Saṃhitā (iii. 1, 9).

सङ्गति|संगति
सं-गति
 in one passage of the Rigveda (x. 141, 4) seems to 
have the sense of Samiti, ‘assembly of the people.’

सङ्गव|संगव
सं-गव
 denotes the time when the grazing cows are driven 
together for milking. In the division of the day the word 
denotes the period before midday, ‘forenoon.’ It is found in 
the Rigveda
	1 and often later.

 is found in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	1 where it is 
said that the animals of the Bharatas in the evening were at 
the Goṣṭha, ‘pasture,’ but at midday came to the Saṃgavinī, 
apparently a shed or an enclosure in which during the heat of 
the day they were milked. 1) iii. 18, 14. Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 3, 112, 113; Zimmer, Altindisches

सं-ग्रहीतृ
 is found in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāh
maṇas.
	2 He is an official who figures among the Ratnins of 
the king. The sense of ‘charioteer’ seems adequate for every 
passage, but Sāyaṇa
	3 in some passages inclines to think that 
the meaning is ‘treasurer’ of the king. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 9, 2; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8 (as a Ratnin)

सङ्ग्राम|संग्राम
सं-ग्राम
 denotes primarily, it seems, ‘assembly’ either in 
peace
	1 or in war,
	2 when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal 
sense in the Atharvaveda
	3 and later
	4 is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’ 
Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been 
simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed 
every army, the two going together,
	5 and the foot soldiers being 
often overthrown by the charioteers,
	6 who were doubtless 
the Kṣatriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the 
foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for 
offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of 
the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded 
Greece.
	7 The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass 
(Varman), helmet (Śiprā), and hand-guard (Hastaghna) as a 
protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was 
the charioteer, and on his left the warrior (Sārathi, Savyaṣṭhā). 
Riding is never mentioned in war,
	8 and would hardly have 
been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on 
his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horse
back. The offensive weapon (Āyudha) was practically the 
bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used. 
Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host, 
such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems,
	9 and is also 
recognized in Germany by Tacitus,
	10 is uncertain (cf. Vrāta), 
but in the Epic relations (Jñāti) fight together,
	11 and this rule, 
no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also. 
Cities were besieged and invested (upa-sad, pra-bhid),
	12 
probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of 
assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and 
expensive. Hillebrandt
	13 thinks that the pur cariṣṇū of the 
Rigveda
	14 was a kind of chariot; it may — like the Trojan 
horse — have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means 
of assaulting a town. 
Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into 
neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal,
	15 
no doubt because of the booty (Udāja, Nirāja) which was to be 
won, and which the king had to share with the people. 
Banners (Dhvaja) were borne in war, and musical instru
ments (Dundubhi, Bakura)
	16 were used by the combatants. 1) Av. xii. 1, 56, where it is joined 
with Samiti. We might see in this 
passage, and that cited in n. 2, the 
technical name of the village assembly 
as opposed to the larger assemblies of 
the people, but there is no good warrant 
for so doing. 2) Av. iv. 24, 7, where saṃgrāmān is 
read; but the parallel passages (Tait
tirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 15, 2; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, iii. 16, 5) have saṃgrāmani. 3) v. 21, 7; xi. 9, 26. 4) Taittirīya Samhitā, ii. 1, 3, 1; 8, 4, 
etc. 5) Rv. ii. 12, 8. 6) Av. vii. 62, 1. Cf. Muṣṭihan 7) Herodotus, vii. 65. 8) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 296, 
where he admits riding to be men
tioned elsewhere; Whitney, Journal 
of the American Oriental Society, 3,

brandt, Vedische Mythologie, 1, 300, n. 13) Op. cit. 3, 289, n. 14) viii. 1, 2-8, where it is attributed

The shouts of either side are shown 
in the word krandas (Rv. ii. 12, 8; cf. 
vi. 25, 6; x. 121, 6), which came to 
mean the ‘shouting host.’ Cf. also

later Epic armour and warfare. See 
also his note, ibid., 15, 265, 266. For 
sacrifice in battle, cf. Purohita.

सङ्घात|संघात
सं-घात
 seems in a few passages
	1 to have the sense of 
‘battle.’ 1) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxix. 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, i. 16; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 1, 4, 18.

सचिव
सचिव
 ‘companion,’ ‘attendant’ (from sac, ‘follow’), later a 
common word for the comrade of a king, his minister, is found 
in Vedic literature in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 20, 1), where 
it is used by Indra of the Maruts. It seems to correspond in 
sense to the German comes or the English gesith.
	1 1) Stubbs, Select Charters, 57.

सजात
स-जात
 (‘born together’) is found once in the Rigveda,
	1 and 
very often later.
	2 The word must clearly mean a ‘relative,’ and 
then more widely a man of the same position or rank, but the 
senses cannot be distinguished, so much do they merge into 
each other. The Sajātas of a king are of course princes;
	3 of an 
ordinary man, Vaiśyas;
	4 of a military man, Kṣatriyas. But 
there is no clear reference to caste as in the later Sajāti
	5 (‘man 
of the same caste’). The disputes of Sajātas were notorious.
	6 1) i. 109, 1. 2) Av. i. 9, 3; 19, 3; ii. 6, 4; iii. 3, 6; 
vi. 5, 2; 73, 1; xi. 1, 6, 7; Taittirīya

often in the Brāhmaṇas. 3) Av. iii. 3, 4. 6; Weber, Indische 
Studien, 17, 188. 4) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 4, 4, 19 
(the Sajātas of a Grāmaṇī). 5) Manu, ix. 87; x. 41, etc. The 
abstract sajātya (‘kinship’) is found in 
Rv. ii. 1, 5; iii. 54, 16; viii. 18, 19; 
20, 21; 27, 10; x. 64, 13; but even it 
has no definite caste reference. 6) Cf. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 
12, 2.

सञ्चर|संचर
सं-चर
 in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	1 has the sense of the 
‘path’ of animals. Normally it is the term designating the 
‘passage’ or ‘space’ on the sacrificial ground used or occupied 
by the several persons taking part in the rite.
	2 1) v. 4, 3, 5. 2) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 9, 2, 4; 
iii. 1, 3, 28; Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
iii. 7, 11; Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
i. 3, 42, etc.

सञ्ज्ञान|संज्ञान
सं-ज्ञान,
 ‘concord,’ ‘harmony,’ is mentioned from the 
Rigveda
	1 onwards
	2 as a matter of great consequence; the 
Atharvaveda contains many spells to bring it about. The lack 
of peace in the Vedic village was almost inevitable in view of its 
small size and the economic interdependence of its inhabitants. 
Cf. Bhrātṛvya. 1) x. 19, 6. 2) Av. iii. 30, 4; vii. 52, 1; xi. 1, 26,

सतीन-कङ्कत
 
	1 is, in the Rigveda,
	2 the name of some

‘having a real comb.’ 2) i. 191, 1. 3) Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

सत्यकाम
सत्य-काम
 (‘lover of truth’) Jābāla (‘descendant of 
Jabālā) is the name of a teacher, the son of a slave girl by an 
unknown father. He was initiated as a Brahmacārin, or 
religious student, by Gautama Hāridrumata according to the 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad.
	1 He is often cited as an authority in 
that Upaniṣad
	2 and in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,
	3 where 
he learns a certain doctrine from Jānaki Āyasthūṇa.
	4 He is 
also mentioned in the Aitareya
	5 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇas.
	6 1) iv. 4, 1, et seq. 2) iv. 5, 1; 6, 2; 7, 2; 8, 2; 9, 10;

Upaniṣad,
	2 and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa.

latter text he is said to have been the pupil of Puluṣa Prācīna- 
yogya. 1) x. 6, 1, 1. 2) v. 11, 1. 3) iii. 40, 2 (in a Vaṃśa, ‘list of 
teachers’).

सत्यवचस्
सत्य-वचस्
 (‘true-speaking’) Rāthītara (‘descendant of 
Rathītara’) is, in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (i. 9, 1), the name of 
a teacher who insisted on the importance of truth.

सत्यश्रवस्
सत्य-श्रवस्
 (‘of true renown’) Vāyya (‘descendant of 
Vayya’) is the name of a Ṛṣi in the Rigveda.
	1 Ludwig
	2 thinks 
that he was the son of Sunītha Śaucadratha. 1) v. 79, 1 et seq. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 156.

सत्वत्|सत्वन्त्
सत्वन्त्
 is the name of a people who are stated in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 to belong to the south. In the Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa
	2 the defeat by Bharata of the Satvants, and his 
taking away the horse which they had prepared for an Aśva
medha (‘horse sacrifice’), are referred to: this reference clearly 
shows that in another passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 the 
text must be altered from satvanām to Satvatām, ‘of the Sat
vants,’ against whom it seems the Bharatas made regular raids. 
The name has also been found by the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
Cowell, and Max Müller in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad,
	4 but it is 
certain
	5 that the reading there is not Satvan-Matsyeṣu, but 
sa-Vaśa-Matsyeṣu. 1) viii. 14, 3. 2) xiii. 5, 4, 21. 3) ii. 25, 6. 4) iv. 1. 5) Oldenberg, Buddha, 393, n., cor

सदा-नीरा,
 ‘having water always’ (‘perennial’), is the name

	1 was 
the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas. The 
river is identified by the native lexicographers with the Kara
toyā,
	2 but this seems to be too far east. Weber's
	3 identification 
of it with the Gaṇḍakī
	4 is probably correct; for though the 
Mahābhārata

other being Navaka) who took part in the sacrifice of the 
Vibhindukīyas, which is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Brāh

सनश्रुत
सन-श्रुत
 (‘famed of old’) Ariṃdama (‘tamer of foes’) is 
mentioned as a Mahārāja in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (vii. 34, 9).

सनाच्छव
सनाच्-छव
 is perhaps the proper name of a teacher in the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.
	1 The Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā
	2 has Śahanāśchiva. 
Very probably the reading of both texts is bad. 1) xx. 1. 2) xxxi. 3 (von Schroeder, Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 2, 18, n. 5).

सनातन
सनातन
 is the name of a mythical Ṛṣi in the Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad

सन्दान|संदान
सं-दान
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘bond,’ 
‘halter,’ or ‘fetter.’ 1) i. 162, 8. 16. 2) Av. vi. 103, 1; 104, 1; xi. 9, 3;

सं-धा
 denotes in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas
	1 
an ‘agreement’ or ‘compact.’ 1) Av. xi. 10, 9, 15; Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, i. 7, 8, 4; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 7, 1, 6; ii. 1, 1, 3; Kauṣītaki Upani
ṣad, iii. 1.

सन्धि|संधि
सं-धि
 denotes the ‘juncture’ of heaven and earth, the 
‘horizon,’ in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	1 It also has the sense 
of ‘twilight’
	2 as the juncture of light and dark. 1) iii. 2, 1, 5; x. 5, 4, 2. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 25; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 5, 1; ii. 2, 9, 8;

सं-नहन
 in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas
	1 
denotes a ‘band’ or ‘rope.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 1, 2, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 3, 3, 6; ii. 6, 1, 
15, etc.

सपत्न
स-पत्न,
 ‘rival,’ is a common word in the later Saṃhitās,
	1 
being also found in the tenth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda.
	2 It is a 
curious masculine formed by analogy from Sa-patnī, ‘co-wife,’ 
and so ‘female rival.’ 1) Av. i. 19, 4; x. 6, 30; xii. 2, 46; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 6, 2, 2; iii. 2, 
8, 5, etc. 2) x. 166, 1, etc.; also in the com
pound sapatna-kan, ‘slaying rivals,’ x. 
159, 5, etc.; Av. i. 29, 5, etc.

सपत्नी
स-पत्नी
 occurs in the Rigveda in the sense of ‘co-wife’;
	1 in 
the first and the last Maṇḍalas it means co-wife as a ‘rival.’
	2 In 
post-Vedic Sanskrit the word becomes a synonym for ‘rival.’ 1) iii. 1, 10; 6, 4. 2) i. 105, 8; x. 145, 1-5 (cf. in verse 2, 
patim me kevalam kuru, ‘make my hus
band exclusively mine’).

सप्तगु
सप्त-गु
 is the reputed author of a Rigvedic hymn in a 
verse of which he is mentioned.
	1 1) x. 47, 6. Cf. Bloomfield, American Journal of Philology, 17, 423.

सप्तसिन्धवः
सप्त सिन्धवः,
 ‘the seven rivers,’ occur only once in the 
Rigveda as the designation of a definite country,
	1 while else
where
	2 the seven rivers themselves are meant. Max Müller
	3 
thinks that the five streams of the Panjab, with the Indus and 
the Sarasvatī, are intended; others
	4 hold that the Kubhā should 
be substituted for the Sarasvatī, or that perhaps the Oxus
	5 
must originally have been one of the seven. Zimmer
	6 is prob
ably right in laying no stress at all on any identifications; 
‘seven’ being one of the favourite numbers in the Rigveda and 
later. 1) viii. 24, 27. 2) Rv. i. 32, 12; 34, 8; 35, 8; 71, 7;

सप्तसूर्याः
सप्त सूर्याः,
 the ‘seven suns’ referred to in the Saṃhitās,
	1 
are named in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka
	2 as Āroga, Bhrāja, 
Paṭara, Pataṅga, Svarṇara, Jyotiṣīmant, and Vibhāsa, but these 
occur very rarely even later.
	3 Weber at one time
	4 thought 
that the seven planets (see Graha) were meant by the phrase, 
but later he abandoned the idea.
	5 Probably the ‘seven rays’ 
of the Rigveda
	6 are meant. 1) Av. xiii. 3, 10; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, 
xxxvii. 9. 2) i. 7. Cf. the ‘seven tongues’ of 
Agni which are mentioned in the Rig
veda, and each of which later receives 
an individual name: Macdonell, Vedic 
Mythology, p. 89. 3) Keith, Aitareya Āraṇyaka, 266;

सप्तमानुष
सप्त-मानुष
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 as an 
epithet of Agni, ‘belonging to the seven tribes.’ Hopkins
	2 
thinks that this is a reference to the seven ‘family’ books of 
the Rigveda (ii.-viii.), but this seems less likely than the view of 
Roth,
	3 that saptamānuṣa is equivalent to vaiśvānara. 1) viii. 39, 8. 2) Journal of the American Oriental Society, 16, 278. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

सप्तवध्रि
सप्त-वध्रि
 is the name of a protégé of the Aśvins, who 
appear from several passages of the Rigveda
	1 to have rescued 
him from a tree in which he had got fastened. He is men
tioned in the Atharvaveda.
	2 According to Geldner,
	3 he is 
identical with Atri. 1) v. 78, 5; viii. 73, 9; x. 39, 9. 2) iv. 29, 4. 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 190.

veda, 3, 156; Baunack, Zeitschrift der 
Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft,

सप्ति
सप्ति
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘swift steed.’ 1) i. 85, 1, 6; 162, 1; ii. 34, 7; iii. 22, 1, etc. 2) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 19, 22.

सप्त्य
सप्त्य
 in one passage of the Rigveda (viii. 41, 4) seems to 
denote a ‘racecourse.’

सबन्धु
स-बन्धु
 (‘of the same kin’) in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 
denotes ‘related.’ 1) iii. 1, 10; v. 47, 5; viii. 20, 21, 
etc. 2) Av. vi. 15, 2; viii. 2, 26; xv. 8, 
2. 3, etc.

सभा
सभा
 is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as 
well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often 
mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 but its exact character is 
not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing,
	3 presumably 
when the assembly was not transacting public business: a 
dicer is called sabhā-sthāṇu, ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubt
less because of his constant presence there.
	4 The hall also 
served, like the Homeric , as a meeting-place for social 
intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth,
	5 
possibly for debates and verbal contests.
	6 
According to Ludwig,
	7 the Sabhā was an assembly not of all 
the people, but of the Brahmins and Maghavans (‘rich 
patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions 
sabheya, ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin,
	8 rayiḥ 
sabhāvān, ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’
	9 and so on. But 
Bloomfield
	10 plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of 
Sabhā, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary 
in several passages
	11 as relating to a house, not to the assembly 
at all. Zimmer
	12 is satisfied that the Sabhā was the meeting
place of the village council, presided over by the Grāmaṇī. 
But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt
	13 seems 
right in maintaining that the Sabhā and the Samiti cannot be 
distinguished, and that the reference to well-born (su-jāta)
	14 
men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the 
Dāsa or Śūdra, not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the 
other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ (sabhya) a 
trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly 
when it met.
	15 
Women did not go to the Sabhā,
	16 for they were, of course, 
excluded from political activity. For the Sabhā as a court
house, cf. Grāmyavādin. There is not a single notice of the 
work done by the Sabhā. 1) vi. 28, 6; viii. 4, 9; x. 34, 6. Cf. 
sabhā-saha, ‘eminent in the assembly,’ 
x. 71, 10. 2) Av. v. 31, 6; vii. 12, 1, 2; viii. 10, 5; 
xii. 1, 56; xix. 55, 6; Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, i. 7, 6, 7; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
iv. 7, 4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; 
xvi. 24; xx. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 
i. 1, 10, 6; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 3, 
2, 3; v. 3, 1, 10; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, 
vii. 9, etc. 3) Rv. x. 34, 6; Av. v. 31, 6; xii. 3, 46 
(here dyūta is used in place of Sabhā). 4) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 18; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 16, 1, with 
Sāyaṇa's note. Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 172, inclines to see in the formula 
(Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, iii. 45; xx. 17; 
Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 8, 3, 1; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, ix. 4; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, 
i. 10, 2) ‘what sin we have committed 
in the village, the jungle, the Sabhā’ 
a reference to attacks on the great 
(Mahīdhara on Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
iii. 45), or partiality in deciding dis
putes (Mahīdhara, ibid., xx. 17). But 
it may refer to gambling or other non
political activity, as Eggeling, Sacred 
Books of the East, 12, 398, takes it, 
though he renders it differently, ibid., 
44, 265. 5) Rv. vi. 28, 6. Cf. viii. 4, 9. So 
in Av. vii. 12, 2, the assembly is hailed 
as nariṣṭā, ‘merriment.’ But the same 
hymn (vii. 12, 3) contains a clear refer
ence to serious speech in the Sabhā. 
For the blending of serious political 
work and amusement, cf. Tacitus, 
Germania, 22. 6) So Zimmer, op. cit., 174, takes 
sabheya in Rv. ii. 24, 13. 7) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 253
256. He quotes for this view Rv. 
viii. 4, 9; x. 71, 10 (passages which 
are quite vague). Cf. also Rv. vii. 1, 4; 
Av. xix. 57, 2. 8) Rv. ii. 24, 13. Cf. i. 91, 20; Av. 
xx. 128, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 22, 
etc. Max Müller, Sacred Books of the 
East, 32, 276, sees in sabheya the im
plication of ‘courtly manners,’ but this 
is rather doubtful; manner is not con
spicuous in Vedic society as in Homeric. 9) Rv. iv. 2, 5; in i. 167, 3, sabhāvatī 
is applied to ‘speech,’ or perhaps to 
yoṣā, ‘woman.’ 10) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 19, 13. 11) Av. viii. 10, 5 (where the sense 
is, however, clearly ‘assembly’; see 
viii. 10, 6); Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 
8, 6; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 10, 3; 
Chāndogya Upaniṣad, viii. 14 (but here 
the sense is certainly ‘assembly hall,’; 
see v. 3, 6, where the king is described 
as going to the assembly hall: sabhā-ga) 
The exact sense given by the St. Peters
burg Dictionary is the ‘society room’ 
in a dwelling-house. 12) Altindisches Leben, 174. But he 
ignores Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 4, 
14; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, v. 3, 6, 
which show that the king went to the 
Sabhā just as much as to the Samiti, 
and he cannot adduce any passage to 
show that the Grāmaṇī presided. 13) Vedische Mythologie, 2, 123-125. 14) Rv. vii. 1, 4. 15) Agni is sabhya, Av. viii. 10, 5; 
xix. 55, 6. For the Rv., see iii. 23, 4; 
v. 3, 11; vii. 7, 5. 16) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 172
174.

सभाचर
सभा-चर
 is one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha 
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 The St. Petersburg 
Dictionary thinks it is an adjective equivalent in sense to 
sabhā-ga,’ ‘going to the assembly.’ As he is dedicated to 
Dharma, ‘Justice,’ it is difficult not to see in him a member of 
the Sabhā as a law court, perhaps as one of those who sit 
to decide cases: there is nothing to show whether the whole 
assembly did so, or only a chosen body. The special use of 
Sabhācara suggests the latter alternative. See also Sabhāsad. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 6; Tait
tirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1 with 
Sāyaṇa's note. Cf. Weber, Indische 
Streifen, 1, 77, n. 1.

सभापति
सभा-पति,
 ‘lord of the assembly,’ is an epithet in the 
Śatarudriya.
	1 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 24; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 3, 2; Kāṭhaka 
Saṃhitā, xvii. 13, etc.

सभापाल
सभा-पाल
 is found in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 7, 4, 6), 
where the sense may be ‘guardian of an assembly hall.’

सभाविन्
सभाविन्
 in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 16, 1) denotes, 
according to the commentator Sāyaṇa, the ‘keeper of a 
gambling hall.’

सभासद्
सभा-सद्,
 ‘sitter in the assembly,’ is probably a technical 
description of the assessors who decided legal cases in the 
assembly (cf. Sabhācara). The term, which is found in the 
Atharvaveda
	1 and later,
	2 cannot well merely denote any member 
of the assembly. It is also possible that the Sabhāsads, perhaps 
the heads of families, were expected to be present at the Sabhā 
oftener than the ordinary man: the meetings of the assembly 
for justice may have been more frequent than for general discus
sion and decision. 1) iii. 29, 1 (of Yama); vii. 12, 2; 
xix. 55, 6. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, viii. 7; Maitrā

समङ्क
सम्-अङ्क
 is a word of obscure sense occurring in two 
passages of the Atharvaveda.
	1 Bloomfield
	2 renders it ‘hook’ 
in the first, and takes it to mean an insect destructive of grain 
in the other. 1) i. 12, 2; vi. 50, 1. 2) Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 7, 142. Cf. St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

समन
समन
 is a word of somewhat doubtful sense in the Rig
veda. Roth
	1 renders it either ‘battle’
	2 or ‘festival.’
	3 Pischel
	4 
thinks that it was a general popular festivity to which women 
went to enjoy themselves,
	5 poets to win fame,
	6 bowmen to gain 
prizes at archery,
	7 horses to run races;
	8 and which lasted until 
morning
	9 or until a conflagration, caused by the fires kept 
burning all night, scattered the celebrators.
	10 Young women,
	11 
elderly women,
	12 sought there to find a husband, and 
courtezans to make profit of the occasion.
	13 1) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2) Rv. vi. 75, 3. 5; ix. 96, 9; x. 143, 4;

as referring to men going to busi
ness. 10) Rv. x. 69, 11. Cf. vii. 9, 4. 11) Av. ii. 36, 1. 12) Rv. vii. 2, 5. 13) Rv. iv. 58, 8, where, as in vi. 75, 4; 
x. 168, 2, Roth sees the sense of ‘em
brace.’ The parallel with the festivals 
of Greece, where only young girls were 
able freely to mix with strangers, and 
which afforded the basis of so many 
of the comedies of the later school, is 
striking (cf. Mahaffy, Greek Literature, 
1, 2, 259 et seq.). 
Cf. Geldner, Rigveda, Glossar, 190.

समर
समर
 in the sense of ‘battle’ is found in the Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and, according to Geldner,
	2 in the Rigveda.
	3 1) vii. 9; Sāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
xv. 15, 12. 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 190. 3) vi. 9, 2 (at the sacrifice; cf. samarya, 
iv. 24, 8, etc.).

समा
समा
 appears originally to have denoted ‘summer,’ a sense 
which may be seen in a few passages of the Atharvaveda.
	1 
Hence it also denotes more generally ‘season,’ a rare use.
	2 
More commonly it is simply ‘year’;
	3 but in one place the Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa
	4 interprets it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	5 as 
meaning ‘month,’ a doubtful sense. 1) i. 35, 4; ii. 6, 1; iii. 10, 9. Cf. Whitney, Translation of the Atharva
veda, 36. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 25, 7;

समान

समानगोत्र
समान-गोत्र
 
	1 and Samāna-jana
	2 mean ‘belonging to the 
same family’ and ‘class’ respectively in the Brāhmaṇas. 
Samāna-bandhu, ‘having the same kin,’ is found in the 
Rigveda.

समान्त
समान्त
 (‘having the same boundary’), ‘neighbour,’ and 
therefore ‘foe,’ occurs in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (ii. 1, 24).

समिति
सम्-इति
 denotes an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic tribe. It is 
already mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 and often later,
	2 sometimes 
in connexion with Sabhā.
	3 Ludwig
	4 considers that the Samiti 
included all the people, primarily the viśaḥ, ‘subjects,’ but also 
the Maghavans and Brahmins if they desired, though the 
Sabhā was their special assembly. This view is not probable, 
nor is that of Zimmer,
	5 that the Sabhā was the village assembly. 
Hillebrandt appears to be right in holding that Samiti and 
Sabhā are much the same, the one being the assembly, the 
other primarily the place of assembly.
	6 
The king went to the assembly
	7 just as he went to the 
Sabhā. That he was elected there, as Zimmer
	8 thinks, is as 
uncertain as whether he was elected at all (see Rājan). But 
there are clear signs that concord between king and assembly 
were essential for his prosperity.
	9 
It is reasonable to assume that the business of the assembly 
was general deliberation on policy of all kinds, legislation so 
far as the Vedic Indian cared to legislate, and judicial work (cf. 
Sabhāsad). But of all these occupations there is, perhaps as a 
result of the nature of the texts, little or no evidence directly 
available. 
The gods had a Samiti, hence called daivī, ‘divine,’
	10 just as 
they had a Sabhā.
	11 
The assembly disappears as an effective part of government 
in the Buddhist texts,
	12 the Epic,
	13 and the law-books.

Samiti a place where any or much 
attention was paid to the views of the 
common man. Princes and great men 
spoke; the rest approved or disap
proved, as in Homeric times and in

समुद्र
सम्-उद्र
 (literally ‘gathering of waters’), ‘ocean,’ is a 
frequent word in the Rigveda and later. It is of importance in 
so far as it indicates that the Vedic Indians knew the sea. 
This is, indeed, denied by Vivien de Saint Martin,
	1 but not 
only do Max Müller
	2 and Lassen
	3 assert it, but even Zimmer,
	4 
who is inclined to restrict their knowledge of the sea as far as 
possible, admits it in one passage of the Rigveda,
	5 and of 
course later.
	6 He points out that the ebb and flow of the sea 
are unknown, that the mouths of the Indus are never men
tioned, that fish is not a known diet in the Rigveda (cf. Matsya), 
and that in many places Samudra is metaphorically used, as of 
the two oceans,
	7 the lower and the upper oceans,
	8 etc. In 
other passages he thinks that Samudra denotes the river Indus 
when it receives all its Panjab tributaries.
	9 It is probable that 
this is to circumscribe too narrowly the Vedic knowledge of the 
ocean, which was almost inevitable to people who knew the 
Indus. There are references to the treasures of the ocean,
	10 
perhaps pearls or the gains of trade,
	11 and the story of Bhujyu 
seems to allude to marine navigation. 
That there was any sea trade with Babylon in Vedic times 
cannot be proved: the stress Iaid
	12 on the occurrence in the 
Hebrew Book of Kings
	13 of qof and tukhiīm, ‘monkey’ (kapi) 
and ‘peacock,’ is invalidated by the doubtful date of the Book 
of Kings. There is, besides, little reason to assume an early 
date for the trade that no doubt developed later, perhaps 
about 700 B.C.
	14 
In the later texts Samudra repeatedly means the sea.

सम्राज्
सम्राज्
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 means ‘superior ruler, 
‘sovereign,’ as expressing a greater degree of power than ‘king’ 
(Rājan). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	3 in accordance with its 
curious theory of the Vājapeya and Rājasūya, the Samrāj is 
asserted to be a higher authority than a king, and to have 
become one by the sacrifice of the Vājapeya. There is, how
ever, no trace of the use of the word as ‘emperor’ in the sense 
of an ‘overlord of kings,’ probably because political conditions 
furnished no example of such a status, as for instance was 
attained in the third century B.C. by Aśoka. At the same time 
Samrāj denotes an important king like Janaka of Videha.
	4 It 
is applied in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	5 as the title of the eastern 
kings. Cf. Rājya. 1) iii. 55, 7; 56, 5; iv. 21, 1; vi. 27, 8;

given as follows: For the northerners 
it is Virāj: for the southerners, Svarāj; 
for the Satvants, Bhoja: for the middle 
people (Kuru-Pañcāla, Vaśa, and Uśī
nara), Rājan simply. This is probably 
a sound tradition.

सरयु
सरयु
 is mentioned thrice in the Rigveda as the name of 
river. Citraratha and Arṇa are said to have been defeated 
apparently by the Turvaśas and Yadus who crossed the 
Sarayu.
	1 Sarayu appears in one passage with Sarasvatī and 
Sindhu,
	2 and in another with Rasā, Anitabhā, and Kubha.
	3 
Later, in the post-Vedic period, Sarayū, rarely Sarayu, is the 
name of a river in Oudh, the modern Sarjū.
	4 Zimmer
	5 regards 
this as the river meant in all the Vedic passages, seeing in the 
last,
	3 which may be used as an argument for locating the 
Sarayu in the Panjab, a reference to the north-east monsoon as 
well as to the usual monsoon from the west. Hopkins
	6 thinks 
that the Sarayu is to be found in the west, and Ludwig
	7 
identifies it with the Kurum (Krumu). Vivien de St. Martin 
considered it to be probably identical with the united course of 
the Śutudrī (Sutlej) and Vipāś (Beas). 1) iv. 30, 18. This passage gives no 
help, because the possibility is open 
either to suppose that the Turvaśa, 
Yadu are not mentioned as defeating 
the Āryans Citraratha and Arṇa; or, 
if they are, to suppose that they may 
have come east against the two. 2) x. 64, 9. 3) v. 53, 9. 4) This is a tributary joining the 
Gogrā, the great river of Oudh, on 
the left of its upper course. The name 
Sarjū is also applied to the Gogrā itself 
below Bahrāmghāt. A branch of the 
Lower Gogrā, given off on the right, 
flowing in an old bed of the Gogrā, 
and falling into the Ganges after passing 
Balliā, is called the Chhotī (Lesser) 
Sarjū. Cf. Imperial Gazetteer of India,

सरस्वती
सरस्वती
 
	1 is the name of a river frequently mentioned in 
the Rigveda and later. In many passages
	2 of the later texts it 
is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses 
itself in the sands of Patiala (see Vinaśana). Even Roth
	3 
admits that this river is intended in some passages of the 
Rigveda. With the Dṛṣadvatī
	4 it formed the western boundary 
of Brahmāvarta (see Madhyadeśa). It is the holy stream of 
early Vedic India. The Sūtras
	5 mention sacrifices held on its 
banks as of great importance and sanctity. 
In many other passages of the Rigveda,
	6 and even later,
	7 
Roth held that another river, the Sindhu (Indus), was really 
meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is 
called the ‘foremost of rivers’ (nadītamā),
	8 is said to go to the 
ocean,
	9 and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which 
many kings,
	10 and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.
	11 
This view is accepted by Zimmer
	12 and others.
	13 
On the other hand, Lassen
	14 and Max Müller
	15 maintain the 
identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī.
	16 The 
latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as 
large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the 
sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron 
citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the 
Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive 
evidence of there having been any great change in the size or 
course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny 
that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there 
are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and 
the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine 
character of the river is been in the very hymn
	17 which refers 
to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with 
its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the 
Pārāvatas, a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa
	18 to have been in the east, a very long way 
from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again, 
the Pūrus, who were settled on the Sarasvatī,
	19 could with great 
difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes 
might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as 
they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the Bharatas 
in Kurukṣetra, and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded 
as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the 
‘seven rivers’ in one passage
	20 clearly designate a district: it 
is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the 
Indus and the Kubhā (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the 
Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river 
is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never 
followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did 
actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long 
distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappear 
ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	21 that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī, 
but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word Deśa 
shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those 
of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel 
in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an 
early production; if it is late it must refer to the later 
Sarasvatī. 
Hillebrandt,
	22 on the whole, adopts this view of the Saras
vatī,
	23 but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a 
mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,
	24 as well as the name of the 
Arghandab in Arachosia.
	25 This opinion depends essentially 
on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the 
scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh 
Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.
	26 Brunn
hofer
	27 at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but 
later
	28 decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

the Sarasvatī comes between the Jumna 
and the Sutlej, the position of the 
modern Sarsūti (Saraswatī), which, 
flowing to the west of Thanesar, is 
joined in Patiala territory by a more 
westerly stream, the Ghaggar, and, 
passing Sirsa, is lost in the desert at 
Bhatnair; but a dry river bed (Hakra 
or Ghaggar) can be traced from that 
point to the Indus. See Imperial Gasetteer 
of India, 26, Plate 32. Cf. also Oldham, 
Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 25, 
49-76. 17) Rv. ii. 41, 16 (devitame). 18) See Pārāvata, and cf. Bṛsaya. 19) Rv. vii. 95, 96. Ludwig, op. cit.,

meant here. See Hillebrandt. Vedische 
Mythologie, 1, 115. 20) Rv. viii. 24, 27. The connexion 
of Sarasvatī and the seven rivers is 
rather vague. In Rv. viii. 54, 4, Saras
vatī and the seven rivers are separately 
invoked, and in vi. 61, 10, 12, she is 
referred to as ‘seven-sistered’ (sapta- 
svasā). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the 
‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī 
one of the rivers. If the former passages 
are to be treated as precise, then sapta- 
svasā may be considered to show that 
the Sarasvatī was outside the river 
system (which would then be Indus, 
Kubhā, and the five rivers of the 
Panjab; see Sapta Sindhavaḥ); but 
the expression may be loosely meant 
for one of seven sisters. 21) xxxiv. 11. 22) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 99 et seq.;

devajana-vidyā. 2) i. 1, 10. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books

सर्पिवात्सि
सर्पि वात्सि
 (‘descendant of Vatsa’) is the name of a teacher 
in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	1 1) vi. 24, 15. Aufrecht, Altareya Brāh- 
maṇa, 424, takes the name to be Sarpir. 
The point is, of course, doubtful, since 
the word occurs in the nominative only.

सर्पिस्
सर्पिस्
 denotes ‘melted butter,’ whether in a liquid or 
solidified condition, and not differing from Ghṛta according to 
the St. Petersburg Dictionary. Roth there rejects the defini
tion cited by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa,
	1 which discriminates Sarpis as the liquid and Ghṛta as 
the solid condition of the butter. The word is repeatedly 
mentioned in the Rigveda
	2 and later.
	3 1) i. 3, 5. 2) i. 127, 1; v. 6, 9; x. 18, 7. 3) Av. i. 15, 4; ix. 6, 41; x. 9, 12; 
xii. 3, 45; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 
10, 1, etc.

सर्वचरु
सर्व-चरु
 is found in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 
and of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,
	2 where the gods are referred 
to as holding a sacrifice sarvacarau. The word is the name of 
a man according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary; the name 
of a place
	3 seems possible, or even a mere adjective may be 
meant.
	4 1) vi. 1, 1. 2) xxix. 1. 3) Sāyaṇa on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 
loc. cit. 4) Aufrecht, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 425, 
n. 1, who suggests that yajñe is to be 
supplied.

सर्ववेदस
सर्व-वेदस
 denotes in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāh
maṇas either a sacrifice in which the sacrificer gives his all to 
the priests,
	1 or the whole property of a man.
	2 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 7, 7;

सर्षप
सर्षप,
 denoting ‘mustard’ or ‘mustard seed,’ occurs only 
a few times in later Vedic texts.

Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, v. 2; Śāṅkhāyana

सलिलवात
सलिल-वात
 occurs in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās
	1 as an adjec
tive meaning ‘favoured with a wind from the water.’
	2 It 
probably refers to the wind from the ocean, the south-west 
monsoon.
	3 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 4, 12, 3; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxiv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, iii. 16, 4. 2) Or, according to the commentator, 
salilākhyena vāta-viśeṣeṇa anugṛhītaḥ, 
‘favoured by a kind of wind called 
Salila.’ 3) Indian Empire, 1, 110. The mon
soon is little noted in the Vedic texts, 
except in so far as the Marut hymns 
may be deemed to be a description of 
the monsoon. See Rv. i. 19, 7; 37, 
6 et seq.; 38, 8; 64, 8; 88, 5; v. 83, 
1 et seq.; 85, 4; Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 42-44.

सल्व
सल्व
 is the name of a people mentioned in a passage of the 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 which records a boast by Śyāparṇa 
Sāyakāyana that if a certain rite of his had been completed, 
his race would have been the nobles, Brahmins, and peasants 
of the Salvas, and even as it was his race would surpass 
the Salvas. This people appears also to be alluded to as 
Sālvīḥ (prajāḥ) in the Mantra Pāṭha,
	2 where they are said to 
have declared that their king was Yaugandhari when they 
stayed their chariots
	3 on the banks of the Yamunā. There is 
later evidence
	4 indicating that the Sālvas or Śālvas were 
closely connected with the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that apparently 
some of them, at least, were victorious near the banks of 
the Yamunā. There is no good evidence to place them in the 
north-west in Vedic times.
	5 1) x. 4, 1, 10. 2) ii. 11, 12. 3) Winternitz, Mantra-pāṭha, xlv-xlvii, 
sees in the verse an allusion to the 
Sālva women turning round the wheel 
(? spinning-wheel). But a reference 
to a warlike raid seems more plau
aible. 4) Mahābhārata, iv. 1, 12; viii. 44 
(45), 14. The Yugandharas are also 
referred to in a Kārikā quoted in the 
Kāśikā Vṛtti on Pāṇini, iv. 1, 173. 5) Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 1, 215.

सव्यष्ठा
सव्य-ष्ठा,
 
	1 Savya-ṣṭhṛ,
	2 Savye-ṣṭha,
	3 and Savya-stha
	4 
are all various forms of the word for ‘car-fighter,’ as opposed 
to Sārathi, ‘charioteer,’ showing that, as was natural, the 
fighter stood on the left of the driver. The commentators
	5 are 
inclined to see in the Savyaṣṭhā merely another ‘charioteer,’ 
but this is quite unjustifiable,
	6 and is perhaps due to later caste 
prejudice against a Śūdra charioteer. 1) Av. viii. 8, 23. 2) Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 2, 4, 9;

 in the Rigveda
	1 denotes ‘herb’ or ‘grass.’
	1 The word 
is also applied to the Soma plant
	2 and the sacrificial straw.

ससर्परी
ससर्परी
 is a word occurring in two curious verses of the 
Rigveda.
	1 According to a later interpretation,
	2 it designates a 
particular kind of skill in speech which Viśvāmitra obtained 
from Jamadagni. What it was is quite uncertain. 1) iii. 53, 15, 16. 2) Bṛhaddevatā, iii. 113, with Macdonell's notes. 
Cf. Geldner, Vedische Studien, 2, 159.

सस्य

 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 regularly denotes 
‘corn’ generally. It corresponds to the Avestan hahya. See 
Kṛṣi. 1) vii. 11, 1; viii. 10, 24. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 4, 3, 3;

Cf. Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, 284.

सह
सह
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 is, according to Roth,
	2 the name of 
a plant, but Bloomfield
	3 thinks the word is only an adjective 
meaning ‘mighty.’ 1) xi. 6, 15. Cf. Sāmavidhāna Brāh

सहदेव
सह-देव
 is the name of a prince in the Rigveda,
	1 where he 
is victorious over the Śimyus and Dasyus. It is quite prob
able that he is identical with King Sahadeva Sārñjaya, who is 
mentioned in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	2 as having once been 
called Suplan Sārñjaya, and as having changed his name 
because of his success in performing the Dākṣāyaṇa sacrifice. 
In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	3 he is mentioned with Somaka 
Sahadevya, who also appears in the Rigveda.
	4 1) i. 100, 17. 2) ii. 4, 4, 3. 4. Cf. xii. 8, 2, 3. 3) vii. 34, 9. 4) iv. 15, 7 et seq.

सहदेवी
सह-देवी
 is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda
	1 
according to the reading of the commentary. 1) vi. 59, 2. Cf. Grill, Hundert Lieder,^2 
163; Whitney, Translation of the Athar
vaveda, 325; Bloomfield, Hymns of the 
Atharvaveda, 490, who does not accept 
this reading. A plant called Sahadeva 
occurs in the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa, 
ii. 6, 10.

सहमान
सहमान
 is the name of a plant in the Atharvaveda (ii. 25, 
2; iv. 17, 2; viii. 2, 6; 7, 5).

सहोजित्
सहो-जित्
 See Jaitrāyaṇa.

सांवरणि
सांवरणि
 is found in the Rigveda
	1 in one passage, where it 
naturally seems to be a patronymic (‘descendant of Saṃ
varaṇa’) of Manu. According to Bloomfield,
	2 it is a corrup
tion for Sāvarṇi, a reference to Manu's birth from the savarṇā, 
‘similar’ female who was substituted for Saraṇyū according to 
the legend (see Manu). This is possible, but not certain. 
Scheftelowitz
	3 thinks that the reading of the Kaśmir manu
script of the Rigveda, which has sāṃvaraṇam, ‘found on the 
sacrificial ground,’ as an epithet of Soma, is to be preferred. 
But this seems quite improbable.
	4 We must either recognize 
a real man called Manu Sāṃvaraṇi; or take Manu as one name, 
Sāṃvaraṇi as another; or admit that Manu Sāṃvaraṇi is 
simply Manu with a patronymic derived from an unknown 
legend. 1) viii. 51, 1. 2) Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 15, 180, n. 3) Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda, 38. 4) See Oldenberg, Göttingische Gelehrte

the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka (xv. 1).

सांकृतीपुत्र
सांकृती-पुत्र
 (‘son of a female descendant of Saṃkṛta’) is 
the name of a teacher, a pupil of Ālambāyanīputra
	1 or Ālambī- 
putra,
	2 in the last Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Bṛhadāraṇ
yaka Upaniṣad. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 5, 2 Kāṇva. 2) Ibid., vi. 4, 32 Mādhyaṃdina.

teachers) in the Mādhyaṃdina recension of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad.

viii. 21; x. 21; xvi. 16.

साचीगुण
साची-गुण
 is mentioned, apparently as a place in the territory 
of the Bharatas, in a verse occurring in the Aitareya Brāh
maṇa.
	1 Leumann,
	2 however, thinks an epithet of Indra, 
Śācīgu, may be meant. 1) viii. 23, 4. 2) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 48, 80, n. 5. This 
conjecture seems improbable.

सांजीवीपुत्र
सांजीवी-पुत्र,
 ‘son of Sāṃjīvī,’ is the name of a teacher 
who appears in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) at the end of the 
tenth Kāṇḍa of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and at the end of 
the fourteenth Kāṇḍa in the Kāṇva recension,
	2 as a pupil of 
Māṇḍūkāyani. In the Vaṃśas at the end of the Bṛhadāraṇ
yaka Upaniṣad in both recensions
	3 he is given as a pupil of 
Prāśnīputra Āsurivāsin. It seems clear that he united in 
himself two lines of teachers — that of the tradition of the fire
cult from Śāṇḍilya, and that of the tradition of Yājñavalkya. 1) x. 6, 5, 9. 2) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, vi. 5.

is known to the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.
	2 The Taittirīya Brāh
maṇa
	3 and the Rigveda
	4 itself contain clear references to 
horse-riding, while the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	5 refers to mounting a 
horse sideways. Āśvalāyana
	6 knows sādya as a ‘riding horse’ 
opposed to vahya, a ‘draught animal.’ 1) xi. 10, 24. 2) xxx. 13. 3) iii. 4, 7, 1. 4) i. 162, 17; v. 61, 3. Cf. i. 163, 9. 5) i. 2, 4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, vii. 3,

सार्ञ्जय
सार्ञ्जय
 is found in the Rigveda
	1 in a Dānastuti (‘praise of

rather than a ‘descendant of Sṛñjaya.’ According to the 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	2 he was Prastoka, mentioned, in the 
same hymn, but this conclusion is not very cogent. He was 
clearly a patron of the Bharadvājas. The same epithet 
belongs to Sahadeva, alias Suplan.

सार्व-सेनि
 (‘descendant of Sarvasena’) is the patronymic of 
Śauceya in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (vii. 1, 10, 3).

सालावृक
साला-वृक
 is found twice in the Rigveda
	1 apparently denoting 
the ‘hyæna’ or ‘wild dog.’ This sense also seems appropriate 
in the later narrative of the destruction of the Yatis by Indra,
	2 
who is said to have handed them over to the Sālāvṛkas. Sālā
vṛkeya
	3 is a variant form of the same word, meaning literally 
‘descendant of a Sālāvṛka.’ The feminine is Sālāvṛkī,
	4 but in 
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā
	5 it appears as Salāvṛkī. Cf. Tarakṣu. 1) x. 73, 2; 95, 15. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 2, 7, 5;

‘jackal.’

सावयस
सावयस
 (‘descendant of Savayasa’) is the patronymic of 
Aṣāḍha, or Āṣāḍha, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (i. 1, 1, 7).

सावर्णि
सा-वर्णि
 is found as a patronymic in the Rigveda
	1 together 
with Sāvarṇya.
	2 It is clear that no man called Savarṇa ever 
existed, though Roth
	3 accepted that view, and that the refer
ence is to the mythical Manu Sāvarṇi, the descendant of the 
sa-varṇā female, who, according to the legend,
	4 took the place 
of Saraṇyū. 1) x. 62, 11. 2) x. 62, 9. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Cf.

सिंह
सिंह
 denotes the ‘lion’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 The 
roaring (nad) of the lion is often alluded to,
	2 and is called 
thundering (stanatha).
	4 He wanders about (ku-cara) and lives 
in the hills (giri-ṣṭha),
	5 and is clearly the ‘dread wild beast that 
slays’ (mṛgo bhīma upahatnuḥ)
	6 to which Rudra is compared. 
When Agni, who has entered the waters, is compared to a 
lion,
	7 the reference may be to the lion's habit of springing on 
animals at drinking places. That a jackal should defeat the 
lion is spoken of as a marvel.
	8 The lion, being dangerous to 
men,
	9 was trapped,
	10 lain in wait for in ambush,
	11 or chased by 
hunting bands.
	12 But dogs were terrified of lions.
	13 The 
lioness (siṃhī) was also famous for her courage: the aid given 
by Indra to Sudās against the vast host of his enemies is 
compared to the defeat of a lioness by a ram (Petva).
	14 The 
gaping jaws of the lioness when attacking men are alluded to in 
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	15 The lioness is also mentioned in 
the Yajurveda Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.

सिच्
1. Sic denotes the ‘border’ of a garment. The Rigveda 
refers to a son clutching the hem of his father's robe to attract 
his attention,
	1 and to a mother's covering her son with the edge 
of her garment.
	2 The word also occurs later.

सिच्
3. Sic seems in one passage of the Rigveda (i. 95, 7), where it 
is used in the dual, to denote the ‘horizon’ (meaning literally 
the ‘two borders’; i.e., of heaven and of earth).

सिध्मल
सिध्मल,
 ‘leprous,’ is found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 
(xxx. 17) and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 4, 14, 1) as a 
designation of one of the victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human 
sacrifice’). Cf. Kilāsa.

सिनीवाली
सिनीवाली
 denotes the day of new moon and its presiding 
spirit, which, in accordance with widespread ideas concerning 
the connexion of the moon and vegetation, is one of fertility 
and growth. It occurs very frequently from the Rigveda
	1 
onwards.

सिन्धु
सिन्धु
 in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 often means 
‘stream’ merely (cf. Sapta Sindhavaḥ), but it has also
	3 the 
more exact sense of ‘the stream’ par excellence, ‘the Indus.’ 
The name is, however, rarely mentioned after the period of the 
Saṃhitās,
	4 always then occurring in such a way as to suggest 
distance. The horses from the Indus (saindhava) were famous.

सिन्धुक्षित्

 which the commentator reads as Śalāñjālā, is the 
name of a plant, perhaps a ‘grain creeper,’ in the Atharvaveda.

सीता
सीता,
 ‘furrow,’ occurs in the Rigveda,
	1 and often later.

of Rigvedic hymns, and probably 
late). 2) Av. xi. 3, 12; Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

सीर
सीर,
 ‘plough,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 and often later.
	2 
It was large and heavy, as is shown by the fact that six oxen,
	3 
or eight,
	4 or twelve,
	5 or even twenty-four,
	6 were used to drag it. 
The animals which drew the plough were oxen, which were, no 
doubt, yoked and harnessed with traces.
	7 The ox was guided 
by the Aṣṭrā, or ‘goad,’ of the ploughman (cf. Vaiśya).
	8 Little 
is known of the parts of the plough. See Lāṅgala and Phāla. 1) iv. 57, 8; x. 101, 3, 4. 2) Av. vi. 30, 1; 91, 1; viii. 9, 16,

in x. 102, 8. It may denote the fastening 
of the ox to the yoke rather than to 
the plough by traces. 8) Cf. Rv. iv. 57, 4; x. 102, 8.

सील
सील,
 ‘plough,’ is found in the Kapiṣṭhala Saṃhitā 
(xxviii. 8).

सीलमावती
सीलमावती
 in the Rigveda
	1 is, according to Ludwig,
	2 the 
name of a river; but this is most improbable.
	3 Sāyaṇa thinks 
the word means ‘rich in hemp.’ 1) x. 75, 8. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 200. 3) Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 429; 
Böhtlingk, Dictionary, s.v.; Geldner,

सीस
सीस,
 ‘lead,’ occurs first in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it is 
mentioned as used for amulets.
	2 The word is then quite 
common.
	3 The use of lead by the weaver as a weight is perhaps 
also referred to.

view of Roth, St. Petersburg Dic
tionary, s.v., and of Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 53. But Griffith, Translation of 
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 183, n., thinks 
that in xix. 80 lead is referred to not 
as a weight, but as a charm against 
demons and sorcery.

Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa (i. 14, 4).

सुजात
सु-जात,
 ‘well-born,’ is an epithet found applied to men in a 
few passages of the Rigveda. It would probably be a mistake 
to press the sense so as to denote ‘nobles’ as compared with 
the people. See Sabhā.

सुतं-भर
 is credited by the Anukramaṇī (Index) with 
the authorship of certain hymns of the Rigveda.
	1 The word 
does not occur in those hymns, but it appears as an adjective 
(‘carrying away Soma’) elsewhere,
	2 and may, in a second 
passage,
	3 by a conjecture
	4 be taken as a man's name. 1) v. 11-14. 2) v. 44, 13. 3) ix. 6, 6. 4) If sutaṃ-bharāya be read for sutdṃ

of a teacher who was a pupil of Janaśruta Vārakya.

सुदामन्
सु-दामन्
 is the name of a river in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa (xxii. 18, 1).

सुदास्
सु-दास्
 is the name of the Tṛtsu king who won a famous 
victory over the ten kings, as described in a hymn of the 
Rigveda.
	1 At one time Viśvāmitra was his Purohita, and 
accompanied him in his victorious raids over the Vipāś 
(Beās) and Śutudrī (Sutlej).
	2 The Aśvins gave him a queen, 
Sudevī,
	3 and also helped him on another occasion.
	4 He 
appears with Trasadasyu in a late hymn without hint of 
rivalry,
	5 but elsewhere he seems to be referred to as defeated by 
Purukutsa, Trasadasyu's father.
	6 In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	7 
he is recognized as a great king, with Vasiṣṭha as his Puro 
hita, and similarly in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,
	8 where his 
generosity to his priest is related. 
His exact ancestry is a little uncertain, because he is called 
Paijavana, ‘son of Pijavana,’ as Yāska explains the patro
nymic. If this explanation is correct, Divodāsa must have 
been his grandfather. If he was the son of Divodāsa, Pijavana 
must be understood as a more remote ancestor. The former 
alternative seems the more probable. Cf. Turvaśa, Dāśarājña.

सुपर्ण
1. Su-parṇa, ‘well-winged,’ designates a large bird of prey, 
the ‘eagle’ or the ‘vulture,’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 In 
the passages in which it appears as an eater of carrion
	3 it must 
be the vulture. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa
	4 mentions an eagle 
which separates milk from water like the Kruñc. In the 
Rigveda
	5 the Suparṇa is said to be the child of the Śyena, and 
is distinguished from the latter in another passage:
	6 this led 
Zimmer
	7 to think that the falcon is probably meant.
	8 The 
Atharvaveda alludes to its cry,
	9 and describes it as living in

a Ṛṣi. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3, 3, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxix. 7.

सुपित्र्य
सु-पित्र्य,
 a word occurring once in the Rigveda,
	1 is prob
ably an adjective (‘maintaining his paternal character well’). 
Ludwig,
	2 however, regards it, but without any great prob
ability, as a proper name. 1) x. 115, 6. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 169.

सुप्रतीतऔलुण्ड्य
सु-प्रतीत औलुण्ड्य
 is the name of a teacher, a pupil of 
Bṛhaspatigupta, in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

सुप्लन्सार्ञ्जय
सुप्लन् सार्ञ्जय
 is the name of a prince of the Sṛñjayas 
who was taught the Dākṣāyaṇa sacrifice by Pratīdarśa, and 
took the name of Sahadeva as a token of his success.
	1 1) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 4, 4, 4; 
xii. 8, 2, 3. Cf. Lévi, La Doctrine du 
Sacrifice, 139; Hillebrandt, Vedische 
Mythologie, 1, 105, 106.

सुबन्धु
सु-बन्धु
 in the hymns of the Rigveda
	1 is taken by Sāyaṇa 
to be a proper name; but this is not certain, Roth
	2 seeing in 
the passages only an ordinary noun meaning ‘a good friend.’ 
The later tradition
	3 explains that Subandhu and his brothers, 
called Gaupāyanas, were priests of Asamāti, who cast them off 
and took two others, Kirāta and Ākuli. By these two in 
pigeon form Subandhu was caused to swoon, but was revived 
by his three brothers, who recited certain hymns.

सुब्रह्मण्य
सु-ब्रह्मण्य
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 denotes a priest who 
officiates as one of the three assistants of the Udgātṛ (see Ṛtvij). 
His office is Subrahmaṇyā.

सुभगा
सु-भगा,
 in the vocative subhage, is a frequent form of 
courteous address to women from the Rigveda onwards.
	1 1) Rv. x. 10, 10. 12; 108, 5; Av. v. 5, 6; vi. 30, 3, etc.

सुभद्रिका
सु-भद्रिका
 occurs in the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) 
section of the Yajurveda
	1 as in some way connected with the 
rite. Weber
	2 thinks that a proper name, that of the wife of the 
king of Kāmpīla, is intended, but Mahīdhara
	3 explains the 
word merely as a lady with many lovers or a courtezan, a view 
followed by Roth.
	4 Since the Taittirīya
	5 and Kāṭhaka
	6 Saṃ
hitās have no Subhadrikā, but a vocative subhage (see Subhagā), 
the sense remains very doubtful. 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiii. 18 (cf.

सुरा
सुरा
 is the name of an intoxicating ‘spirituous liquor,’ 
often mentioned in Vedic literature. In some passages
	1 it is 
referred to favourably, in others with decided disapproval.
	2 It 
is classed with the use of meat and with dicing as an evil in the 
Atharvaveda,
	3 and often with dicing.
	4 It was, as opposed to 
Soma, essentially a drink of ordinary life.
	5 It was the drink of 
men in the Sabhā,
	6 and gave rise to broils.
	7 
Its exact nature is not certain. It may have been a strong 
spirit prepared from fermented grains and plants, as Eggeling
	8 
holds, or, as Whitney
	9 thought, a kind of beer or ale. 
Geldner
	10 renders it ‘brandy.’ It is sometimes mentioned in 
connexion with Madhu.

where he is mentioned with Ambarīṣa and others.

सुराम
सुराम
 in the Rigveda
	1 refers to the illness caused by 
drinking Surā to excess. Indra is described as suffering from 
it in the Namuci legend.
	2 Later Surāma
	3 was treated as an 
epithet of Soma, meaning ‘delightful.’ 1) x. 131, 5. 2) Bloomfield, Journal of the American

hitā, xxi. 42; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,

‘Surā mixed,’ which is doubtful.

सुवर्ण
सु-वर्ण,
 ‘beautiful coloured,’ is an epithet of gold (Hiraṇya), 
and then comes to be used as a substantive denoting ‘gold.’

	1 
and is also used adjectivally, ‘clothing well.’

सुवास्तु
सु-वास्तु
 (‘having fair dwellings’) is the name of a river in the 
Rigveda.
	1 It is clearly the Soastos of Arrian
	2 and the modern 
Swāt, a tributary of the Kubhā (Kabul river) which is itself an 
affluent of the Indus. 1) viii. 19, 37; Nirukta, iv. 15. 2) Indica, iv. 11.

Ūrjayant Aupamanyava, in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa.

	1 1) Indische Studien, 4, 372.

सुषामन्
सु-षामन्
 is the name of a man in one verse of the Rigveda,
	1 
and probably forms part of the strange name, Varo Suṣāman, 
in other passages.
	2 Cf. Varu. 1) viii. 25, 22; possibly 60, 18. 2) viii. 23, 28; 24, 28; 26, 2. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 162.

सुषोमा
सु-षोमा
 occurs certainly as the name of a river in the Nadī
stuti (‘praise of rivers’) in the Rigveda.
	1 In two other passages 
it would seem to be a proper name, once masculine,
	2 perhaps 
the people, and once feminine,
	3 though Roth
	4 sees in the word 
the designation of a Soma vessel. Its identification is quite 
uncertain, though it has been thought to be the  of 
Megasthenes,
	5 the modern Suwan. 1) x. 75, 5; Nirukta, ix. 26, where it is absurdly identified with the Sindu 
(Indus). 2) viii. 7, 29. 3) viii. 64, 11. 4) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 2. 5) See Arrian, Indica, iv. 12; Schwan
beck, Megasthenes, 31, where there is a 
various reading .

of the East, 32, 398, 399; Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 12-14.

सुसर्तु
सु-सर्तु
 is the name of a river in the Nadī-stuti (‘praise of 
rivers’) in the Rigveda.
	1 That it was a tributary of the Indus 
is certain, but which one is unknown. 1) x. 75, 6. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 14; Ludwig, Translation of the 
Rigveda, 3, 200.

सुहविसाङ्गिरस
सु-हविस् आङ्गिरस
 (‘descendant of Aṅgiras’) is the name of 
the seer of a Sāman or chant in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa 
(xiv. 3, 25).

सूकर
सू-कर
 ‘wild-boar,’ has the appearance of being an onomato
poetic word (‘making the sound sū’); it is more probably a 
very old word going back to the Indo-European period, and 
cognate with the Latin su-culus (‘little pig’), being transformed 
in sense by popular etymology.
	1 It occurs in the Rigveda
	2 
and later.
	3 It appears once in the Atharvaveda accompanied 
by mṛga,
	4 the combined words apparently meaning ‘wild hog,’ 
as opposed to Varāha, ‘boar.’ 1) The sū- corresponding to Lat. sū-s, 
Gk. -s, Old High German, sū. Cf. 
Brugmann, Grundriss, 2^2, 483. 2) vii. 55, 4. 3) Av. ii. 27, 2; v. 14, 1; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 21; Vājasaneyi Saṃ
hitā, xxiv. 40; Chāndogya Upaniṣad, 
v. 10, 2, etc. None of the passages 
refer to the flesh as eaten: Buddha's 
death was due to a meal of sūkara- 
maddava, which may well mean ‘tender 
parts of pork’ (see Fleet, Journal of the 
Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, 881, n.), 
though the Rājanighaṇṭu, vii. 85, gives 
sūkara as meaning the Batatas edulis. 4) xii. 1, 48. The use of mṛga here 
does not indicate that sūkara is a new 
name, because the latter word elsewhere 
always occurs alone both in the Rigveda 
and later (n. 3). Cf. Mṛga above, 2, 
172, n. 3. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 82; 
Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 100.

सूक्त
सूक्त,
 ‘well uttered,’ is the regular term for a ‘hymn’ as 
part of the Śastra in the later Saṃhitās
	1 and the Brāhmaṇas.
	2 
The sense of ‘hymn’ must also be recognized in several 
passages of the Rigveda.
	3 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 4, 5, 5; 
vii. 1, 5, 4, etc. 2) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 33; iii. 11, 
9. 12-15; iv. 21, 5; vi. 8, 10; Kauṣītaki

Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 5, 1, 18; Nirukta, 
iv. 6; xi. 16. 3) i. 42, 20; 171, 1; ii. 6, 2; vii. 29, 3, 
etc.

सूची
सूची,
 ‘needle,’ is found in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) ii. 32, 4. 2) Av. xi. 10, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxiii. 33; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9,

Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa, i. 10, 3 (Oertel,

सूचीक
सूचीक
 is the name of a stinging insect in the Rigveda.
	1 1) i. 191, 7. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 98.

सूत
सूत
 is the name of a court official who is often mentioned 
with the Grāmaṇī. He is one of the eight Vīras in the Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
	1 and of the eleven Ratnins in other texts.
	2 
He also appears in the Atharvaveda
	3 among the kingmakers 
(Rājakṛt) and in the Śatrarudriya
	4 (‘section dealing with the 
hundred Rudras’) of the Yajurveda. The commentators are 
agreed in seeing in him the ‘charioteer’ (Sārathi) or ‘master of 
the horse,’ of the king; this sense is accepted by Roth,
	5 by 
Whitney,
	6 and by Bloomfield.
	7 But the fact that the Saṃ- 
grahītṛ, who occurs in several passages beside the Sūta, is the 
‘charioteer,’ renders this version improbable. Eggeling
	8 thinks 
that he was, in the Brāhmaṇas at least, a minstrel and court 
poet, while Weber
	9 considers that his name denotes him as 
‘consecrated’ — that is, one who has constant access to the 
king. In the Epic the Sūta serves as a royal herald and 
bard:
	10 it may be that the curious words ahanti,
	11 ahantya,
	12 or 
ahantva
	13 applied to him
	14 in the Śatarudriya denote his sacred 
character at once as minstrel and as herald — a combination of 
functions not unknown elsewhere. 1) ix. 1, 4, where he follows the 
chief queen (Mahiṣī), and precedes the 
Grāmaṇī in the list. 2) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xv. 4; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 5; iv. 3, 8; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 7, 3, 1; Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, i. 8, 9, 1; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,

Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xvi. 18. So also in the list of victims at 
the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’), 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 6; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 2, 1. For other refer

Oriental Society, 13, 254, 255. 11) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 18. This 
word means ‘non-fighter’ according 
to Weber, Indische Studien, 17, 200. 12) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 2, 1. 13) Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 2; Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3. 14) The last two forms appear to be 
equivalent in sense to ahanya, ‘not to 
be slain,’ ‘inviolable.’

सूतवशा
सूत-वशा
 denotes in the Yajurveda
	1 a cow barren after 
having one calf. 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 4; vi. 1, 3, 6; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvii. 5; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 7, 4, 1, etc.

सूत्र
सूत्र
 has the sense of ‘thread’ in the Atharvaveda
	1 and 
later.
	2 In the sense of a ‘book of rules’ for the guidance of 
sacrificers and so forth, the word occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad.

Cf. Weber, Indische Studien, 5, 24, 25; 
Sieg, Die Sagenstoffe des Ṛgveda, 21.

सूद
सूद,
 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, means 
‘well’
	1 and the ‘mud of a dried-up pool.’
	2 Pischel,
	3 however, 
shows clearly that Sūda denotes what is added to Soma to 
make it fit for use, especially the warm milk, and this sense suits 
all the passages. Eggeling
	4 renders it ‘well,’ and Grassmann 
‘sweet drink.’ 1) Rv. vii. 36, 3; ix. 97, 4. 2) Rv. x. 61, 2; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,

सूददोहस्
सूद-दोहस्
 in the Rigveda
	1 denotes ‘milking Sūda’ — i.e., 
what is requisite to mix with Soma, according to Pischel.
	2 
According to Roth,
	3 it means ‘yielding milk like a well.’ 1) viii. 69, 3. 2) Vedische Studien, 1, 72. Sūdayitnu 
in Rv. x. 64, 9, may be taken in the 
same way, and sūdin in Kāṭhaka Saṃ
hitā, xxvii. 2; sūdya in Taittirīya Saṃ
hitā, vii. 4, 13, 1; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xxii. 25, etc. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

सूना
सूना
 means, in the Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda,
	2 
apparently a ‘woven (from sīv, ‘sew’) wickerwork basket’ for 
holding flesh. 1) i. 161, 10; 162, 13; x. 86, 18. 2) Av. v. 17, 14. Crates of Palāśa 
wood are mentioned in the Śāṅkhāyana 
Śrauta Sūtra, xvii. 3, 2. 3. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 271.

सूनु
सूनु
 is a common word for ‘son’ from the Rigveda 
onwards.
	1 The etymological sense seems to be ‘he who is 
borne,’ and then ‘the begotten.’
	2 But the use of Sūnu in the 
Rigveda
	3 is predominantly in relation to the father, and only 
rarely in its connexion with words for mother.
	4 Thus a father 
is ‘easy of access’ (sāpāyana) to his son (sūnu);
	5 but in another 
passage,
	6 where the same term is applied to earth as a mother, 
the word used for son is Putra. No conclusion as to matriarchy 
can of course be drawn from the etymology. On the relation 
of son and father, see Pitṛ. 1) Rv. i. 26, 3; ii. 38, 5; vi. 52, 9, 
etc.; Av. vi. 1, 2; vii. 2, 2; xii. 3, 23, 
etc. 2) Delbrück, Die indogermanischen Ver- 
wandischaftsnamen, 453. 3) Usually in a figurative sense — e.g 
sahasaḥ, adreḥ Sūruḥ. 4) v. 42, 2. 5) Rv. i. 1, 9. 6) Rv. x. 18, 11.

सूरि
सूरि
 is the regular word in the Rigveda
	1 for the sacrificer, the 
later Yajamāna — that is, the man who pays the priests for 
performing the rite, and reaps the benefit of that service. The 
Sūris are often coupled with the Maghavans,
	1 described as 
heroes or warriors,
	2 and as related to the priests by their 
patronage
	3 or as companions.

ix. 96, 4; x. 115, 7. 
Cf. Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 236.

सूर्मि
सूर्मि
 denotes in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 according to the 
St. Petersburg Dictionary, a kind of ‘tube’ serving as a lamp. 
In one passage of the Rigveda
	3 it means a ‘pipe’ for conveying 
water. Cf. Avata. 1) vii. 1, 3. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, i. 5, 7, 6; 
v. 4, 7, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxi. 9, 
where it is described as karṇakāvatī, 
rendered by Roth as ‘provided with 
a handle.’ 3) viii. 69, 12. Sūrmya in Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 9, 2, may mean ‘being 
in pipes or channels.’

सूर्य
सूर्य,
 the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and 
religion,
	1 corresponding with the importance of the sun as a 
factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda
	2 
the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not 
unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued 
from the cold regions of the Himālaya mountains. Its heat 
is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda,
	3 as 
well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the 
Brāhmaṇas.
	4 
In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished Sūrya and to 
have stolen his wheel:
	5 this is possibly a reference to the 
obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm.
	6 The Aitareya 
Brāhmaṇa
	7 presents a naive conception of the course of the 
sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as 
returning from west to east by the same road, but with the 
reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining 
the stars in heaven.
	8 In the Rigveda
	9 wonder is expressed 
that the sun does not fall. 
There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In 
one passage
	10 Svarbhānu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the 
sun with darkness, while Atri restores the light of the sun, a 
similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris.
	11 
In the Atharvaveda
	12 Rāhu appears for the first time in con
nexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of Sūrya
	6 may also be 
explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages
	13 
such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig
	14 not 
only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses 
caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards 
the sun as going round the earth,
	15 but even endeavours to 
identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that 
occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by 
Whitney.
	16 
The sun as a maker of time
	17 determines the year of 360 days, 
which is the civil year and the usual year (Saṃvatsara) of 
Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves — 
the Uttarāyaṇa,
	18 when the sun goes north, and the Dakṣiṇā
yana,
	19 when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these 
periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the 
winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer 
solstice, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa
	20 says so in perfectly clear 
language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as 
those when the sun is in the north — i.e., when it is north of the 
equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of depar
ture the equinoxes, not the solstices; but this view has no 
support in Vedic literature, and is opposed to the fact that 
the equinoxes play no part in Vedic astronomical theory.
	21 
There are only doubtful references to the solstices in the 
Rigveda.
	22 
The Brāhmaṇas,
	23 and perhaps the Rigveda,
	24 regard the 
moon as entering the sun at new moon. According to Hille
brandt,
	25 the Rigveda
	26 recognizes that the moon shines 
by the borrowed light of the sun, but this seems very doubt 
ful. See also Aryamṇaḥ Panthā,
	27 Nakṣatra, and Sapta

refers to an eclipse. See Lanman,

In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 3, 
the two Ayanas are equated each with 
three seasons — the northern course with 
spring, summer, and rains; the southern 
with autumn, winter, and cool season. 
But this is merely an inevitable in
accuracy, since no real season begins 
with the winter solstice. 20) xix. 3. Cf. Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

none of these passages are conclusive.

i. 190, 3; Sāmaveda, ii. 9, 2, 12, 1. 
Thibaut, op. cit., 6, considers that the 
meaning of the passages is merely that 
the moon is filled up during the bright 
half of the month by light emanating 
from the sun. 27) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 188, finds in the Rigveda, 
i. 110, 2, a mention of the inclination 
of the ecliptic to the equator, and in 
x. 86, 4, a reference to the axis of the 
earth. Cf. Tilak, Orion, 158 et seq.; 
Oldenberg, Ṛgveda-Noten, 1, 102, 105. 
These views are clearly quite wrong. 
The notions of the sun given in the 
Brāhmaṇas are all very naive and 
simple; the distance of heaven and 
the sun from the earth is the height 
of a thousand cows one on the top 
of the other (Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, 
xvi. 8, 6), or forty-four days' journey 
for a horse (ibid., xxv. 10, 16), or a 
thousand days' journey for a horse 
(Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17, 8), or a 
hundred leagues (Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa, 
viii. 3). They record also such facts 
as that the sun rises from and sets in 
the waters (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 20, 
13; of. Nirukta, vi. 17; Kauṣītaki 
Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 4, 5; xxvi. 1), and 
that it sets in the west (ibid., xviii. 9). 
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa calls the sun 
circular (vii. 4, 1, 17), and also four
cornered (catuḥ-śrakti) in xiv. 3, 1, 17, 
and so on. See Weber, Indische Studien, 
9, 358 et seq.

सूर्यनक्षत्र
सूर्य-नक्षत्र
 is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	1 in a 
passage where Sāyaṇa takes it as denoting a Nakṣatra, which 
gives out rays of light like the sun. But the real sense (as the 
Kāṇva text helps to show) is that the sacrificer may take the 
sun for his Nakṣatra — i.e., he may neglect the Nakṣatras 
altogether and rely on the sun. 1) ii. 1, 2, 19. Cf. Eggeling, Sacred Books of the East, 12, 288.

सूर्यचन्द्रमसा
सूर्य-चन्द्रमसा
 or Sūrya-candramasau denotes ‘sun and 
moon’ as a pair of luminaries in the Rigveda
	1 and later.

सृक
सृक
 in a couple of passages of the Rigveda
	1 denotes a 
weapon of Indra, perhaps a ‘lance.’ 1) i. 32, 12; x. 180, 2. Cf. sṛkāyin, 
sṛkā-hasta, ‘bearing a lance in his 
hand,’ in the Śatarudriya, Vājasaneya 
Saṃhitā, xvi. 21, 61, etc.

सृगाल
सृगाल
 , ‘jackal,’ is not found until the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 
xii. 5, 2, 5), but is common in the Epic.

सृजय
सृजय
 is the name of one of the victims at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.
	1 What it was is unknown: 
Mahīdhara on the Vājasaneyi passage calls it a kind of bird; 
Sāyaṇa on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā gives the alternatives ‘black 
fly’ (when sṛjayā must be read), ‘white serpent,’ and ‘black 
buffalo.’ 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 14, 1; 
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 14; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 23. Cf. Zimmer, 
Altindisches Leben, 99.

सृञ्जय
सृञ्जय
 is the name of a people mentioned as early as the 
Rigveda. Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) Daivavāta 
is celebrated as victorious over the Turvaśas and the Vṛcī- 
vants,
	1 and his sacrificial fire is referred to.
	2 In connexion 
with Daivavāta is also mentioned Sāhadevya Somaka,
	3 no 
doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	4 we find 
Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally Suplan) 
Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by Parvata and 
Nārada. The Rigveda
	5 has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’) 
of Prastoka,
	6 a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with Divodāsa. 
Moreover, Vītahavya
	7 seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though 
Zimmer
	8 prefers to take the derivative word, Vaitahavya, not 
as a patronymic, but as an epithet. 
It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the Tṛtsus were 
closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated 
together,
	9 and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.
	10 This view 
is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	11 which recognizes 
Devabhāga Śrautarṣa as Purohita of the Kurus and the 
Sṛñjayas. 
On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas, 
at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda
	12 
to have offended the Bhṛgus and to have ended miserably. 
There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but 
both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	13 and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,
	14 in 
independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained 
some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled 
with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate 
of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their dis
obedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this 
allusion. 
The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain. 
Hillebrandt
	15 suggests that in early times they must be looked 
for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though 
he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that 
the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the 
	16 of the 
Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer
	17 is inclined 
to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide 
definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well 
have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their 
allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the Madhyadeśa, and were certainly 
absorbed in the Kurus. 
Of the history of this clan we have one notice.
	18 They 
expelled Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana, one of their kings, from the 
hereditary monarchy — of ten generations — and also drove out 
Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati, probably his minister, 
who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the 
king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, Balhika 
Prātīpya. Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at 
the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the 
king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can 
hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,
	19 as a 
defeat of the Sṛñjayas. 1) Rv. vi. 27, 7. 2) Rv. iv. 15, 4. 3) Rv. iv. 15, 7. 4) vii. 34, 9. 5) Rv. vi. 47, 22. 25. 6) Cf. Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sutra,

and their connexion with the Sṛñjayas 
(Vītahavya in Rv. vi. 15, 2. 3, and see 
vi. 27, 7, both passages that can safely 
be accepted as derived from the Bharad
vāja family). 10) See, on the one hand, Rv. vii. 18

सृणी
सृणी̆
 is found certainly in one,
	1 and probably also in two 
other
	2 passages of the Rigveda. The sense appears to be 
‘sickle.’ In one other passage Sṛṇya is coupled with jetā:
	3 the 
sense is doubtful, Roth
	4 conjecturing cetā, and Oldenberg
	5 
pointing out that chettā is also possible. Hopkins
	6 thinks that 
a ‘hook’ is here meant. 1) i. 58, 4, where sṛṇyā, according to 
Geldner, Vedische Studien, 1, 116, n. 1, 
and to Pischel, ibid., 2, 111, stands for 
sṛṇyābhiḥ, and, as an adjective agreeing 
with juhūbhiḥ, means ‘sickle-shaped 
sacrificial ladles.’ But this is very 
doubtful. 2) x. 101, 3 (Nirukta, v. 28); 106, 6

 is the name of an unknown animal at the Aśvamedha 
(‘horse sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhita, v. 5, 16, 1 
(according to Sāyaṇa = camara); Maitrā
yaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 20; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xxiv. 39 (where Mahīdhara 
identifies it with the Gavaya).

सेतु
सेतु
 appears in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 to denote merely a 
raised bank for crossing inundated land,
	3 a ‘causeway,’ such as 
are common all the world over. This sense explains best the 
later meaning of ‘boundary.’ The word in Vedic literature 
is probably always metaphorical. 1) ix. 41, 2. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iii. 2, 2, 1; 
vi. 1, 4, 9; 5, 3, 3; vii. 5, 8, 5;

1. 2, etc. 3) Max Müller, Sacred Books of the 
East, 1, 130, n. 2.

सेना
सेना
 denotes primarily a ‘missile,’ a sense found in the 
Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda,
	2 and then a ‘host’ or ‘army,’ 
which is its normal meaning.
	3 See Saṃgrāma. 1) Rv. i. 66, 7; 116, 1 (senā-jū, ‘swift 
as an arrow’); 143, 5; 186, 9; ii. 33, 
11; v. 30, 9; vii. 3, 4; viii. 75, 7; 
x. 23, 1. 2) viii. 8, 7; xi. 10, 4. 3) Rv. i. 33, 6; vii. 25, 1; ix. 96, 1;

Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 
46, 456; Bloomfield, ibid., 48, 549, 550;

denies that Senā ever means ‘mis
sile,’ and compares exercitus effusus, 
agmen effusum.

सेनानी
सेना-नी,
 ‘leader of an army,’ is the title of the royal 
‘general.’ He is mentioned in the Rigveda,
	1 where also
	2 the 
word is used metaphorically. He is also referred to in the 
Śatarudriya,
	3 as well as elsewhere in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās and 
Brāhmaṇas.
	4 He is one of the Ratnins of the king.
	5 Presum
ably he was appointed by the king, not by the people, to 
command in war when the king became too important to lead 
every little fray in person. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	6 this 
official is called Senā-pati. 1) vii. 20, 5; ix. 96, 1; x. 84, 2. 2) x. 34, 12 (the gambling hymn). 3) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xvi. 17;

सेलग
सेलग
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 appears to denote ‘robber.’ See 
Sailaga. 1) Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 1, 5; viii. 11, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xiii. 4, 3, 10.

सेहु
सेहु
 occurs in a comparison in the Atharvaveda,
	1 where it 
must denote a very sapless (arasa) substance. 1) vii. 76, 1. Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 54; Whitney, Translation of the 
Atharvaveda, 441.

सैतव
सैतव,
 ‘descendant of Setu,’ is the name of a teacher in the 
first two Vaṃśas (list of teachers) in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka 
Upaniṣad.
	1 He is described as a pupil of Pārāśarya or of 
Pārāśaryāyaṇa.

सैन्धव,
 ‘coming from the Indus,’ is a term applied to 
water in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,

	2 to a horse in the Śatapatha, Brāhmaṇa,
	3 and to salt in 
the same text.

सैलग
सैलग
 is found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
	1 and the 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	2 as the name of one of the victims at the 
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). ‘Robber’ seems to be 
the sense of this word, as of Selaga. 1) xxx. 18. 2) iii. 4, 16, 1; Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,

सोम
सोम
 was the famous plant which was used for the prepara
tion of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its 
importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of 
the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other 
Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise. 
Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs 
or shoots are described as brown (babhru),
	1 ruddy (aruṇa),
	2 of 
tawny (hari).
	3 Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet 
Naicāśākha
	4 refers to the plant as Hillebrandt
	5 thinks. The 
shoot is called aṃśu,
	6 while the plant as a whole is called 
andhas,
	7 which also denotes the juice.
	8 Parvan
	9 is the stem. 
Kṣip,
	10 ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may 
therefore have resembled fingers in shape; vakṣaṇā
	11 and vāṇa
	12 
also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight. 
evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular.
	13 
The plant grew on the mountains,
	14 that of Müjavant being 
specially renowned. 
These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has 
been held
	15 to be the Sarcostemma viminale or the Asclepias acida 
(= Sarcostemma brevistigma). Roth
	16 held that the Sarcostemma 
acidum more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt
	17 
suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice
	18 
thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and 
Rājendralāla Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an 
ingredient in a kind of beer — i.e., that the Soma plant was a 
species of hop. Hillebrandt
	19 considers that neither hops nor 
the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very 
probable that the plant cannot now be identified.
	20 
In the Yajurveda
	21 the plant is purchased ere it is pressed. 
Hillebrandt
	22 considers that the sale must be assumed for the 
Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained 
by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince 
owned it, like the Kīkaṭas.
	23 As it stands, the ritual perform
ance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas 
(represented by a Śūdra), a ritual imitation of the action which 
may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing 
to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great 
distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Brāhmaṇa 
period.
	24 
The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones 
or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of pro
cedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones 
are called grāvan
	25 or adri,
	26 and were, of course, held in the 
hands.
	27 The plant was laid on boards one beside the other 
(Adhiṣavana), and, according at least to the later ritual,
	28 a 
hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by 
means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a 
prophylactic against demoniac influences. 
The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi
	29 — which 
was no longer done in the later ritual — Dhiṣaṇā in some 
passages denoting the Vedi.
	30 
Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the 
stones.
	31 This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common 
in Vedic times. 1) The word is not actually found 
applied to the plant itself; but the 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, ix. 5, 3, pre
scribes arjunāni, plants of this indefinite 
colour, as a substitute for Soma, if 
Pūtīkas cannot be obtained. 2) Rv. vii. 98, 1; x. 94, 3; 144, 5. 
Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 10, 
1 et seq. 3) Rv. ix. 92, 1. The Soma cow, 
with which Soma was purchased, is 
called babhru or aruṇā, Śatapatha Brāh

iii. 7, 5, etc. 4) Rv. iii. 53, 14. Cf. Naicāśākha. 5) Vedische Mythologie, 1, 14-18; 2,

Pischel, Vedische Studien, 1, 70. 11) Rv. viii. 1, 17. 12) Rv. iv. 24, 9; ix. 50, 1. But these 
passages are both very doubtful. Cf. 
Vāṇa. The husk left after the press
ing is called andhas (ix. 86, 44; vavri 
(ix. 69, 9), tvac (ix. 86, 44; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 13, 1), śarīva (ibid., 2),

Max Müller, Roth, J. G. Baker, W. T. 
Thiselton Dyer, Charles G. Leland, 
and A. Houtum-Schindler, as to the 
identity of the plant, is reprinted in 
Max Müller's Biographies of Words, 222 
et seq., and reviewed by Hillebrandt. 
See also Eggeling, Sacred Books of the 
East, 26, xxiv. et seq., who thinks that 
the traditional identification is not far 
wrong. Caland, Altindisches Zauberritual, 
188, gives it as Sarcostemma acidum. 20) The original Soma plant was, 
doubtless, identical with the Haoma of 
the Avesta. On the plant from which 
the present Parsis of Kermān and Yezd 
obtain their Hūm juice, and which they 
regard as identical with the Avestic 
Haoma, see Eggeling, Sacred Books of 
the East, 26, xxiv et seq. 21) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iii. 3, 1, 
1 et seq.; Hillebrandt, 1, 89 et seq. 22) Ibid., 70. 23) Rv. iii. 53, 14. 24) See Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5,

Adri is used oftener with the verb su, 
‘press,’ than grāvan, which is more 
personally conceived, and so appears 
with vad, ‘speak,’ and so forth; Hille
brandt, 1, 153, n. 1. 27) Rv. v. 45, 7; ix. 11, 5; x. 76, 2, 
etc. 28) Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, iv. 4, 
28; that ākhara, Rv. x. 94, 5, denotes 
this is uncertain. 29) Rv. v. 31, 12. 30) Rv. i. 109, 3; iii. 2, 1; vi. 11, 3, 
etc. 31) Rv. i. 28. The pestle is manthā, 
the mortar ulūkhala; in x. 101, 11, 
vanaspati and vana may have the same 
senses respectively.

चमू
चमू
 denotes the vessel used for the offering to the god,
	32 
Kalaśa and Camasa those used for the priests to drink from. 
Sometimes
	33 the Camū denotes the mortar and pestle. Perhaps 
the vessel was so called because of its mortar-like shape. 
The skin on which the shoots were placed was called 
Tvac,
	34 or twice go (‘cow-hide’).
	35 Kośa,
	36 Sadhastha,
	37 Dru,
	38 
Vana,
	39 Droṇa,
	40 are all terms used for Soma vessels, while 
Sruva
	41 denotes the ‘ladle.’ 
Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to 
increase its yield of juice.
	42 
It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process 
of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was 
certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve
	43 (Pavitra). 
The Soma was then used unmixed (śukra,
	44 śuci)
	45 for Indra and 
Vāyu, but the Kaṇvas seem to have dropped this usage.
	46 The 
juice is described as brown (babhru),
	47 tawny (hari),
	48 or ruddy 
(aruṇa),
	49 and as having a fragrant smell,
	50 at least as a 
rule.
	51 
Soma was mixed with milk (Gavāśir),
	52 curd or sour milk 
(Dadhyāśir),
	53 or grain (Yavāśir).
	54 The admixtures are 
alluded to with various figurative expressions, as Atka, 
‘armour’;
	55 Vastra
	56 or Vāsas,
	57 ‘garment’; Abhiśrī,
	58 ‘admix
ture’; rūpa,
	59 ‘beauty’; śrī,
	60 ‘splendour’; rasa,
	61 ‘flavour’; 
prayas,
	62 ‘dainty’; and perhaps nabhas,
	63 ‘fragrance.’ The 
adjective tīvra
	64 denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when 
so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed 
out, are denoted by ṛjīṣa, ‘residue.’
	65 
It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with 
Soma: perhaps the kośa madhu-ścut, ‘the pail distilling sweet
ness,’ was used for the mixing.
	66 It seems doubtful if Surā was 
ever so mixed.
	67 
There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the 
two of the Avesta.
	68 The evening pressing was specially 
connected with the Ṛbhus, the midday with Indra, the 
morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods 
also had their share.
	69 The drinker of Soma and the non
drinker are sharply discriminated in the texts.
	70 Localities 
where Soma was consumed were Ārjīka, Pastyāvant, Śarya- 
ṇāvant, Suṣomā, the territory of the Pañcajanāḥ or ‘five 
peoples,’ and so on.
	71 The effects of Soma in exhilarating and 
exciting the drinkers are often alluded to.
	72 
It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed 
to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is 
very slight,
	73 and not decisive. 32) Not the pressing boards, which 
are unknown in the Rigveda. Cf. Rv. 
ix. 99, 8; x. 91, 15, etc. 33) Rv. i. 28, 9; iv. 18, 3; vi. 57, 2, 
etc.; Hillebrandt, 1, 170, 173. 34) Rv. ix. 65, 25; 66, 29; 70, 7; 
79, 4, etc. 35) Rv. x. 94, 9; 116, 4. 36) Rv. vii. 101, 4; viii. 20, 8, etc. 
It denotes the larger vessel from which 
the Soma is poured into the Kalaśas, 
or cups. 37) Rv. iii. 62, 15; ix. 1, 2; 17, 8, etc. 38) Rv. ix. 1, 2; 65, 6; 98, 2; in 
x. 101, 10, dru = mortar. 39) Rv. ii. 14, 9; ix. 66, 9, etc. The 
word can mean both the vessel into 
which the Soma was poured after pre
paration, and the vessel from which it 
was offered to the gods. 40) Rv. ix. 15, 7; 33, 2, etc. The 
word, having no definite sense, can 
denote any of the vessels. The camū, 
on the other hand, was the cup for the 
gods, the kalaśa that for the priests 
(later it was also used as = kośa, when 
camasa had replaced kalaśa as cup for 
the priests; Hillebrandt, 1, 187). 41) Rv. i. 116, 24. Cf. also Amatra 
and Khārī. 42) This process is technically called 
āpyāyana, ‘causing to swell.’ Cf. Rv. 
ix. 74, 9; Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 5. 
The exact nature and extent of this 
process is quite uncertain; Hillebrandt, 
193-195; Eggeling, Sacred Books of 
the East, 26, xxvi. 43) Whether the later practice of 
purification by means of shoots held 
in the hands was known to the Rigveda 
is uncertain, since ii. 14, 8; ix. 71, 3, 
are quite indecisive. For the various 
terms used to designate the sieve, see 
Pavitra. 44) Rv. i. 137, 1; iii. 32, 2; viii. 2, 
10, etc. 45) Rv. i. 5, 5; 30, 2; viii. 2, 9, 
etc. 46) Cf. Rv. viii. 2, 5. 9. 10, 28, etc. 
The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iv. 7, 4, dis
approves of the unmixed Soma. Pos
sibly Hillebrandt, 1, 207, 208, may be 
right in thinking that the Kāṇvas had 
to lay special stress on the use of the 
mixtures, because they used a plant 
which was deficient in the true Soma 
character. 47) Rv. ix. 33, 2; 63, 4. 6. 48) Rv. ix. 3, 9; 7, 6; 65, 8. 12. 25, 
etc. 49) Rv. ix. 40, 2; 45, 3; aruṣa, ix. 61, 
21; śoṇa, ix. 97, 13. 50) ix. 97, 19; 107, 2. 51) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 3, 6. 
This passage has been relied on by 
Eggeling, op. cit., 26, xxv, as a con
firmation of the later description, in 
a medical work, of the plant as ill
smelling. But this plant may have 
been a different one from that used in 
Vedic times. The smell may have 
been due to a substitute being used, or 
to the genuine plant, brought from a 
distance, being old and withered. 52) Hillebrandt, 1, 219-222. 53) Ibid., 221. 54) Ibid., 222 et seq. 55) Rv. ix. 69, 4. 56) ix. 8, 6. 57) ix. 69, 5. 58) ix. 79, 5; 86, 27. 59) Av. ix. 25, 4. 60) Rv. iv. 41, 8; ix. 16, 6. 61) Rv. iii. 48, 1; vi. 47, 1; ix. 97,

Ṛjīṣa as an adjective occurs in Rv. 
i. 32, 6, and ṛjīṣin in the Rigveda means, 
according to Hillebrandt, 1, 236, 237,

shoots belong.’ Soma tiroahnya is ‘Soma 
pressed the day before yesterday.’ 66) Rv. ix. 103, 3. Cf. ix. 17, 8;

Śāryāta, i. 51, 12; iii. 51, 7; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, vii. 35; Śīṣṭas, viii. 53, 4, 
etc.; Turvaśa Yadu, viii. 45, 27; 
Saṃvarta Kṛśa, viii. 54, 2; Nīpātithi, 
Medhyātithi, Puṣṭigu, Śruṣṭigu, viii. 51, 
1, etc. The ritual lays stress on the 
need of continuity in Soma-drinking in 
a family: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 5, 
5 et seq.; Maitrāvaṇī Saṃhitā, ii. 5, 5, 
etc. 71) See s.v.; Hillebrandt, 1, 125-143. 
It is possible that Soma may have 
grown on the mountains to the north 
of Madhyadeśa, whatever may have 
been its original home, on which cf. 
Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- 
ländischen Gesellschaft, 38, 134 et seq. 72) See Rv. viii. 48. It was equally 
prized in Avestic times. It is, however, 
seldom spoken of as giving the priests 
pleasure: Rv. i. 91, 13; viii. 2, 12; 
x. 167, 3. There are many references 
to sickness caused by it (Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 13 etc.). The Sautrā
maṇī was a rite designed to expiate the ill 
caused by vomiting Soma as Indra had 
done: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 2, 5, 6; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9; xii. 7, 
1, 11. The name of the rite is already 
found in Av. vii. 3, 2, and the rite 
itself is no doubt older (see also Viṣū- 
cikā). This fact tells in favour of the 
traditional identification of the plant, 
for the medical passage quoted by 
Max Müller refers to its producing 
vomiting. See also Zimmer, Altindisches 
Leben, 275; Rv. i. 91, 13; 118, 3; 
viii. 2, 12; 17, 6; 48, 12. Perhaps 
Vamra in i. 112, 15, got his name 
thence. 73) Rv. viii. 69, 8-10. Cf. viii. 31, 5; 
i. 28, 5; Hillebrandt, 1, 143-147. The 
evidence is not decisive; the ordinary 
Soma sacrifice was clearly a sacrifice 
of rich patrons.

that Vasiṣṭha, his son being slain, desired to avenge himself on 
the Saudāsas, and eventually succeeded. Geldner
	3 sees a 
reference to the story in the Rigveda,
	4 but without cause. 1) ii. 390 (Journal of the American 
Oriental Society, 18, 47). The story must 
have appeared in the Śāṭyāyanaka also.

litteratur, 101.

स्त्री
स्त्री
 is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’ 
without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. Nārī 
has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while Gnā 
refers only to the wives of the gods, and Yoṣit, with its cognate 
words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage.
	1 In the 
Rigveda
	2 Strī stands opposed to Pumāṃs, ‘man,’ and once to 
vṛṣan, ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda
	3 does it mean 
‘wife’ as opposed to Pati, ‘husband,’ and even in the Sūtras it 
is sharply opposed to Jāyā. 
In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was 
taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and 
Mātṛ). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion 
of women, which was practically complete in all but the 
earliest Epic:
	4 the maiden may be assumed to have grown up 
in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth 
of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Educa
tion
	5 was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for 
we hear in the Upaniṣads of women who could take no 
unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics. 
Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were 
unmanly accomplishments.
	6 
Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few 
and meagre. The Rigveda,
	7 however, shows that in the place 
of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brother
less maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors 
were believed to await the man who took advantage of their 
defencelessness.
	8 Moreover, women could not take an inherit
ance,
	9 and were not independent persons in the eyes of the 
law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage 
they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their 
husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing 
them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the 
necessity of maintaining the wife.
	10 Their earnings would be 
appropriated by their nearest relative — usually father or brother 
-in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn 
anything, as in the case of courtezans. 1) Cf. Delbrück, Die indogermanischen 
Verwandtsehaftsnamen, 417. 2) Rv. i. 164, 16; v. 61, 8, etc. So 
also often later — e.g., Maitrāyaṇī Saṃ
hitā, iv. 7, 4; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 5, 
8, 2. 3) xii. 2, 39. Cf. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,

स्थपति
स्थ-पति
 is the name of a royal official mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda,
	1 and often later.
	2 Revottaras Cākra was the 
Sthapati of the exiled Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana, a king of the 
Sṛñjayas, and succeeded in restoring him to his royal dignity.
	3 
The exact sense of the term is not certain: ‘governor’
	4 is 
possible, but perhaps ‘chief judge’
	5 is more likely; as in the 
case of the early English judges, his functions may have been 
both executive and judicial. He is inferior in position to the 
king's brother.
	6 1) ii. 32, 4; v. 23, 11 (of the chief of 
the worms in both cases). 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 5, 2, 2; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xvii. 12; Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, ii. 9, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, 
xvi. 19; Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xvii. 11, 
6. 7; xxiv. 18, 2; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
v. 4, 4, 17, etc. 3) Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, xii. 8, 1, 17; 
9, 3, 1 et seq. Sthapati here is part, as 
it were, of the name of the man. 4) In the Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra, 
i. 1, 12; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, ix. 
14, 12, is found Niṣāda-sthapati; 
perhaps ‘governor of Niṣādas.’ But 
it may also mean (cf. Weber, Indische 
Studien, 1, 207, n.) a Niṣāda as a 
Sthapati; thus, little can be deduced 
from this passage in particular. Eggel
ing, Sacred Books of the East, 41, 111, 
renders it ‘governor.’ Cf. also St. 
Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., and Aupo- 
diti. 5) Weber, Indische Studien, 10, 13,

स्थविर
स्थविर,
 literally ‘elder,’ is used as a sort of epithet of 
several men; Sthavira Śākalya occurs in the Aitareya Āraṇ
yaka
	1 and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka,
	2 and Sthavira Jātūkarṇya

 in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
	1 is applied to an 
ornament (alaṃkāra) meaning ‘made of the fragrant substance 
Sthagara,’ which elsewhere
	2 appears as Sthakara. 1) ii. 3, 10, 2; Apastamba Śrauta

1. Snāvanya, used in the plural, denotes particular parts of 
the body of a horse in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (v. 7, 23, 1).

स्नावन्य

स्नुषा
स्नुषा
 denotes the ‘daughter-in-law’ in relation primarily to 
her father-in-law, but also to her mother-in-law. In the latter 
sense the word appears in the Rigveda
	1 in the epithet su-snuṣā, 
‘having a good daughter-in-law,’ used of Vṛṣākapāyī, while in 
the former it occurs in several passages, where the daughter
in-law's respect for her father-in-law is mentioned,
	2 a respect 
which spirituous liquor alone causes to be violated.

	2 
takes the word as perhaps the name of an enemy of Kutsa. 
Cf. Ibha. 1) x. 49, 4. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

स्यन्दन,
 ‘chariot,’ is found in the earlier literature only, 
if at all, in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where Spandana is 
the received reading. 1) iii. 53, 19, according to Roth. A wood called Syandana seems to be 
meant in the Kauśika Sūtra, viii. 15.

स्याल
स्याल,
 a word occurring in only one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 
appears to denote the brother of a man's wife, who is regarded

स्यूम-गभस्ति
 See Gabhasti.

स्यूमगृभ्
स्यूम-गृभ्,
 used of a horse in the Rigveda (vi. 36, 2)

	1 denotes, according to 
Roth,
	2 the strap fastening the door of a house, the Homeric . 1) iii. 61, 4. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

स्रज्
स्रज्,
 ‘garland,’ is mentioned in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 as 
often worn by men when anxious to appear handsome, as at a 
wedding and so on. The Aśvins are described as ‘lotus
wreathed’ (puṣkara-sraj).
	3 1) iv. 38, 6; v. 53, 4; viii. 47, 15; 
56, 3. 2) Av. i. 14, 1 (where it means a

स्राक्त्य
स्राक्त्य
 is an adjective describing an amulet (Maṇi) in the 
Atharvaveda.
	1 According to Weber,
	2 it designates a crystal 
(literally ‘many-cornered’). The commentators,
	3 however, 
agree in explaining the word to mean ‘derived from the 
Sraktya’ — i.e., from the Tilaka tree (Clerodendrum phlomoides). 1) viii. 5, 4. 7. 8. Cf. ii. 11. 2) Indische Studien, 13, 164. 3) See Bloomfield, American Journal of 
Philology, 7, 477; Hymns of the Athar 
vaveda, 577.

स्रुच्
स्रुच्
 denotes a ‘large wooden sacrificial ladle’ (used for 
pouring clarified butter on the fire) in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
It is of the length of an arm, with a bowl of the size of a hand 
and a beaklike spout. 1) i. 84, 18; 110, 6; 144, 1, etc. 2) Av. v. 27, 5; vi. 114, 3; ix. 6, 
17, etc.

स्रुव
स्रुव,
 as opposed to Sruc, denotes in the ritual literature
	1 a 
small ladle used to convey the offering (Ājya) from the cooking
pot (Sthālī) to the large ladle (Juhū). In the Rigveda,
	2 how
ever, it was clearly used for the actual Soma libation. 1) Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra, i. 11, 
10, etc. 2) i. 116, 24; 121, 6, etc.

स्रेकपर्ण
स्रेक-पर्ण
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 seems to mean ‘like the 
oleander leaf.’ 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 6, 6, 3; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 6, 15.

स्वज
स्वज
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes the ‘viper.’ 
The word is explained by the commentators as sva-ja, ‘self 
born,’ but Roth,
	3 Weber,
	4 and Zimmer
	5 prefer to derive it 
from the root svaj, ‘clasp,’ ‘encircle.’ In the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā
	6 the Hariṇa is said to kill the viper. 1) iii. 27, 4; v. 14, 10; vi. 56, 2; 
x. 4, 10, 15, 17; xii. 3, 58. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 5, 10, 2; 
14, 1; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 26, 3. 3) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v., 
gives the alternative vivipara. 4) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, 2, 89, n. 5) Altindisches Leben, 95. 6) iii. 9, 3.

स्वधिति
1. Svadhiti in the Rigveda
	1 denotes the ‘axe’ or ‘knife’ 
used for dissecting the sacrificial horse. In all the other 
passages in that Saṃhitā
	2 the sense of ‘axe’ for cutting wood 
is adequate; reference is made in one place
	3 to sharpening the 
axe on the whetstone (kṣṇotra). In the Atharvaveda
	4 the term 
seems once to denote the copper (lohita)
	5 knife used to mark 
the ears of cattle; the carpenter's knife or axe is also twice 
referred to there.
	6 Later the word means ‘axe’ generally.
	7 
As a weapon it does not appear at all.
	8 1) i. 162, 9. 18. 20. 2) ii. 39, 7; iii. 2, 10; 8, 6, 11;

Atharvaveda, 386, 387; Geldner, Vedische 
Studien, 2, 159, who is inclined to com
pare Paraśu in Rv. iii. 53, 22. 5) Geldner, loc. cit., understands this 
word to mean ‘red-hot.’ 6) ix. 4, 6 (probably so to be taken); 
xii. 3, 33. In xviii. 2, 35, the sense is 
quite different. See Whitney, op. cit., 
845. 7) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vi. 3, 3, 2; Vāja
saneyi Saṃhitā, ii. 15 (the slaughtering
knife); v. 43 (the axe to fell the tree) 
etc. 8) In Rv. x. 92, 15, Svadhiti may 
refer to the thunderbolt of Indra.

स्वधिति
2. Svadhiti in certain passages of the Rigveda
	1 denotes, 
according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, a great tree with 
hard wood. This interpretation seems probable. 1) v. 32, 10; ix. 96, 6. Cf. i. 88, 2.

स्वनद्रथ
स्वनद्-रथ
 (‘having a rattling car’) is taken by Ludwig
	1 
as a proper name of Āsaṅga in the Rigveda.
	2 But the word is 
most probably only an epithet. 1) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 159. 2) viii. 1, 32.

स्वनयभाव्य
स्वनय भाव्य
 is the name of a prince on the Sindhu 
(Indus) who bestowed gifts on Kakṣīvant, according to the 
Rigveda (i. 126, 1. 3). He is called Svanaya Bhāvayavya in the 
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 11, 5).

स्वप्न
स्वप्न,
 ‘dream,’ is referred to in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 
Evil dreams
	3 are often mentioned. The Āraṇyakas of the 
Rigveda
	4 contain a list of dreams with their signification, as 
well as of pratyakṣa-darśanāni, ‘sights seen with one's own eyes.’ 1) ii. 28, 10; x. 162, 6. 2) Av. vii. 101, 1; x. 3, 6; Vājasaneyi 
Saṃhitā, xx. 16; Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa, iii. 2, 2, 23, etc. 3) Rv. ii. 28, 10; Av. x. 3, 6. 4) Aitareya Āraṇyaka, iii. 2, 4; Śāṅkh
āyana Āraṇyaka, xi. 3. Cf. Kauśika 
Sūtra, xlvi. 9 et seq.; Atharvaveda Pari
śiṣṭa, lxviii.

स्वर्
स्वर्
 denotes the ‘sun’
	1 and the ‘heaven of light’ in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) i. 71, 2; 105, 3; 148, 1, etc.; 
Nirukta, ii. 14. 1) i. 71, 2; 105, 3; 148, 1, etc.;

etc.; Av. iv. 11, 6; 14, 2, etc.

स्वर
स्वर
 denotes in the Upaniṣads
	1 the sound of a vowel: 
these are described
	2 as being ghoṣavant, ‘sonant,’ and also as 
balavant, ‘uttered with force.’ The precise word for a mute is 
sparśa,
	3 ‘contact,’ while ūṣman denotes a ‘sibilant,’ and svara a 
‘vowel,’ in the Aitareya
	3 and Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyakas.
	4 The 
semivowels are there denoted by anta-sthā (‘intermediate’)
	5 or 
akṣara.
	6 Another division in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	7 is into 
ghoṣa, ūṣman, and vyañjana, apparently ‘vowels,’ ‘sibilants,’ 
and ‘consonants’ respectively. Ghoṣa elsewhere in that Āraṇ
yaka
	8 seems to have the general sense of ‘sounds.’ The 
Taittirīya Upaniṣad
	9 refers to mātrā, a ‘mora’;
	10 bala, ‘force’ 
of utterance, and varṇa, ‘letter,’ an expression found else
where
	11 in the explanation of om, as compacted of a + u + m. 
The Aitareya Āraṇyaka
	12 and the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka
	13 
recognize the three forms of the Rigveda text as pratṛṇṇa, 
nirbhuja, and ubhayam-antareṇa, denoting respectively the Saṃ
hitā, Pada, and Krama Pāṭhas of the Rigveda.
	14 The same 
authorities
	15 recognize the importance of the distinction of the 
cerebral and dental n and s, and refer
	16 to the Māṇḍūkeyas' 
mode of recitation. They also discuss
	17 Sandhi, the euphonic 
‘combination’ of letters. 
The Prātiśākhyas of the several Saṃhitās develop in detail 
the grammatical terminology, and Yāska's Nirukta
	18 contains a 
good deal of grammatical material. The Śatapatha Brāh
maṇa
	19 distinguishes the genders, and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh
maṇa
	20 the division of words in the Sāman recitation. 1) Chāndogya Upaniṣad, ii. 22, 5;

स्वराज्
स्व-राज्,
 ‘self-ruler,’ ‘king,’ is found frequently in the 
Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 It is the technical term for the kings of 
the west according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.

can form of government of which 
traces are seen in the Buddhist litera

स्वरु
स्वरु
 in the Rigveda
	1 or later
	2 denotes a ‘post,’ or more 
precisely in the ritual a splinter of the Yūpa, or sacrificial 
post.

22; 8, 1, 5, etc.

स्वर्जित्नाग्नजित
स्वर्-जित् नाग्न-जित
 (‘descendant of Nagna-jit’) is the name 
of a royal personage in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,
	1 a Gandhāra 
prince, whose views on the ritual are referred to with contempt. 1) viii. 1, 4, 10. Cf. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, 1^2, 515.

स्वर्णर
स्वर्-णर
 appears to be the proper name of a sacrificer in 
two verses of the Rigveda.
	1 According to Geldner,
	2 it every
where
	3 means a specially sacred lake and the Soma-producing 
district around it. 1) viii. 3, 12; 12, 2. Cf. Ludwig, 
Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 160; 
Hopkins, Journal of the American Oriental 
Society, 17, 89. 2) Rigveda, Glossar, 209. 3) Rv. iv. 21, 3; v. 18, 4; 14, 1; 
viii. 6, 39; 65, 2; 103, 14; ix. 70, 6; 
x. 65, 4. Perhaps in viii. 12, 2, it 
means ‘coming from Svarṇara.’

स्वर्भानुअसुर
स्वर्-भानु असुर
 is the name, in the Rigveda
	1 and later,
	2 
of a demon supposed to have eclipsed the sun. See Sūrya. 1) v. 40, 5. 6. 8. 9. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 1, 2, 2; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, iv. 5, 2; 6, 13; 
vi. 6, 8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 3, 
2, 2; Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 3.

स्वसर
स्व-सर,
 according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 
denotes ‘cattle stall,’
	1 and more generally ‘dwelling-place,’ 
‘house,’
	2 and then ‘nest of birds.’
	3 Geldner,
	4 however, shows 
that the real sense is the ‘wandering at will’ of cattle, more 
precisely their ‘grazing in the morning,’
	5 and in the case of 
birds their ‘early flight’ from the nest,
	6 while metaphorically 
it is applied first to the morning pressing of Soma and then to 
all three pressings.
	7 1) Rv. i. 3, 8; ii. 2, 2; 34, 8; v. 62, 2; 
viii. 88, 1; Sāmaveda, i. 5, 2, 3, 2. 2) Rv. i. 34, 7; iii. 60, 6; 61, 4; 
vi. 68, 10; viii. 99, 1; Śatapatha

viii. 88, 1. 6) Rv. ii. 19, 2; 34, 5. 7) Rv. i. 34, 7; iii. 60, 6; vi. 68, 10; 
viii. 99, 1. In Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, 
loc. cit., it is equivalent to ‘libation.’

स्वसृ
स्वसृ
 is the regular word from the Rigveda onwards
	1 for 
‘sister.’ Like the word Bhrātṛ, the term sister can be applied 
to things not precisely so related. For example, in the Rigveda 
the fingers and the seasons are ‘sisters,’ and night is the sister 
of dawn, for whom, as the elder, she makes way.
	2 The Paṇis 
offer to adopt Saramā as their sister;
	3 but this use is not 
applied — any more than in the case of Bhrātṛ — to ordinary 
human beings. 
The sister stood in a close relation to her brother. If the 
father was dead or feeble, the sister was dependent on her 
brother and on his wife, as appears from the Rigveda
	4 and the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.
	5 Moreover, maidens without brothers 
were apt to find marriage difficult, and to degenerate into 
Hetairai;
	6 but it is not certain whether this was due, as 
Zimmer
	7 thinks, to brothers being required to arrange 
marriages for orphan girls, or because sonless fathers were 
anxious to make their daughters Putrikās, in order that they 
themselves, instead of the husbands, should count the daughters' 
sons as their own.

हरि-यूपीया
 is mentioned in a hymn of the Rigveda
	1 as the 
scene of the defeat of the Vṛcīvants by Abhyāvartin Cāya- 
mana. It may denote either a place or a river, since many 
battles seem to have been fought on the banks of rivers. 
Ludwig
	2 took it as the name of a town on the river Yavyāvatī, 
which is identified with it in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the 
passage. Hillebrandt
	3 thinks that it is the river Iryāb (Haliāb), 
a tributary of the Kurum (Krumu), but this is not at all 
probable. 1) vi. 27, 5. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3,

Sāyaṇa
	4 that a green Caṭaka bird or a lion (tṛṇa-hiṃsa)
	5 is 
meant. In the Atharvaveda
	6 Halīkṣṇa seems to be some par
ticular intestine, but Weber
	7 thinks it may mean ‘gall.’ 1) Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, iii. 14, 12;

हस्तादान

हस्तिन्
हस्तिन्,
 ‘having a hand,’ with Mṛga, ‘beast,’ denotes in the 
Rigveda
	1 and the Atharvaveda
	2 the ‘elephant.’ Later the 
adjective alone comes to mean ‘elephant.’
	3 The animal was 
famed for its strength
	4 as well as its virility.
	5 It is mentioned 
with man and monkey as one of the beasts that take hold by 
the hand (hastādāna), as opposed to those that take hold by the 
mouth (mukhādāna).
	6 It was tamed, as the expression Hastipa, 
‘elephant-keeper,’ shows, and tame elephants were used to 
catch others (see Vāraṇa). But there is no trace of its use in 
war, though Ktesias and Megasthenes both record such use for 
their times.
	7 The Atharvaveda
	8 alludes to its being pestered 
by mosquitoes. 1) i. 64, 7; iv. 16, 14. 2) xii. 1, 25. Elsewhere Hastin is

हायन
हायन
 denotes a ‘year,’ usually in compounds.
	1 In the 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā
	2 and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	3 the term 
appears as a designation of a species of red rice. As an adjec
tive in the sense of ‘lasting a year’ or ‘recurring every year,’ 
it is applied to fever in the Atharvaveda.
	4 1) Av. viii. 2, 21; śata-hāyana, ‘a 
hundred years old,’ viii. 2, 8; 7, 22;

sion of the Brhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (vi. 4, 30).

हारिद्रव
हारिद्रव
 is the name of a yellow bird in the Rigveda,

Brāhmaṇa, iii. 7, 6, 2, treats it as the 
name of a plant (cf. Zimmer, Altin- 
disches Leben, 62). But on Av. i. 22, 4, 
he takes it as gopītanaka, ‘wagtail.’ 3) Rigveda, Glossar, 213.

 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 is the name of certain ‘veins.’ Cf. 
Hirā. 1) Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, ii. 1, 21; iv. 2, 4; 3, 20; Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, 
iv. 19.

हिम
हिम,
 denoting ‘cold,’ ‘cold weather,’ is quite common in 
the Rigveda,
	1 but less frequent later.
	2 As ‘snow’ the word 
appears as a masculine in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 and often 
later as a neuter.
	4 Cf. Hemanta. 1) i. 116, 8; 119, 6; viii. 32, 26, etc. 2) Av. vii. 18, 2; xiii. 1, 46; xix. 49, 5

Cf. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 
3, 192-195.

हिमवत्|हिमवन्त्
हिमवन्त्,
 ‘snowy,’ appears as an epithet of mountains in 
the Atharvaveda.
	1 It is also used both there
	2 and in the 
Rigveda,
	3 as well as later,
	4 as a noun. There seems no reason 
to deny that in all the passages the word refers vaguely to the 
mountains now called Himālaya, though it is possible that the 
name may include mountains not strictly in that system, like 
the Suleiman hills.
	5 See also Mūjavant and Trikakubh. 1) xii. 1, 11. 2) vi. 95, 3. See also iv. 9, 9; v. 4, 
2. 8; 25. 7; vi. 24, 1 (where reference 
is made to the rivers of the Himālayas);

Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxiv. 30; xxv. 12;

Uttara Kurus and Uttara Madras live 
beyond it; perhaps in Kaśmīr), etc. 5) Ludwig, Translation of the Rig
veda, 3, 198. 
Cf. Zimmer, Altindisches Leven, 29; 
Weber, Indische Studien, 18, 12, who 
inclines to see a reminiscence of the 
Caucasus.

हिमा
हिमा
 denotes ‘winter’ in the combination a ‘hundred 
winters’ in the Rigveda
	1 and elsewhere.
	2 1) i. 64, 14; ii. 33, 2; v. 54, 15; 
vi. 48, 8. 2) Av. ii. 28, 4; xii. 2, 28; Taittirīya 
Saṃhitā, i. 6, 6, 3; Vājasaneyi Saṃ
hitā, ii. 27.

हिरणिन्
हिरणिन्,
 ‘rich in gold,’ is apparently an epithet of Trasa- 
dasyu in one verse of the Rigveda,
	1 referring to the golden 
raiment or possessions of the king. Ludwig,
	2 however, thinks 
the word is a proper name, possibly of Trasadasyu's son. 1) v. 53, 8. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 155.

हिरणिन
हिरणिन
 is found in one passage of the Rigveda,
	1 where 
Ludwig
	2 takes the word as a name of Śāṇḍa. But it seems to 
be an adjectival form of hiraṇin, ‘golden.’ 1) vi. 63, 9. 2) Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 158.

हिरण्य
हिरण्य
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘gold.’ It is 
hardly possible to exaggerate the value attached to gold by the 
Vedic Indians. The metal was, it is clear, won from the bed of 
rivers. Hence the Indus is called ‘golden’
	3 and ‘of golden 
stream.’
	4 Apparently the extraction of gold from the earth was 
known,
	5 and washing for gold is also recorded.
	6 
Gold is the object of the wishes of the Vedic singer,
	7 and 
golden treasures (hiraṇyāni) are mentioned as given by patrons
	8 
along with cows and horses. Gold was used for ornaments for 
neck and breast (Niṣka), for ear-rings (Karṇa-śobhana), and 
even for cups.
	9 Gold is always associated with the gods.
	10 
In the plural Hiraṇya denotes ‘ornaments of gold.’
	11 
A gold currency was evidently beginning to be known in so 
far as definite weights of gold are mentioned: thus a weight, 
aṣṭā-prūḍ, occurs in the Saṃhitās,
	12 and the golden śatamāna, 
‘weight of a hundred (Kṛṣṇalas)’ is found in the same texts.
	13 
In several passages,
	14 moreover, hiraṇya or hiraṇyāni may mean 
‘pieces of gold.’ 
Gold is described sometimes as harita,
	15 ‘yellowish,’ some
times as rajata,
	16 ‘whitish,’ when probably. ‘silver’ is alluded 
to. It was obtained from the ore by smelting.
	17 Mega

हिरण्यकशिपु
हिरण्य-कशिपु
 in the Brāhmaṇas
	1 denotes a ‘golden seat,’ 
probably one covered with cloth of gold. 1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 9, 20, 1; 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, vii. 18, 12. Cf. 
the word as an adjective with the sense 
of ‘having a golden cloth,’ Av. v. 7, 10.

हिरण्यकार
हिरण्य-कार
 denotes a ‘worker in gold’ mentioned in the 
list of victims at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) in the 
Yajurveda.
	1 1) Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxx. 17; Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, iii. 4, 14, 1.

हिरण्यदत्|हिरण्यदन्त्
हिरण्य-दन्त्
 (‘gold-toothed’) Vaida (‘descendant of Veda’) 
is the name of a teacher in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (iii. 6, 3) 
and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka (ii. 1, 5). The name presumably 
refers to the use of gold to stop the teeth; see Dant.

हिरण्यनाभ
हिरण्य-नाभ
 is the name of a Kausalya or Kosala prince, 
whose horse sacrifice appears to be alluded to in the Śāṅkhā
yana Śrauta Sūtra (xvi. 9, 13). He is also referred to in the 
Praśna Upaniṣad (vi. 1), and may have been connected with 
Para Āṭṇāra. Cf. Hairaṇya-nābha.

हिरण्यस्तूप
हिरण्य-स्तूप
 is the name of a man in the Rigveda
	1 and in 
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
	2 He is called an Āṅgirasa in the 
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
	3 which credits him with the authorship of 
a Rigvedic hymn.
	4 The Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes to him 
several other hymns.
	5 1) x. 149, 5. 2) i. 6, 4, 2. 3) iii. 24, 11. 4) i. 32. 5) i. 31-35; ix. 4, 69. Cf. Ludwig, 
Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 104, 141.

हिरण्यहस्त
हिरण्य-हस्त
 is in the Rigveda
	1 the name of a son given 
by the Aśvins to Vadhrimatī (who, as her name denotes, was 
the wife of a eunuch). 1) i. 116, 13; 117, 24; vi. 62, 7; 
x. 39, 7. He appears to be called 
Śyāva in x. 65, 12. Cf. Macdonell, 
Vedic Mythology, p. 52.

हिरा
हिरा
 in the Atharvaveda
	1 denotes ‘vein,’ like Hitā. 1) i. 17, 1; vii. 35, 2; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxv. 8. Cf. Weber, Omina 
und Portenta, 346.

हृत्स्वाशयआल्लकेय
हृत्स्व्-आशय आल्लकेय
 is mentioned in the Jaiminīya Upani
ṣad Brāhmaṇa (iii. 40, 2) in the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) as a 
pupil of Somaśuṣma Sātyayajñi Prācīnayogya.

हृदयामय
हृदयामय,
 ‘disease of the heart,’ is mentioned in the 
Atharvaveda in connexion with Yakṣma
	1 and with Balāsa.
	2 
Zimmer,
	3 who thinks that Balāsa is consumption, connects the 
name with the later view of the medical Saṃhitās,
	4 that love 
is one of the causes of the disease. But it would be more 
natural to see in it a disease affecting the heart. 1) v. 30, 9. 2) vi. 14, 1; 127, 3. 3) Altindisches Leben, 387. 4) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321, 322.

हृद्योत
हृद्-योत
 
	1 (for Hṛd-dyota) and Hṛd-roga,
	2 ‘heart disease,’ 
are mentioned in the Atharvaveda and the Rigveda respec
tively. Zimmer
	3 identifies the disease in the Atharvaveda with 
Hṛdayāmaya, ‘consumption caused by love.’ In the Rigveda 
this is not at all likely: later in the medical Saṃhitās the word 
probably denotes angina pectoris.
	4 1) Av. i. 22, 1. Cf. vi. 24, 1. 2) Rv. i. 50, 11. 3) Altindisches Leben, 388. 4) Wise, Hindu System of Medicine, 321.

हेमन्
हेमन्
 (used only in the locative singular) denotes ‘winter’ 
in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.
	1 1) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 6, 1, 1; 
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxxvi. 6; Taittirīya 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 10, 10; Śatapatha 
Brāhmaṇa, i. 5, 4, 5; xi. 2, 7, 32.

हेमन्त
हेमन्त,
 ‘winter,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda,
	1 but 
often in the later texts.
	2 Zimmer
	3 is inclined to trace 
differences of climate in the Rigveda: he thinks that certain 
hymns,
	4 which ignore winter and insist on the rains, indicate a 
different place and time of origin from those which refer to the 
snowy mountains.
	5 It is, however, quite impossible to separate 
parts of the Rigveda on this basis. It is probable that that 
text owes its composition in the main to residents in the later 
Madhyadeśa; hence the references to cold and snow are rather 
a sign of local than of temporal differences. It is otherwise 
with the later expansion of the three into four seasons, 
which represents clearly the earlier advance of the Indians 
(see Ṛtu). 
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
	6 describes winter as the time 
when the plants wither, the leaves fall from the trees, the birds 
fly low and retire more and more. 1) x. 161, 4. 2) Av. vi. 55, 2; viii. 2, 22; xii. 
1, 36; Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 7, 2, 
4; Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xiii. 58; 
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxi. 15, 2; 
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 4, 10, 10; 
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, x. 4, 5, 2 
etc. 3) Altindisches Leben, 40. 4) Rv. vii. 103; x. 90. 5) Rv. x. 68, 10; 121, 4 (both these 
are not early hymns). 6) i. 5, 4, 5.

हैतनामन
हैत-नामन,
 ‘descendant of Hitanāman,’ is the patro
nymic of a teacher apparently called Āhṛta in the Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā,
	1 though the verse is a strange one. 1) iii. 4, 6. See Pāṇini, vi. 4, 170, Vārttika, and von Schroeder, Maitrāyaṇī 
Saṃhitā, 2, ix.

हैरण्यनाभ
हैरण्य-नाभ,
 ‘descendant of Hiraṇyanābha,’ is the 
patronymic of Para Āṭṇāra, the Kosala king, in a Gāthā 
occurring in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (xiii. 5, 4, 4).

होतृ
होतृ
 is the name of one of the oldest and most important 
priests of the Vedic ritual, the counterpart of the Zaotar of the 
Avestan priesthood.
	1 The word must be derived from hu, 
‘sacrifice,’ as was held by Aurṇavābha;
	2 this indicates a time 
when the Hotṛ was at once sacrificer (the later Adhvaryu) and 
singer. But the functions were already clearly divided in the 
Rigveda, where the Hotṛ's chief duty was the recitation of the 
Śastras. He was also in the older period often the Purohita 
of the king, an office later filled by the Brahman priest. 1) Rv. i. 1, 1; 14, 11; 139, 10, etc.; 
Hotra, the ‘Hotṛ's office,’ Rv. ii. 1, 2; 
36, 1; 37, 1, etc. 2) Nirukta. iv. 26. Cf. Oldenberg, 
Religion des Veda, 380 et seq.

होत्रक
होत्रक
 in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa
	1 denotes ‘assistant of 
the Hotṛ’ priest. 1) ii. 36, 5; vi. 6, 2. In the Sūtras 
it is variously used — sometimes in this 
sense, sometimes more widely — so as 
to include all the priests except the 
four chief priests (cf. Āśvalāyana Śrauta 
Sūtra, v. 6, 17).

ह्यस्
ह्यस्
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes ‘yesterday.’ 1) viii. 66, 7; 99, 1; x. 55, 5. 2) Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 9, 3.

ह्रद
ह्रद
 in the Rigveda
	1 and later
	2 denotes a ‘lake’ or 
‘pond.’ 1) i. 52, 7; iii. 36, 8; 45, 3; x. 43, 7; 
71, 7; 102, 4; 142, 8, etc. 2) Av. iv. 15, 4; vi. 37, 2; Pañca
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xxv. 10, 18; Śata
patha Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 5, 12; 4, 5, 10; 
xi. 5, 5, 8, etc.

ह्रदेचक्षुस्
ह्रदे-चक्षुस्
 in one passage of the Rigveda
	1 is thought by 
Jackson
	2 to mean ‘will of the wisp.’ 1) x. 95, 6. 2) Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, May, 1890, iv.

ह्रस्वमाण्डूकेय
ह्रस्व माण्डूकेय
 (‘descendant of Maṇḍūka’) is the name 
of a teacher in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.
	1 1) iii. 1, 5; 2, 1. 6. Cf. Weber, 
Indische Studien, 1, 391. The word 
must be regarded as a proper name, 
given from a personal characteristic, 
much as Sthavira is used.

ह्रादुनि
ह्रादुनि
 denotes ‘hail’ in the Rigveda
	1 and later.
	2 1) i. 32, 13; v. 54, 3. 2) Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vii. 4, 13, 1; 
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā, xxii. 26; xxvi. 9, 
etc.

ह्रूडु
ह्रूडु
 is a word of unknown meaning applied to Takman in 
the Atharvaveda.
	1 It is variously spelled in the manuscript as 
hruḍa, hūḍu, rūḍu, and so forth; the Paippalāda recension 
reads huḍu, ‘ram.’ Henry
	2 has conjectured that the word is 
the equivalent of a proto-Semitic ḥarāḍu, ‘gold’ (Assyrian 
huraçu and Hebrew ḥarāç), while Halévy
	3 suggests that it may 
be the Greek  ‘greenish-yellow’; but both conjectures 
are highly improbable.
	4 Weber
	5 thinks ‘cramp’ is meant. 1) i. 25, 2. 3. 2) Journal Asiatique, 9th series, 10, 513. 3) Ibid., 11, 320 et seq. 4) Macdonell, Journal of the Royal

tion of the Atharvaveda, 26; Bloom
field, Hymns of the Atharvaveda, 273.

ह्वरस्
ह्वरस्
 in three passages of the Rigveda
	1 denotes, according 
to Roth,
	2 a part of the Soma sieve, perhaps the part through 
which the Soma juice flowed. But Geldner
	3 thinks that in all 
these cases the sense is merely ‘hindrance.’ 1) ix. 3, 2; 63, 4; 106, 13. 2) St. Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. 1;
